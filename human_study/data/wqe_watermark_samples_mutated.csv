1227567691,How does backpropagation work?,"Backpropagation is an essential algorithm in machine learning and neural networks, (almost) everybody's favorite topic!

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation is a method for supervised learning in artificial neural networks. It allows the network to learn the weights and biases that minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Forward Propagation**

* The network processes the input data and produces an output.
* This output is compared to the desired output to calculate the **error** or **loss**.

**Step 2: Backward Propagation**

* The error is propagated backwards through the network to determine how much each node contributed to the error.
* This is done by computing the **gradients** of the loss with respect to each weight and bias.
* Gradients tell us how much changing a particular weight or bias will affect the overall loss.

**Step 3: Weight Update**

* Using the gradients calculated in Step 2,the network updates its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
* This process is typically repeated multiple times during training to ensure the network converges on an optimal set of weights and biases.
