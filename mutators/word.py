    "Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. There is no doubt that there are many superhero movies out there but it has been.
    Captain marvel and the kree-skrull war explained:
    Marvel Studios released the first trailer for Captain Marvel on September 18, 2018, and it gave us our first look at Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. However, the trailer didn't delve too deeply into the plot or the characters. But now, thanks to some new promo art and details from the film's stars and director, we have a better understanding of what's going on in the movie.

    Captain marvel trailer breakdown:

    The Captain Marvel trailer shows us a mix of action, humor, and emotional moments, giving us a glimpse into the life of Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), aka Captain Marvel. Here's a breakdown of what we see in the trailer:

        * The opening shot shows Carol crashing into a Blockbuster Video store in the '90s, which gives away the time period of the film.
        * We then cut to Carol in her suit, looking fierce and ready for battle.
        * Next, we see Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) without his iconic eye patch, which suggests this might be before he lost his eye.
        * The trailer cuts to a montage of action sequences, showing Carol fighting Kree warriors and destroying enemy ships.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ

    3,"Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. Here are some fun facts about the movie.

    **1. The Movie Was Written and Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck**: Boden is the first female director to helm a solo superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). She previously directed It's Kind of a Funny Story (2010) and Mississippi Grind (2015).

    **2. Brie Larson Trained for Nine Months to Prepare for the Role**: The actress underwent intense physical training, including martial arts, stunt training, and weightlifting, to play Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Her hard work paid off â€“ she can do most of her own stunts!

    **3. The Film Takes Inspiration from the Comics**: The story draws inspiration from Kelly Sue DeConnick's comic book run, particularly the 2014 series Captain Marvel Vol. 7: Earth's Mightiest Hero. Fans of the comics will recognize nods to iconic characters, like Goose the cat.

    **4. Skrulls Were Created Using Advanced VFX Technology**: To bring the shapeshifting aliens to life, visual effects company Digital Domain developed cutting-edge technology to create realistic facial expressions and movements. No prosthetics or makeup were used for the Skrull designs.

    **5. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury Has a Few Surprises**: In this '90s-set film, Nick Fury is a younger, more optimistic agent."
