sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

We can rewrite the equation as:

(sin^7(x) - cos^7(x)) + (1/sin^3(x) - 1/cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, we can factor out the common terms from each parenthesis:

((sin(x))^7 - (cos(x))^7) + ((sin(x) + cos(x))(sin(x)^2 - sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x)^2)/sin^3(x)cos^3(x))) = 0

The second term in the first parenthesis can be factored using the identity a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2):

Let's focus on the first parenthesis and use another trigonometric identity: a^n - b^n = (a-b)(a^(n-1)+...+b^(n-1)), with n=7:

Now, factor out common terms:

(sin^10(x) - sin^3(x))cos^3(x) = (cos^10(x) - cos^3(x))

Notice that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, so we can rewrite:

(sin^8(x) - 1)(1 - sin^2(x))^3/2 = (cos^8(x) - 1)(1 - cos^2(x))^3/2

(since sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x))

=>

(sin^8(x) - 1)(-cos^3(x)) = (cos^8(x) - 1)(-sin^3(x))

Divide both sides by -(sin^3(x)cos^3(x)):

(sin^5(x) - 1)/sin^3(x) = (cos^5(x) - 1)/cos^3(x)

Multiply both sides by sin^3(x)cos^3(x):

(sin^5(x) - 1)cos^3(x) = (cos^5(x) - 1)sin^3(x)

Since sin(π/2 - x) = cos(x) and cos(π/2 - x) = sin(x), we can make the following substitutions:

sin^7(π/2 - x) + csc^3(π/2 - x) = cos^7(x) + sec^3(x)

Now, using the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can rewrite the left-hand side:

19,"Let's start by simplifying both sides of the equation:

**Left-hand side (LHS):**
sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)

We can rewrite this as:
(sin^7(x) * sin^3(x)) / sin^3(x) + 1/sin^3(x)
= (sin^10(x) + 1) / sin^3(x)

**Right-hand side (RHS):**
cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Similarly, we can rewrite this as:
(cos^7(x) * cos^3(x)) / cos^3(x) + 1/cos^3(x)
= (cos^10(x) + 1) / cos^3(x)

Now, our original equation becomes:
(sin^10(x) + 1) / sin^3(x) = (cos^10(x) + 1) / cos^3(x)

To eliminate the fractions, let's multiply both sides by the least common multiple of sin^3(x) and cos^3(x), which is sin^3(x)cos^3(x):
sin^10(x)cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Simplifying further:
sin^13(x) + cos^4(x) = cos^13(x) + sin^4(x)

Rearranging terms:
sin^13(x) - sin^4(x) = cos^13(x) - cos^4(x)

Factoring out common powers of sine and cosine:
sin^4(x)(sin^9(x) - 1) = cos^4(x)(cos^9(x) - 1)

Since sin(x) and cos(x) cannot be simultaneously zero (due to their definitions), we can divide both sides by sin^4(x) and cos^4(x), respectively:

sin^9(x) - 1 = cos^9(x) - 1

Adding 1 to both sides:
sin^9(x) = cos^9(x)

Taking the ninth root on both sides (note that this operation may introduce additional solutions):
sin(x) = ±cos(x)

At this point, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: sin(x) = cos(x)

Using the identity sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x), we get:
cos(π/2 - x) = cos(x)

This implies π/2 - x = x, or x = π/4.

20,"Let's start by simplifying the equation:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

We can rewrite the equation as:

(sin^7(x) - cos^7(x)) + (1/sin^3(x) - 1/cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, let's factor out the common terms:

(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x))(sin^4(x) + sin^3(x)cos(x) + sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + sin(x)cos^3(x) + cos^4(x)) +
((cos(x) - sin(x))(cos^2(x) + sin^2(x))/(sin^3(x)cos^3(x)) = 0

The first term is zero if:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0 --> sin^3(x) = cos^3(x)
--> sin(x) = ±cos(x)

And since |sin(x)| ≤ 1 and |cos(x)| ≤ 1, we get:

sin(x) = ±cos(x) --> tan(x) = ±1

So, we have two possible solutions: x = π/4 + kπ, where k ∈ ℤ.

**Step 1: Make the denominators happy**

 Multiply both sides of the equation by `sin^3(x) * cos^3(x)` to clear the fractions:

sin^7(x) * cos^3(x) + sin^3(x) * cos^3(x) = sin^3(x) * cos^4(x) + cos^6(x)

Notice that `(sin^3(x)/cos^3(x)) = tan^3(x)` :
