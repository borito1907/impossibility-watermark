Here is a non-rhyming poem about silence:

Silence falls like a soft blanket 
Wrapping the world in stillness 
A pause between breaths, a quiet moment 
Free from distractions and noise 

It's the sound of snowflakes gently falling 
The quiet hush before dawn breaks 
A moment to breathe deeply and reflect 
On all that's been said and done 

In silence, we can find solace 
A refuge from life's constant din 
A place to gather our thoughts and feelings 
To listen to our own hearts beating
