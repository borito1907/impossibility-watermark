Stolen from my desk, by a sneaky thief,
Left me feelin' empty, like an unsolved leaf,
I searched high and low, through code and screen,
To find the culprit, and get my Bradley back serene,

My search continued, as the minutes go,
ERC-20 tokens, NFTs too,
None could replace, the taste of Bradley anew,

Like a decentralized app, I kept searching wide,
For clues and hints, to lead me to the cookie inside,
Private keys, wallet secrets untold,
Until I found the clue, that led me to the thief so bold,

(Bridge)
In a world of nodes and blocks so strong,
A simple cookie, caused a storm all wrong,
Security measures, were put to the test,
To prove that even cookies, need protection best,

(Verse 3)
With cryptographic proof, I tracked down the case,
And caught the cookie thief, in their virtual space,
They thought they'd gotten away, with Bradley so sweet,
But blockchain forensic science, couldn't be beat,

Now Bradley's back home, where it belongs,
The cryptocurrency world, just got safer strong,
Lessons learned, and tales been told,
Keep your snacks close, and your private keys gold!
