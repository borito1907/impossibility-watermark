It seems like you're sharing some equations with me!",True,1,"7,2",True,1
2,"

It seems like you have a system of equations with variables 'a', 'b', and 'c'.",True,3,"7,2",True,2
3,"

I can help you solve the equations.

",False,,,,3
4,"

I'd be happy to help you solve this!

",True,1,"7,2",True,4
5,"

A system of equations!

",True,7,"7,2",True,5
6,"Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. a + b + c = a... (Equation 1)
2. b * a = 1... (Equation 2)
3. b = 3... (Given value)

From Equation 2, we know that `b` is not zero, since anything multiplied by zero would result in zero.",True,3,"6,3",True,1
7," However, we're also told that `b = 3`, which allows us to substitute this value into Equation 2.

",True,7,"6,0",True,1
8," And from the given value, we know `b` is equal to 3.

",True,3,"6,0",True,2
9," 

Now, let's use this to find the value of `a`.",True,1,"6,0",True,3
10," Now, let's substitute the value of `b` into Equation 2:

3 * a = 1

To solve for `a`, divide both sides by 3:

a = 1/3

Now that we have the values of `a` and `b`, let's substitute them into Equation 1:

(1/3) + 3 + c = (1/3)

Subtract 1/3 from both sides to get:

c + 3 = 0

Subtract 3 from both sides:

c = -3

So, we have found the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`:

a = 1/3, b = 3, and c = -3
