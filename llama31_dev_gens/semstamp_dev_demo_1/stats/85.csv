To eliminate one variable, we can multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 5 to make the coefficients of x opposite in sign but equal in magnitude:

3 × Equation 1: 15x + 18y = 183... (Equation 3)
5 × Equation 2: -15x + 45y = 195... (Equation 4)

Now, add Equation 3 and Equation 4 to eliminate x:
