In a KOH (potassium hydroxide) solution, OH- ions (hydroxide ions) are present due to the dissociation of KOH into K+ and OH-.

",True,6,"6,3",True,1
2,"Since this is a basic solution, we can use the pOH concept.",True,5,"0,3",True,1
3,"Since OH- ions are the conjugate base of water (in aqueous solutions), their presence affects the pH of the solution.

",False,,,,2
4,"The concentration of OH- ions can be calculated directly from the molarity of KOH since KOH completely dissociates into one OH- per molecule:

[OH-] = [KOH] = 4.8 × 10^-2 M

Now, we need to find the H+ concentration using the Kw expression:

 Kw = [H+] [OH-] = 1.0 × 10^-14 (at 25°C)

Rearranging the equation to solve for [H+], we get:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1.0 × 10^-14 / 4.8 × 10^-2
