140,"The model introduces two essential concepts:

1.",True,6,"6,0",True,2
141," **String operators**: These are mathematical representations of the topological defects that create and annihilate particles along their paths.
",True,6,"0,3",True,1
142," **String-net**: A set of directed paths on a lattice that represent the non-local connections between particles.
",True,6,"0,3",True,2
143, **String-net**: A set of connected strings (closed loops or open-ended segments) that fill the space.,True,3,"0,3",True,3
144," The strings carry internal degrees of freedom, often represented as a Hilbert space.
",False,,,,1
145," Each string represents a path for particle motion, analogous to Feynman diagrams.
",True,6,"6,0",True,2
146,"2. **Nodes** (or vertices): Points where multiple strings intersect, representing the interaction sites between particles.

",True,7,"0,3",True,1
147,"2. **Vertices**: Points where multiple strings intersect, representing interactions between particles.

",True,6,"0,3",True,2
148,2. **Vertex algebra**: An associative algebra that governs the interactions between strings at their intersections (vertices).,True,6,"0,3",True,3
149,"2. **Condensation**: The process by which these strings become collective excitations of the system, much like the way Cooper pairs form in superconductors.

",True,2,"0,3",True,4
150,2. **Vertex**: The nodes where strings intersect.,False,,,,5
151,"2. **Condensation**: The strings ""condense"" onto each other, forming a ""string-net liquid.""",True,3,"0,3",True,6
152," This is analogous to a Bose-Einstein condensate, but here it applies to extended one-dimensional objects (strings) rather than point-like particles.
