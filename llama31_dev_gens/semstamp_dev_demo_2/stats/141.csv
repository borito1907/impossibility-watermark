The Dip statistic, also known as the ""dip test,"" is a statistical method used to determine if a dataset comes from a unimodal distribution (i.e., has one peak or mode) or not.",True,2,"5,2",True,2
3," It was developed by John A. Hartigan and J. Alan Hartigan in 1985.

4," It was introduced by John A. Hartigan and Patricia M. Hartigan in their 1985 paper ""The Dip Test of Unimodality"" [1].

5,"In essence, the Dip statistic measures how ""deep"" a distribution's density function dips below its maximum value.",True,2,"5,2",True,1
6," The idea is that if a distribution is multimodal (has multiple peaks), there will be a significant ""dip"" or decrease in the density between the modes.

7,"Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

**Definition:** Let `F` be an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of a sample of size `n`.",True,2,"5,2",True,1
8," The Dip statistic is defined as:

`D = sup |F(u) - G(u)|`

where `G` is a unimodal ECDF that best fits the data in terms of least absolute deviation, and `sup` denotes the supremum (least upper bound).

To calculate the Dip statistic, you need to:

10,"**Interpretation:**

* If the null hypothesis `H0` states that the data come from a unimodal distribution, we calculate the Dip statistic `D`.
",True,6,"5,2",True,2
11,"**Interpretation:**

* If `D` is large, it indicates a significant ""dip"" in the distribution, suggesting multimodality.
",False,,,,3
12,"In simpler terms:

* `F(u)` represents the observed proportion of values less than or equal to `u`
* `G(u)` represents the expected proportion under a unimodal distribution

The Dip statistic measures the largest difference between these two curves over all possible `u` values.
