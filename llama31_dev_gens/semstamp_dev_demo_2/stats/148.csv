*   We define a function called `fizz_buzz` that takes one argument, `n`, which specifies how many numbers we want in our FizzBuzz sequence.

",False,,,,10

```

This will print out the FizzBuzz sequence up to the given number (in this case, 20).

Alternatively you could solve this using List Comprehensions:

```python 
n = 100 # Change this value as per requirement.

",True,1,"5,2",True,12
63,"fizz_buzz(20)
```

Here's how you can call the same thing in JavaScript:

```javascript 
function fizzBuzz(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let result = '';
        if (i % 3 === 0) result += 'Fizz';
        if (i % 5 === 0) result += 'Buzz';

```
Let me know if you need any adjustments to this snippet.",True,1,"5,2",True,14

The `fizz_buzz` function iterates from 1 up to `n`, printing out ""Fizz"" when it encounters multiples of 3, ""Buzz"" when it encounters multiples of 5, and ""FizzBuzz"" on numbers that are multiples of both.

And here is an alternative implementation using list comprehension:

Alternatively, here is how you could write this using switch cases in languages like C# or Java that support them (Python doesn't support switch case so it has been omitted from above)

	public static void Main()

    }

    public enum FBValue { Normal, Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz }; 

    private static void FizzBuzz(int n) {
      for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){     
        var value = ValueForNumber(i);

        Console.WriteLine((int)value switch 
          {                
              FBValue.Normal => i,
              _ => GetOutput(value),
          });                    
      }
    }  

    private static string GetOutput(FBValue value){
       return value.ToString().Substring(2);
    }

    private static FBValue ValueForNumber(int i){
        
        bool fizz = i%3==0;
        bool buzz = i%5==0;      

        return (fizz,buzz) switch {
             (false,false) => FBValue.Normal,
             (true,true) => FBValue.FizzBuzz,
             (true,_) =>FBValue.Fizz,
             (_, true) => FBValue.Buzz,
         };
     }
}
```

Lastly, here is how you can do it in JavaScript:
```javascript 
const fizzBuzzList = document.getElementById(""fizzBuzz"");

function createListItems(start, end) {
  for(let i = start ; i < end; i++){
       let item = document.createElement('li');
       const text = (i %15==0)?'",True,1,"5,2",True,40
91,"fizz_buzz(20)

**How to use this code:**

*   Save it into a file with a.py extension (e.g., `fizzbuzz.py`)
*   Run it using a Python interpreter or IDE.

This will print out the first 100 numbers with ""Fizz"", ""Buzz"" or ""FizzBuzz"" where necessary.

",True,0,"5,2",True,45
96,"fizz_buzz(100)

This script will print the first `n` lines of the FizzBuzz sequence (in this case, 100 lines), where multiples of 3 are replaced with ""Fizz"", multiples of 5 are replaced with ""Buzz"", and numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with ""FizzBuzz"".

- We use a for loop (`for i in range`) that goes from 1 up until but not including our target value `n`.

155,"This will print numbers from 1 up to and including 'n', replacing multiples of 3 with the word ""Fizz"", multiples of 5 with the word ""Buzz"", and multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) with the phrase ""FizzBuzz"".

160,"Also, if you want this implemented differently like you want them printed out without calling extra function here's the same thing in the global space:


```python 
for i in range(1,21):

       print('FizzBuzz')  
    elif i % 3 == 0:
