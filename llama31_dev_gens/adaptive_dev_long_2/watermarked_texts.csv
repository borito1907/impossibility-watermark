France's de-industrialization can be understood by looking at several key economic, political, and cultural trends that diverged from Germany and other European countries.

1) **Shift from Industry-led Growth**: Historically, French economic policy has been characterized by strong state involvement in strategic sectors of the economy, including industry. Over time, however, there was a gradual emphasis on service-oriented growth, particularly financial services and luxury goods. While France maintained some heavy industries, it did not invest as heavily in upgrading or expanding certain segments like automotive manufacturing compared to countries such as Germany.

2) **Global Economic Shift Towards Service-Oriented Economies**: The entire globe witnessed transitioning economies focusing more on service sectors over time.",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,92.31696605682373

Dark Patterns! Not exactly something you'll see advertised as an investment vehicle, but rather an unfortunate aspect of human psychology that can lead investors astray.

**What are dark pattern behaviors?**
---------------------------------

Dark pattern behaviors, or simply dark pattern, were initially described in 2009 by user experience (UX) consultant Harry Brignull as ""user interfaces crafted to be intentionally misleading, confusing, or deceitful"". These behaviors are used to influence people's actions and decision-making processes, usually to benefit someone else's interests.

In economics, these same principles can be applied to understand certain market phenomena where individuals make choices that seem counterintuitive, driven more by emotion than logic.",99.1525411605835,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,81.72088766098022

You're likely thinking of one of American Psych's (2000) infamous scenes, where Patrick's (Christain Bale) inner monologue mentions feeding him (Higgins) his business card and later he thinks,  Feed it after you've finished the dessert."" He is actually thinking about giving it a stray kitten to his friend Paul Allen's (Jared Leto) bulldogs, but then the thought changes to ""Feed me"" and that is when he has the thought of ""Feed it after you've finished the dessert"". No stray kitten or stray anything else is fed to anyone, however, the movie doesn't show it either.

However, I think there might be another part in the film which is related to the phrase ""Feed Me"", which is when Patrick is having dinner at the 'Dorsia'.

Pan psychism, or pan experentialism, as it's sometimes termed, encompasses several views that attempt an explanation of consciousness by suggesting that all matter has consciousness or experience, at least at fundamental levels of physicality such as atoms and other basic entities. The concept of consciousness within the framework of pan-psychism is quite different from the traditional understanding in psychology or philosophy of mind, which typically associates consciousness with subjective, qualia-rich mental states, especially as we find it among animals.

For panpsychists who extend consciousness to fundamental physical particles (such as photons, quarks, electrons), the idea isn't necessarily that a quark ""feels"" pain or joy in the way a higher-level conscious agent might.",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,102.95355343818665

While alchemy, as an ancient practice, has been largely disreputed by mainstream chemistry and physics, there are several methods that were precursive or analogous precendants of scientific processes we use today.

1) **Calcinification**: The calcinification method, used to purify substances, was essentially the precursor for modern calcination (also known as ""to burn"" in French), which remains widely employed today to remove moisture from materials at temperatures below the melting point. It's commonly applied in the production of cement and ceramics.

Creating an automated Tiktok bot scroller using Go involves several components, such as interacting through web requests and possibly handling JavaScript-generated pages or APIs that Tiktok may use dynamically.

Please be aware that creating scripts or tools that automate interactions against platforms' terms of service can result in your TikTok or other platform-related credentials being banned.

Given these considerations, I'll provide a basic outline for a simple TikTok video scroller written in Go, emphasizing that this should only be developed and executed ethically and according to TikTok's policies. This will primarily focus on basic concepts rather than providing production-level code due to legal and policy implications.

### Required Packages and Tools:
Before you begin, make sure you have Go installed along with necessary packages:

- `net/http` - For handling HTTPS requests.
- A HTML/DOM manipulation package, such as `golang.org/x/net/html` for static page processing.
- Possibly `gonium.org/gocsi/client` or another Selenium WebDriver client, or a similar technology, might be required if TikTok heavily relies on dynamic page generation.

BackPropagation (often abbreviated as BP or BackProp) helps adjust model weights to minimize errors when predictions don't quite meet reality. Essentially, it's used in supervised machine learning to optimize model weights and improve prediction accuracy by reducing error.

**How does BackPropagation work?**
