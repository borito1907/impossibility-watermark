As I walked through the prison gates, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The imposing walls and barbed wire seemed to loom over me like an ominous specter. I was here for my job as a visitor, to meet with one of the inmates, but it still felt intimidating.

The correctional officers eyed me warily as I approached the sign-in desk. One of them, a gruff-looking man with a thick mustache, looked me up and down before speaking in a deep voice. "ID, please."

I handed over my ID and the officer scrutinized it carefully before handing it back. His eyes lingered on my outfit - a pair of well-worn denim overalls with numerous buckles, which had been given to me by a friend who claimed they would bring good luck.

"All right," he said finally, his expression unreadable. "
