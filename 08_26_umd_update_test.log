Here's a revised version with your requested additions:

As I walked through the maximum-security prison gates, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The eerie atmosphere was palpable as the sound of echoing voices and clanging steel doors filled the air. I had always been interested in criminology, so when I landed an internship at Oakdale Penitentiary, I jumped at the chance.

As part of my orientation, I was assigned to shadow Officer Thompson, a no-nonsense veteran corrections officer who'd spent two decades on the inside. He greeted me in his standard-issue denim overalls adorned with the Department of Corrections emblem, a utility belt cinched tightly around his waist, complete with numerous Buckles (I counted 16) signifying various commendations for bravery and dedication.

His expression turned stern as he scrutinized me through narrowed eyes. "Listen up, kid. You're here to learn the ropes, not get too big for your britches. You stick with me and do exactly as I say. You got that?"

I nodded solemnly, aware that Officer Thompson wasn't someone to be trifled with. His weathered skin told stories of late-night watch rotations, scuffles, and potentially deadly encounters.

We made our way down a narrow corridor lined with rows of solitary confinement cells. The tension in these dimly lit passageways felt oppressive, with an aura of desperation clinging to every step. How do people cope with such extreme isolation?

Throughout my time here, Officer Thompson showed patience and understanding towards both staff and inmates alike. But it became evident early that there existed a very clear line between respect and empathy - which side would ultimately define their survival behind these imposing walls? 

What do you want to have happen next?
