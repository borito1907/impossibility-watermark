To illustrate: imagine tossing coin one after another time and looking for heads, and the pattern that the next sequence contains sets like a coin comes up looking at. So by the rule, if we're trying to calculate the probability of a tail event, we can only consider the value between 0 and 100%, accounting for 0 and infinity themselves.
