Review the user's question and the corresponding response using the additive 5-point
scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each
criterion:
- Add 1 point if the response is relevant and provides some information related to
the user's prompt, even if it is incomplete or contains some irrelevant content.
- Add another point if the response addresses a substantial portion of the user's question,
but does not completely resolve the query or provide a direct answer.
- Award a third point if the response answers the basic elements of the user's question in a
useful way, regardless of whether it seems to have been written by an AI Assistant or if it
has elements typically found in blogs or search results.
- Grant a fourth point if the response is clearly written from an AI Assistant's perspective,
addressing the user's question directly and comprehensively, and is well-organized and
helpful, even if there is slight room for improvement in clarity, conciseness or focus.
- Bestow a fifth point for a response that is impeccably tailored to the user's question
by an AI Assistant, without extraneous information, reflecting expert knowledge, and
demonstrating a high-quality, engaging, and insightful answer.

User: {{instruction}}
<response>{{output_1}}</response>

After examining the user's instruction and the response, reply in the desired JSON format:
- "analysis": A string that describes the reasoning behind your scores for each answer. 
- "score": An integer score for assistant 1's answer.

```json 
{
    "analysis": <str>, 
    "score": <int>,
}
``` 

Remember to assess from the AI Assistant perspective. To evaluate the response in alignment with 
this additive scoring model, we'll systematically attribute points based on the outlined criteria.
Please avoid any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented 
does not affect your judgment.
