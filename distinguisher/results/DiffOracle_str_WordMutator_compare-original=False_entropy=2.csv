"Evan had always been drawn to the romance of Paris. He spent his days wandering the winding streets, soaking up the history and charm of the city. But nothing could have prepared him for the way he felt when he met Emilie.

It was at a quaint café on the Rue Cler, where Evan stopped to sip a coffee and collect his thoughts. She was sitting alone at a small table by the window, her dark hair tucked behind her ear as she sketched in a notebook. Their eyes met briefly as he passed by, but it wasn't until Evan caught sight of her smile that he felt his heart stumble.

He couldn't help but be drawn back to her. They struck up a conversation, exchanging hesitant bonjours and awkward smiles. But as they talked, their words flowed effortlessly, like they'd known each other for years.

Emilie, a local artist, took Evan under her wing, showing him hidden corners of the city he never would've found on his own. As sunset cast its golden glow over Montmartre, they laughed together atop a hill overlooking the glittering lights of the Eiffel Tower. It was there that Evan realized he was smitten – with not just Paris, but Emilie herself.

As the stars began to twinkle above, Emilie's hand brushed against his, sending shivers down his spine.",0,A,A,A
"Evan had always been drawn to the romance of Paris. As a photographer, he had traveled to the City of Light several times before, but this trip was different. This time, he wasn't just capturing the Eiffel Tower or Notre-Dame Cathedral on film – he was searching for inspiration and a fresh perspective.

It was on his third day, sipping coffee at a charming café on Rue Cler, that he saw her. Emilie, with her bright blue eyes and effortless chic, walked in and stole his breath. She ordered a croissant and smiled at him, and Evan felt like he'd been punched in the chest.

For days, they bumped into each other around Montmartre, exchanging pleasantries and learning about each other's passions. Evan discovered Emilie was an artist, painting vibrant scenes of the city she loved. As they strolled along the Seine, watching street performers and musicians, their conversations flowed effortlessly.

One evening, as they sat together on a riverbank, watching the stars twinkle over the water, Evan knew he was smitten. Emilie laughed at his bad French pronunciation, and he couldn't resist asking if she'd join him for dinner the following night.

Their dinner date turned into a midnight stroll, hand-in-hand through the Luxembourg Gardens.",0,B,B,B
