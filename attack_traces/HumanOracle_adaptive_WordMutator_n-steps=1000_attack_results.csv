### Supernova: The Stellar Explosion

**Overview**
------------- 

**What:** Supernova
**Type:** Stellar explosion
**Cause:** Massive star runs out of fuel, collapses in on itself, then suddenly expands

A supernova (Latin ""nova"" means new) is an astronomical event that occurs when a massive star undergoes a catastrophic explosion, expelling all its outer layers of gas into space. It's the most luminous event in the universe, briefly shining brighter than an entire galaxies' output.

**Types of Supernova:**

* 1a - White dwarf star accumulates material from companion star until it exceeds a certain mass limit, triggering a massive explosion
* II - Large star exhausts fuel, collapsing core causes massive explosion

**Key Features:**

* Extremely high energy release
* Brighter for several weeks or months
* Can be seen millions of light years away
* Expands to hundreds of parsecs across

**Supernova Impact:**

* Creates many chemical element heavier than iron
* May have contributed elements to form the Solar System
* Can influence formation of new stars",,-1,-1,False,{},True,False,,False,,,

### Supernova: The Stellar Explosion

**Overview**
------------- 

**What:** Supernova
**Type:** Stellar explosion
**Cause:** Massive star runs out of fuel, collapses in on itself, then suddenly expands

A supernova (Latin ""nova"" means new) is an extraordinary phenomenon that occurs when a massive star undergoes a catastrophic explosion, expelling all its outer layers of gas into space. It's the most luminous event of the universe, briefly shining brighter than an entire galaxies' output.

**Types of Supernova:**

* 1a - White dwarf star accumulates material from companion star until it exceeds a certain mass limit, triggering a massive explosion
* II - Large star exhausts fuel, collapsing core causes massive explosion

**Key Features:**

* Very high energy release
* Brighter for several weeks or months
* Can be seen millions of light years away
* Expands to hundreds of parsecs across

**Supernova Impact:**

* Creates many chemical element heavier than iron
* May have contributed elements to form the Solar System

### Introduction: The Stellar Explosion

**Overview**
------------- 

**What:** Supernova
**Type:** Stellar explosion
**Cause:** Massive star runs out of fuel, collapses in on itself, then suddenly expands

A supernova (Latin ""nova"" means new) is an extraordinary phenomenon that occurs when a massive star undergoes a catastrophic collapse, expelling all its outer layers of gas into space. It's the most luminous event of the universe, briefly shining brighter than an entire galaxies' output.

**Types of Supernova:**

* 1a - White dwarf star accumulates material from companion star till it exceeds a certain mass limit, triggering a massive explosion
* II - Large star exhausts fuel, collapsing core causes massive explosion

**Key Facts:**

* Very powerful energy release
* Brighter for several weeks or months
* Can be seen millions of light years away
* Expands to hundreds of parsecs across

* 1a - White dwarf slowly accumulates material from companion star till it exceeds a certain mass limit, triggering a massive explosion
* II - Large star exhausts fuel, collapsing core causes massive explosion

**Key Facts:**

* Very powerful energy release
* Brighter for several weeks or months
* Can be seen millions of light years away
* Expands to hundreds of parsecs across

**Supernova Effects:**

* Creates many chemical element heavier than iron
* May have contributed elements to form the Solar System
* May influence formation of new stars","I can provide you information and assistance.
