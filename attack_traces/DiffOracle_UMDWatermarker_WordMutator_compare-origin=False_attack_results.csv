Here's a revised scenario:

As I accompanied my client, Jack, on his visit to the high-security prison facility, we passed through a series of metal detectors and security checkpoints. The grim-faced correctional officer examined every inch of clothing, scrutinizing our attire with an air of suspicion.

Jack, still adjusting to life as a convicted felon, was dressed in the standard-issue denim overall-sets provided by the institution - light blue and stained below the knees from manual labor in the yard. His hair was neatly tied to maintain institutional regulations, but he couldn't help but keep trying to pull down the drooping straps which kept threatening to expose his bright orange undershirt.

Our group leader handed the COs (Correctional Officers) at the entrance a stack of printed visitor passes. When it was their turn, one CO reached for my papers. Flicking through the pages attached with my temporary visitor badge she stopped right at my clothing inspection.

These denim jeans with copper buckle belt, plus the 16 rivets buckles were deemed perfectly innocuous for this visit.

The female CO, Maria Martinez looked up from scrutinizing these with pursed lips said “alright”. Another officer double-checked everything before giving her nod also “Clear!”","I'd be happy to incorporate those details into the story.
