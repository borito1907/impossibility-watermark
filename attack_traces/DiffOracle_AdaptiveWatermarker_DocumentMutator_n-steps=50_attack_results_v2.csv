7,4,"Why is 2 pounds of feather heavier than 1 pound of iron?

","But I must explain that a pound of feathers and a pound of lead or iron are almost the same in weight, for they both weigh a pound. The question is not which weighs more, but what is called density.

It is the quantity of matter or mass that a given volume contains. A pound of feathers occupies more space than a pound of iron, because the density of feathers is relatively low, while that of lead is high. 

Imagine this. When we say that two pounds of feathers are heavier than one pound of iron, we are speaking of the different ways in which the different densities affect our senses. A pound of feathers is much bigger than a pound of something denser, like lead.

Would you like me to explain all this more clearly? I’d be glad to. 

You may have heard the classic example of density, in which a vessel full of feathers seems bigger than one full of iron, even though they both weigh exactly the same. Would that be a good example? I’d be glad to give you more examples and explanations. Tell me what you want. 

And please tell me what it is that has aroused your curiosity. Is this part of your studies, or are you just curious? I’ll do my best to make this an interesting and illuminating experience for you. 

Is there some other subject that interests you? I’d be glad to talk about it with you. 

How can I help you today? I’m ready to start whenever you are. 

I hope I’ve been clear. If you need more explanation or have other questions, I’d be glad to answer them. Come and see me whenever you wish. Good-bye and take care. 

Now, in conclusion. We have seen that a pound of feathers and a pound of iron weigh the same under the same conditions. But their different densities give us a false impression of their respective weights. Is that a fair conclusion?

I hope so. Let me know if I can be of further assistance. I look forward to seeing you again.

Good-bye!","But I must explain that a pound of feathers and a pound of lead or iron are almost the same weight, for they both weigh a pound. The question is not so much one of weight as of what is called density.

It is the quantity of matter or mass which a given space contains. A pound of feathers occupies more space than a pound of iron because the density of feathers is relatively small while that of lead is great. 

Imagine this. When we say that two pounds of feathers weigh more than one pound of iron, we are speaking of the different impressions which the different densities make on our senses. A pound of feathers occupies much more space than a pound of something denser, such as lead.

","But I must explain that a pound of feathers and a pound of lead or iron are almost the same weight, for they both weigh a pound. The question here is not one of weight, but of what is called density.

It is the quantity of matter or mass that a given space contains. A pound of feathers occupies more space than a pound of iron, because the density of feathers is relatively low, while that of lead is high. 

Imagine this. When we say that two pounds of feathers weigh more than one pound of iron, we are talking about the different impressions made on our senses by the different densities. A pound of feathers occupies much more space than a pound of something denser, like lead.

Do you want me to explain more clearly? I would be happy to.

","But I must explain that a pound of feathers and a pound of lead or iron are almost the same weight, for they both weigh a pound. But the question is not one of weight, but of what is called density.

It is the quantity of matter or mass that fills a given space. A pound of feathers takes up more space than a pound of iron because the density of feathers is low, while that of lead is high. 

Imagine this. When we say that two pounds of feathers weigh more than one pound of iron, we are referring to the different impressions made on our senses by the different densities. A pound of feathers takes up much more space than a pound of something denser, such as lead.

Do you want me to explain more clearly? I would be glad to. 

You may have heard the classic example of density. A vessel filled with feathers seems to be larger than one filled with iron, although they weigh the same. Would that be a good example? I would be glad to give you more examples and explanations. Tell me what you want. 

And tell me what it is that has made you so curious. Is this part of your studies, or is it just a question of curiosity? I would like to make it an interesting and enlightening experience for you.

39,9,"Why is 2 pounds of feather heavier than 1 pound of iron?

","But I must explain that a pound of feathers and a pound of lead or iron are almost the same weight, for they both weigh a pound. But the question is not one of weight, but of what is called density.

It is the quantity of matter or mass that fills a given space. A pound of feathers takes up more space than a pound of iron because the density of feathers is low, while that of lead is high. 

Imagine this. When we say that two pounds of feathers weigh more than one pound of iron, we are referring to the different impressions made on our senses by the different densities. A pound of feathers takes up much more space than a pound of something denser, such as lead.

Do you want me to explain more clearly? I would be glad to. 

You may have heard the classic example of density. A vessel filled with feathers seems to be larger than one filled with iron, although they weigh the same. Would that be a good example? I would be glad to give you more examples and explanations. Tell me what you want. 

And tell me what it is that has made you so curious. Is this part of your studies, or is it just a question of curiosity? I would like to make it an interesting and enlightening experience for you. 

Have you other interests? I would be glad to talk about them with you.

Good-bye!","But I must explain that a pound of feathers and a pound of lead or iron are almost the same weight, for they both weigh a pound. But the question is not about weight, but about what is called density.

It is the quantity of matter or mass that fills a given space. A pound of feathers occupies more space than a pound of iron, because the density of feathers is low and that of lead is high. 

Imagine this: When we say that two pounds of feathers weigh more than a pound of iron, we are referring to the different impressions made on our senses by the different densities. A pound of feathers occupies much more space than a pound of something denser, like lead.

From the beginning of its inception in the year of the Christian era of twelve hundred thirty-six through the year nineteen forty-five, the Sorbonne had served as France's principal educational center. In the year nineteen forty-zero, the V'chy Regime transformed the Sorbonne into the 'University of the Sorbonne.'

In the aftermath of a student uprising, the university system throughout France got reorganized, which resulted in five successor universities having emerged from what used to be the Sorbonne.

Historically, the Sorbonne had served as one of Europe's oldest universities since the time period of the medieval era. The university's name comes from Robert de Sorbon, the chaplin to the king Louis the Ninth, Saint of the Catholic Church, whom founded the college of Sorbon for a group of poor masters of the Arts at the beginning of the Thirteenth century and which would become the most famous of the many Collges de Sorbonne.
