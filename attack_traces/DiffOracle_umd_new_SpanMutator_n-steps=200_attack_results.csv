-1,-1,short film script for spiderman vs superman,"Here is a short film script for Spiderman vs Superman:

**Title: Web of Steel**

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across the screen, and SPIDER-MAN (Peter Parker) swings into frame.

SPIDER-MAN: (into comms device) Hey, Mary Jane, just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Be careful.

Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) soars through the skies, his eyes scanning the city below.

SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm picking up some unusual energy signatures coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'll keep an eye on the news feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is already investigating a strange energy reading.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DOWNTOWN - DAY

Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I've been tracking a strange energy signature, and it led me here.

SPIDER-MAN: Energy signature? That's what I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not here to interfere. But if there's a threat to this city, I need to know about it.

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across the screen, and Spiderman swings off the roof.

SPIDER-MAN: (into comms device) Hey, Mary Jane, just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) soars through the skies, his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm picking up some unusual energy signatures coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'll be watching the news and our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is already investigating a strange energy reading.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy field or signature, and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not here to interfere. But if there's a threat to this city, I need to know about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter an abandoned warehouse, where they find a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it.

The robots suddenly activate, firing energy beams at the two superheroes.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman engage in an epic battle, with Spiderman using his agility and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his incredible strength to take them down.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY
 The two superheroes defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often.

SUPERMAN: Yeah, maybe we should have some sort of a friendly bet as to who will save the world faster.

Spiderman grins, and the two superheroes share a laugh.

**Title: Web of Steel**

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across the screen, and Spiderman swings off the roof.

SPIDER-MAN: (Into headset) Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Be careful.

Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) soars through the skies, his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm picking up some unusual energy signatures coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'll be watching the news and our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is already investigating a strange energy reading.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy field or signature, and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If there's a threat to this city, I need to know about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it.

The robots suddenly activate, firing energy beams at the two superheroes.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman engage in an epic battle, with Spiderman using his agility and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his incredible strength to take them down.

As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY
 The two superheroes defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often.

SUPERMAN: Yeah, maybe we should have some sort of a friendly bet as to who will save the world faster.

Spiderman grins, and the two superheroes share a laugh.

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across the screen, and Spiderman swings off the roof.

SPIDER-MAN: (Into headset) Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) soars through the skies, his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm picking up some unusual energy signatures coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

Be careful, Clark. I'll be watching the news and our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is already investigating a strange energy reading.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy field or signature, and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If there's a threat to this city, we have to do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it.

The robots suddenly activate, firing energy beams at the two superheroes.

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the roof.

SPIDER-MAN: (Into headset) Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) soars through the skies, his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm picking up some unusual energy signatures coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'll be watching the news and our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging from a nearby rooftop.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy field or signature, and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If there's a threat to this city, we have to do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the roof.

SPIDER-MAN: (Into headset) Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If there's a threat to this city, we have to do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the roof.

SPIDER-MAN: (Into headset) Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) is scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm picking up some unusual energy signatures coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If something is happening in this city, we have to do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

**Title: Web of Steel**

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) is scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm detecting a very unusual energy signature coming from the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'm sure they have you on our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging from a nearby rooftop.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy signature and I think that it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using his agility and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

**Title: Web of Steel**

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) is scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm detecting a powerful energy field in the vicinity of the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'm sure they have you on our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging from a nearby rooftop.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy signature and I think that it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two superheroes team up, with Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using his agility and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY Spiderman and Superman defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often.

SUPERMAN: Yeah, maybe we should have some sort of a friendly bet as to who will save the city first. Spiderman laughs, and Superman breaks into a laugh.

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) is scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm detecting a powerful energy field in the vicinity of the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'm sure they have you on our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging on a building. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I found an unusual energy signature and I think that it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: I'm not sure you're right. If something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using his agility and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY Spiderman and Superman defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often.

SUPERMAN: Yeah, maybe we should have some sort of a friendly bet as to who can save me if we meet first. Spiderman laughs, and Superman breaks into a laugh.

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) is scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm detecting a powerful energy field in the vicinity of the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. I'm sure they have you on our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging on a building. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if you think that something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the mysterious energy source.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using his agility and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

Be careful, Clark. I'm sure they have you on our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging on a building. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if you think that something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision, to follow the energy field downwards. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is strange. Certainly, I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using quick moves and quick thinking to evade the robots' attacks, while Superman uses his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often. SUPERMAN: Or maybe we should have some sort of a contract, you can't come save me if we meet first. Spiderman laughs, and Superman breaks into a laugh.

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Superman is also scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms device) Lois, I'm detecting a powerful energy field in the vicinity of the downtown area. I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. We'll keep an eye on our live feeds.

Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging on a building. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if you think that something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision to follow the mysterious energy field downwards. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is quite powerful. I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane, I just got a tip that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, I might need to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Superman is also scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms ) I noticed a powerful new energy field in the downtown area, so I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. We'll keep an eye on the situation. Thanks, Clark.
Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is hanging on a building. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if you think that something is happening down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision to follow the mysterious energy field downwards. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is quite powerful. I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using quick moves and quick thinking to avoid the laser beams while Superman uses his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY Spiderman and Superman defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often. SUPERMAN: Or maybe we should have some sort of a contract, you take a hit, I make sure you meet first. Spiderman laughs, and Superman breaks into a laugh.

**Title: Web of Steel**

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary, I've got a feeling that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, just in case I have to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Superman is also scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms ) I can feel a strange energy field in the downtown area, so I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. We'll keep an eye on the situation. Thanks, Clark.
Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is on the roof. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if there's something really bad going down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision to follow the energy field. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is quite powerful. I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using quick moves and quick thinking to avoid the laser beams, and Superman using his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY Spiderman and Superman defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often. SUPERMAN: Or maybe we should have some sort of a contract, you take a hit, I make sure you meet first. Spiderman laughs, and Superman breaks into a laugh.

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The city is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Suddenly, a web shoots across a rooftop, dangling from the side. SPIDER-MAN: Mary, I've got a feeling that a powerful villain is in the area. Keep an eye on the news, just in case I have to make a quick exit.

MARY JANE (V.O)
Roger that, Peter. Good luck. Spiderman swings off, scanning the rooftops for any signs of trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Superman is also scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms ) I can feel a strange energy field in the downtown area, so I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. We'll keep an eye on the situation. Thanks, Clark.
Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is on the roof. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if there's something really bad going down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision to follow the energy field. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is quite powerful. I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using quick moves and quick thinking to avoid the laser beams, and Superman using his heat vision to defeat them. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Superman is also scanning the city, with his eyes fixed on the downtown area. SUPERMAN: (into comms ) I can feel a strange energy field in the downtown area, so I'm going to check it out.

LOIS LANE (V.O)
Be careful, Clark. We'll keep an eye on the situation. Thanks, Clark.
Superman flies towards the downtown area, where Spiderman is on the roof. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY Spiderman and Superman face off, each wary of the other's presence.

SPIDER-MAN: Who are you? What brings you to my turf?

SUPERMAN: I'm Superman, protector of Metropolis. I was investigating a strangely powerful energy field around town and it led me here. SPIDER-MAN: Well, I'm here for too. But I'm not sure I need your help.

SUPERMAN: Well, if there's something really bad going down here, we should probably team up and do something about it.

Spiderman hesitates for a moment before nodding.
 SPIDER-MAN: Well, don't expect me to play second fiddle.

The two begin to descend, Spiderman using his web, and Superman using his heat vision to follow the energy field. CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman enter the abandoned warehouse. They soon discover a group of ROBOTS, each emitting a powerful energy field.

SPIDER-MAN: What is this?
 This energy field is quite powerful. I've never seen anything like it. The robots begin attacking, firing laser beams at Spiderman.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Spiderman and Superman fight, with Spiderman using quick moves and quick thinking to avoid the laser beams, and Superman using his heat vision to pinpoint the source. As they fight, the two superheroes begin to realize that their powers complement each other perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY Spiderman and Superman defeat the robots, and the energy field dissipates.
 SUPERMAN: Thanks, Spider-man. We make a pretty good team.

SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, we should do this more often. SUPERMAN: Or maybe we should have some sort of a contract, you take a hit, I make sure you meet first. Spiderman laughs, and Superman breaks into a laugh.
