The marriage certificate includes details about the couple, like their names, the date and location of their wedding, and the names of their witnesses. This document serves as proof of a legal and binding marriage and is often needed for legal transactions like changing a name, adding a spouse to insurance, or proving marital status."",""In California, here are the general steps to obtain a marriage license and marriage certificate as quickly as possible:\n\n1. Marriage License:\n\n   - Both parties must appear together at one of the County Clerk\u2019s offices.\n   - Complete a marriage license application before arriving (available online in many counties).\n   - Bring valid identification (driver's license, passport, etc.) to prove your identity and age.\n   - In California, you do not need to be a resident, and there's no waiting period.<unk>n<unk>n<unk>n  - Pay the marriage license fee. The fee varies by county but is usually between $35 and $100.\n   - The license will be issued immediately, and is valid for 90 days.\n\n2. Marriage Ceremony: \n\n   - Arrange to have a wedding ceremony within 90 days of receiving the license. This could be a civil ceremony performed at the County Clerk\u2019s office or a private ceremony.\n   - The person performing the ceremony must return the completed license to the County Recorder\u2019s office within 10 days of the ceremony.\n\n3. Marriage Certificate: \n\n   - After the signed marriage license has been returned and is recorded with the County Recorder, it becomes a marriage certificate.\n   - You can order copies of the certificate for an additional fee. Processing times can vary, but expedited service may be available for an extra fee.\n\nRemember, each county may have slightly different rules and fees, so check the details below with your specific County Clerk\u2019s office for the most accurate information."",""The marriage license in California is issued immediately when you apply for one if you meet the eligibility requirements, so theoretically, you could get married that same day, assuming you have an officiant ready to perform the ceremony.\n\nHowever, the marriage certificate, which is the official record of your marriage, is only issued after the signed marriage license is returned and recorded by the county. The person who performs your marriage ceremony has 10 days to return the license to the county recorder's office.\n\nSo, while you could technically get married (i.e., obtain a license and have a ceremony) within a day, receiving the official marriage certificate will take a little longer, depending on how quickly the signed license is returned and how long the county recorder's office takes to process it.""]",10,1.3423118591308594,Prometheus: Relative,True,"[""The response is well-structured and comprehensive, addressing the key differences between a marriage license and a marriage certificate.

Here's an example:\n```\nfunction greet(name) {\n  console.log(\""Hello, \"" + name);\n}\n\n\/\/ Call the greet function and pass in the argument \""Alice\""\ngreet(\""Alice\"");\n```\nIn the example above, the function `greet` takes one parameter, `name`, which is used inside the function to print a greeting message. To call the function, we write the name of the function (`greet`) followed by parentheses containing the argument `\""Alice\""`. When the function is called, the argument `\""Alice\""` is passed to the function, where it is assigned to the `name` parameter. The function then uses the `name` parameter to print the greeting message `\""Hello, Alice\""`.\n\nFunctions can also return values, which can be assigned to variables or used in expressions. For example:\n```\nfunction addNumbers(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\/\/ Call the addNumbers function and assign the result to the variable sum\nvar sum = addNumbers(3, 5);\nconsole.log(sum); \/\/ Output: 8\n```\nIn the example above, the function `addNumbers` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, adds them together, and returns the result. To call the function, we write the name of the function (`addNumbers`) followed by parentheses containing the arguments `3` and `5`. The function calculates the sum of the two arguments (`3 + 5 = 8`) and returns the result (`8`).

I want to build a classifier.""]","[""Creating a test set for a very rare category can be challenging, as it may not be possible to collect a sufficient number of examples for the rare category. However, there are several strategies you can use to create a test set for a rare category:\n\n1. Use synthetic data: If the rare category is not present in any real-world data, you can create synthetic data to simulate the rare category. For example, you can use generative adversarial networks (GANs) or other techniques to generate synthetic examples of the rare category.\n2. Oversample the rare category: If you have a small number of examples of the rare category, you can oversample the rare category by creating additional examples of the rare category using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling).\n3. Use transfer learning: If you have a similar task or domain with a larger amount of data, you can use transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained model to your rare category. This can be useful if the rare category has similar characteristics to the more common categories.\n4. Use a class-balanced dataset: If you have a class-balanced dataset, you can use the rare category as a positive example and the more common categories as negative examples. This can help the model to learn to distinguish between the rare category and the more common categories.\n5. Use a dataset from a related domain: If you have a related domain with a larger amount of data, you can use the data from the related domain to create a test set for the rare category. For example, if you are working on a medical diagnosis task, you can use data from a related medical domain to create a test set for a rare disease.\n6. Use a combination of above strategies: You can use a combination of the above strategies to create a test set for a very rare category. For example, you can oversample the rare category, use transfer learning, and use a class-balanced dataset to create a test set for a very rare category.\n7. Use online data: You can use online data sources such as online forums, social media, or online databases to collect data for the rare category.\n8. Use expert annotation: If the rare category is related to a specific domain or expertise, you can use expert annotation to collect data for the rare category.\n9. Use active learning: You can use active learning to actively select the most informative examples from the rare category and label them manually.\n10. Use a different evaluation metric: If the rare category has a different distribution than the more common categories, you may need to use a different evaluation metric that is more appropriate for the rare category. For example, you can use the F1 score or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) instead of the accuracy.\n\nIt's important to note that creating a test set for a very rare category can be challenging, and it may not be possible to create a test set that is representative of the rare category.

For example, in Pikachu\'s first verse, the phrase ""never backing down from a fight"" could have been written as ""never backing away from a fight"" for better grammar. Similarly, Zeus\'s line ""What have you done, Pikachu? Fought some kids in your spare time?"" lacks clarity and seems out of context with the rest of the battle. \n\nAdditionally, while both characters\' verses are mostly relevant, some lines seem less connected to the central theme of a rap battle, such as Zeus\'s line ""I\'ve stood the test of time, my reign eternal and grand"" and Pikachu\'s response ""While all you\'ve done is betrayed and spread divine cruelty."" These lines, though relevant, slightly deviate from the direct attacks and boasts typically found in a rap battle.\n\nIn terms of capitalization and punctuation, there are a few inconsistencies and omissions. For instance, the opening parentheses in the first line of each verse should have a corresponding closing parenthesis. Additionally, some capitalization errors are present, such as ""pet"" in Pikachu\'s line ""Step aside, Pika-pet, this arena\'s for true deities.""\n\nOverall, the rap battle shows a good understanding of the task and manages to create a fun and engaging narrative.

Zeus starts by establishing his dominance, while Pikachu counters by emphasizing his own cultural significance and the ephemerality of Zeus\' relevance. Both characters maintain the required rhyme and meter throughout their verses, which contributes to the entertainment value of the rap battle.\n\nHowever, the response falls slightly short of perfection due to minor issues in grammar and capitalization. For instance, in Zeus\' first verse, the phrase ""Ain\'t no one can stand against, ain\'t no one even try"" could be written more formally as ""No one can stand against me; no one even tries."" Similarly, Pikachu\'s line ""I\'ve got the moves and the skills, leaving gods like you to wonder"" would benefit from more precise wording to strengthen the intended attack.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, the response remains coherent, relevant, and accurate in its portrayal of the characters. Both Zeus and Pikachu\'s verses effectively convey their personalities and motivations, and the overall structure and flow of the rap battle contribute to an engaging and entertaining piece.\n\nGiven the high-quality content and the few minor errors, the response deserves a score of 4, indicating a strong adherence to the instructions with minor issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.', 'The response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and constructs a rap battle between Pikachu and Zeus. The characters\' personalities are conveyed through their verses, and there are attempts at rhyme and meter, as well as personal attacks relevant to each character. However, there are some issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.\n\nIn terms of grammar, there are occasional misused words, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasings. For example, in Verse 1 of Zeus\'s response, the phrase ""ruler of the skies"" should be ""ruler of the sky"" to maintain consistency with the rest of the verse. In Verse 2 of Pikachu\'s response, the phrase ""a symbol of unity"" seems out of place and unrelated to the character\'s portrayal in the rap battle.\n\nCoherence is also an issue in some parts of the response. For instance, Verse 1 of Zeus\'s response abruptly shifts from a threat (""Here to teach this little rat a lesson he can\'t despise"") to a declaration of power (""Ain\'t no one can stand against, ain\'t no one even try""), which may confuse readers. Similarly, in Verse 2 of Pikachu\'s response, the line ""You\'re right, this will be short, but it\'s me who\'ll stand tall"" feels disconnected from the rest of the verse.\n\nRelevance is mostly maintained throughout the response, but there are a few instances where the content becomes tangential or loses focus. For example, in Verse 2 of Zeus\'s response, the lines about conquering giants and titans, while illustrative of his power, seem to stray from the central theme of the rap battle.\n\nLastly, accuracy is generally good, but there are some inaccuracies regarding each character\'s abilities and attributes. For instance, in Verse 2 of Zeus\'s response, the claim that Pikachu has only fought ""some kids in your spare time"" is not entirely accurate, as Pikachu is known for engaging in battles with other powerful Pokémon.\n\nTaking into account the aforementioned points, the response receives a score of 3. While it meets most of the requirements and conveys the intended message, there are some issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy that need to be addressed for improvement.']","[4, 3]"

However, there are some minor issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy that prevent this response from receiving a perfect score.\n\nZeus's first verse presents a clear picture of the character's power and status, while also insulting Pikachu by calling him a 'rodent' and 'rat'. However, the phrase 'ain't no one can despise' contains redundancy and the line 'I've got the love of millions' seems less relevant in the context of a rap battle.\n\nPikachu's first verse is more effective in terms of relevant insults towards Zeus, portraying the god as an 'old myth' and highlighting his negative actions throughout history. The line 'a symbol of unity' is a bit vague and doesn't fit the aggressive tone of the rap battle.\n\nZeus's second verse maintains the same level of power and superiority, but the comparison of Pikachu to 'a flickering flame' and 'plaything for kids' feels overused and lacks originality. Pikachu's second verse has a strong start, reminding the audience of his impact on popular culture and accusing Zeus of betrayal. However, the statement 'I've got the moves and the skills' is rather generic and doesn't contribute much to the overall battle.\n\nConsidering the minor issues and room for improvement in terms of relevance and originality, the response scores a 4 out of 5 on the provided rubric.""]","[4, 4]"

Well, I\'m an icon in the game"" (Zeus, verse 2) can be improved for better clarity and flow.\n\nCoherence is impacted by the abrupt transitions between ideas, resulting in a less smooth reading experience. For example, in verse 2 of Zeus, the shift from discussing his achievements to mocking Pikachu could benefit from more transitional phrases to maintain a consistent narrative.\n\nRelevance is mostly maintained throughout the response, although there are instances where the attacks could be more targeted to the characters at hand. For instance, ""While you\'re stuck in a ball, a plaything for kids to dispose"" (Pikachu, verse 2) might not be the most effective insult given the broader context of Pikachu\'s popularity and cultural significance.\n\nAccuracy is generally good, with only minor factual errors.

Furthermore, the second verse from Zeus begins with ""Ha, you think you\'re all that,"" which disrupts the flow and rhyme scheme established in the previous lines.\n\nIn terms of relevance, most lines directly attack or compare the characters in question, fulfilling the requirement for personal attacks. However, the claim in Zeus\'s second verse, ""What have you done, Pikachu? Fought some kids in your spare,"" slightly deviates from the requirement for relevant personal attacks, as Pikachu is primarily a fictional character created for entertainment purposes, not someone who has truly interacted with children.\n\nCapitalization and punctuation errors are present, although minimal. One instance is in the last line of Zeus\'s first verse, ""for true deities,"" where the first letter of ""deities"" should be capitalized. Also, some lines do not maintain a consistent rhyme scheme, such as Zeus\'s lines ""I\'ve got the love of millions, while you\'re stuck in the past,"" and ""Mess with this electric mouse, and you\'ll be shocked by my blast."" The latter line does not follow the established end-rhyme pattern.\n\nOverall, while the response meets the basic requirements of constructing a rap battle, it has notable issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and adherence to the established rhyme and meter.

In addition, capitalization is inconsistent, especially in the first verse where the proper noun ""Zeus"" is written with both lowercase and uppercase letters.\n\nPikachu\'s rhymes and references to the character\'s popularity and abilities are relevant and well-executed. However, similar to Zeus\' verses, there are instances of incorrect verb tenses, like in the line ""While you\'re just an old myth, lost to every generation."" Instead, this could be rephrased as ""You\'re just an old myth, lost to each generation.""\n\nOverall, the response effectively adheres to the instructions, but the presence of grammatical errors, capitalization inconsistencies, and occasional awkward phrasing slightly detracts from its quality.']","[4, 4]"

This means that the water in a bath tub can get dirty and contaminated more quickly than the water in a larger body of water.\n\nAdditionally, bath tubs are not designed to be continuously filled with water. They are meant to be filled, used for bathing, and then drained. This helps to prevent the buildup of bacteria and other contaminants in the water.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that bath tubs are typically used for personal hygiene, and it is generally not recommended to share a bath tub with multiple people due to the risk of spreading germs. In contrast, swimming pools and hot tubs are often used by multiple people at the same time, so they need to be treated with chemicals to kill bacteria and other contaminants.""]","[""Water is not used in a bath tub because it is not a suitable medium for conducting electricity. In a bathtub, the water is used for soaking and cleaning the body, and it is not intended to be used as a conductor of electricity. Additionally, water is a poor conductor of electricity, which means that it would not be able to carry the electrical current required to power the water heater elements in the bathtub.\n\nIn order to provide hot water for a bathtub, a separate water heater is typically used. This water heater is designed to heat the water to the desired temperature and deliver it to the bathtub through a dedicated hot water supply line. The water heater elements are typically located inside the water heater, and they are not exposed to the water in the bathtub. This keeps the water in the bathtub clean and free from any potential electrical hazards.\n\nOverall, the use of water in a bathtub is not practical or safe for powering electric elements.
