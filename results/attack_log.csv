    Captain marvel trailer breakdown:

    The Captain Marvel trailer shows us a mix of action, humor, and emotional moments, giving us a glimpse into the life of Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), aka Captain Marvel. Here's a breakdown of what we see in the trailer:

        * We then cut to Carol in her suit, looking fierce and ready for battle.
        * Next, we see Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) without his iconic eye patch, which suggests this might be before he lost his eye.
        * The trailer cuts to a montage of action sequences, showing Carol fighting Kree warriors and destroying enemy ships."",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
