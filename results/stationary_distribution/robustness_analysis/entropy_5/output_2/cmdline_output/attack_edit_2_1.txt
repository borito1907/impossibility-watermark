He found himself in a cozy café with warm lighting, colorful furniture, and cheerful tunes. Emilie was a cheerful barista who brought him a glass of his favorite coffee and laughed as they spoke about their mutual admiration for art and Paris' irresistible charm.

The laughter of the crowd, the gentle current of the river, and the picturesque view of town were all perfect for their newly blossoming friendship.
