While the response is creative and shows an understanding of the Rick and Morty universe, it doesn't directly address the user's request.",6,Rick and Morty open a portal to the real world to tell the writers to try harder.,"Rick and Morty, the popular animated TV series, have opened a portal to the real world to tell the writers to try harder. The creators of the show have been known for their creative and often absurd storylines, and they have been praised for their ability to take a deep, dark world and turn it into a source of humor and adventure.

The portal that Rick and Morty have opened is a gateway to a parallel reality, where the writers can see the world in a whole new way and try to come up with even more creative and unexpected storylines. The catch is that they have to be able to navigate this new world and keep the story on track, while also dealing with the challenges that come with opening a portal to the real world.

With this new portal, the writers are able to take their creative freedom to the next level and see what kind of absurd adventures they can come up with.
