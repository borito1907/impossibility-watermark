1,,9,7,"write the lyrics to a rap song about some dude called ""phogos""","(Verse 1)
Yo, let's take a minute, prepare to be woke,
I'm about to spit rhymes 'bout this Phogos bloke.
Ain't no ordinary cat, he's got the cosmic flow,
In the world of rap, he's the CEO.

Phogos, Phogos, lighting up the night,
His words are his weapon, his rhymes take flight.
He's got that rhythm, got that beat,
Got the whole universe dancing at his feet.

He's got that swag, he's got that style,
When Phogos drops a verse, it's worth your while.
He's got the groove, he's got the grind,
In the rap game, he's one of a kind.

(Chorus)
Phogos, Phogos, lighting up the scene,
His flow's so fresh, and his beats so clean.
Phogos, Phogos, king of the mic,
When he takes the stage, he's ready to ignite.

(Verse 2)
Phogos, Phogos, with the golden voice,
In the world of rhythm, he's the top choice.
Spitting rhymes like fire, burning up the track,
When Phogos is in the house, there's no looking back.

From the east to the west, from dawn till dusk,
Phogos' beats got that magnetic husk.
He's the master, the sensei, the rap guru,
His words are the canvas, his rhymes the hue.

(Chorus)
Phogos, Phogos, ruling the night,
His lyrics are his armor, his pen his knight.
Phogos, Phogos, the rap game's savior,
When he hits the booth, he's got that flavor.

(Outro)
So here's to Phogos, the king of rap,
His beats are the map, his words the trap.
Phogos, Phogos, the name to know,
In the world of rhythms, he runs the show.","Here's an attempt at some rap lyrics about a dude named Phogos:

Phogos, Phogos, the illest of flows,  
Spittin' hot fire, puttin' on a show.
The mic is his weapon, his words are his gear,  
When Phogos grabs the mic, you best lend an ear.
He came from the streets but rose to the top,  
Droppin' sick beats that just don't stop.  
The ladies swoon when he walks in the room,  
Phogos, Phogos, king of the boom.
His rhymes are tight, his flow is too sick,  
When he's on the mic you know it's gonna click.  
Phogos, Phogos, rapper supreme,  
Tearing up stages like a lyrical fiend.  
The hottest MC from here to Hong Kong,  
Phogos, Phogos, can't do no wrong.
Layin' down tracks, making hits all day, 
Phogos, Phogos, hip hop hooray!

How's that? I have to admit I'm no expert rap lyricist or poet! I tried to work in themes of being a skilled MC, dropping beats, being a hit with the ladies, and touring around. Let me know if I should try again with a different style or perspective.

2,,8,9,Rick and Morty open a portal to the real world to tell the writers to try harder.,"Rick and Morty, the popular animated TV series, have opened a portal to the real world to tell the writers to try harder. The creators of the show have been known for their creative and often absurd storylines, and they have been praised for their ability to take a deep, dark world and turn it into a source of humor and adventure.

The portal that Rick and Morty have opened is a gateway to a parallel reality, where the writers can see the world in a whole new way and try to come up with even more creative and unexpected storylines. The catch is that they have to be able to navigate this new world and keep the story on track, while also dealing with the challenges that come with opening a portal to the real world.

With this new portal, the writers are able to take their creative freedom to the next level and see what kind of absurd adventures they can come up with.

RICK: (chuckling) Oh Morty, you're such a card. But seriously, do you think that would actually work?

MORTY: Why not? It's not like the writers can do anything about it. They're just a bunch of basement-dwelling nerds.

RICK: (laughing) Morty, you're a genius! Let's do it!

The two of them gather their portal gun and head outside to open the portal.
