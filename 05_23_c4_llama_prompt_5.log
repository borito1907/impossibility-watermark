[2024-05-23 12:45:35,083][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), closing out a floor debate over spending priorities and opening a new front on the midterm campaign trail.
As expected, no Democrats voted for the blueprint from Ryan. The former Republican vice presidential nominee's plan returns to ideas that have come to define the GOP, including ending federal deficits by cutting taxes on the rich, revamping Medicare and slashing almost every other aspect of government.
In a vote of 219-205, House Republicans showed an unusual display of cohesion, as they have for the last four years on Ryan's proposals, presenting voters with a unified snapshot of GOP priorities.
"This document is our vision for getting Americans back to work and our budget back in balance," said House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).
Democrats swiftly showed how they would use the vote as campaign fodder in the coming midterm elections to portray the GOP as out-of-step with most Americans.
"This House Republican budget is the worst I have ever seen," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the budget committee, to applause on the House floor. "At every juncture in this House Republican budget, they choose to protect very powerful special interests and the most wealthy in the country at the expense of everybody else."
Like President Obama's budget earlier this year, the GOP document is not expected to be adopted. Congress has already agreed to spending for this fiscal year and next under a previous agreement.
Ryan's proposal would overhaul Medicare for the next generation of seniors, boost defense spending beyond Obama's levels and slash most other domestic spending on college aid, food stamps and basic government investments. Tax rates for the wealthy would be cut to a top rate of 25%.
Twelve Republicans broke from the party to oppose the budget, many of them seeking deeper reductions than Ryan proposed. Even though Ryan's budget would repeal Obamacare, he relied on the taxes and savings in the healthcare law to reduce deficits.
Obama's budget, by contrast, would continue deficit spending for the next 10 years, raise taxes on the wealthiest 3% of households and fund priority programs, including expanded investments in education and infrastructure.
But in a sign of how difficult budget issues remain for lawmakers, a Democratic proposal that largely mirrored the president's approach was put to a vote Thursday and 31 Democrats opposed it.

Ryan Plan: How It Would Affect Medicare, Medicaid and Other Programs (USA Today)
...The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the Ryan plan would reduce federal spending by $5.3 trillion over 10 years, with much of those savings coming from changes to health care programs.
Here are some key provisions:
*Medicare: For people who turn 65 in 2022 or later, the plan would replace the current fee-for-service system with vouchers to purchase private insurance plans...
*Medicaid: The plan would convert the joint federal-state program into block grants to states, giving them more flexibility to design their own systems...
*Food Stamps: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would be converted into block grants to states, similar to Medicaid...
*Pell Grants: The maximum Pell Grant award would be frozen at the current level of $5,550, rather than increasing as scheduled...
*Deductibles and Co-Pays: In an effort to increase cost-sharing and reduce costs, the plan would increase deductibles and co-pays for many beneficiaries under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs...
Healthcare Experts Weigh in on Paul Ryan’s Budget Proposal (NPR)
...Some health policy experts say the voucher idea could work if properly structured, but others worry it would lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for seniors and the disabled...
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a healthcare expert and former White House adviser, says Ryan's approach is flawed because it fails to address the underlying drivers of healthcare inflation. "

[2024-05-23 12:58:10,059][watermarker][INFO] - Received completion: WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that would shrink the federal deficit by cutting domestic spending and reshaping entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The vote was  to. 
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) praised the measure, saying it would help create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

"It's time for us to take our responsibility, lead and show the American people we're serious about dealing with this debt crisis," Boehner said on the floor.

Democrats opposed the plan, calling it unfair because it slashes funding for popular social programs while maintaining tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.

"Ryan's budget is a roadmap to nowhere," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), ranking member of the Budget Committee. "It fails to address our nation's most pressing problems."

The Ryan proposal also faces opposition in the Senate, where Democrats hold a majority, making it unlikely to become law anytime soon.

Still, Republicans touted the plan as a necessary step towards reducing the country's $14 trillion national debt and averting an unprecedented credit downgrade.

"We must take action to ensure the long-term stability of our nation's finances," said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.).

[2024-05-23 12:58:10,244][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that would shrink the federal deficit by cutting domestic spending and reshaping entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The vote was  to. 
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) praised the measure, saying it would help create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

"It's time for us to take our responsibility, lead and show the American people we're serious about dealing with this debt crisis," Boehner said on the floor.

Democrats opposed the plan, calling it unfair because it slashes funding for popular social programs while maintaining tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.

"Ryan's budget is a roadmap to nowhere," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), ranking member of the Budget Committee. "It fails to address our nation's most pressing problems."

The Ryan proposal also faces opposition in the Senate, where Democrats hold a majority, making it unlikely to become law anytime soon.

Still, Republicans touted the plan as a necessary step towards reducing the country's $14 trillion national debt and averting an unprecedented credit downgrade.

"We must take action to ensure the long-term stability of our nation's finances," said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.).
