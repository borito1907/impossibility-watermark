# TODO: What does sp stand for?
# Answer: sp is short for semantic space partitioning. Leaving the TODO up in case we still want to rename the variable.
# This variable corresponds to both sp_mode (in sampling.py) and detection_mode (in detection.py) in their code.
# We might want to rename it.
sp_mode: lsh # or kmeans
sp_dim: 3
lmbd: .25
max_new_tokens: 205 # maximum number of tokens to generate
min_new_tokens: 195 # minimum number of tokens to generate
