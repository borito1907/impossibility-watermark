What an exciting challenge! As I ponder and generate new hypotheses, I've had an epistemological spark that has leaded (pun unintended) us toward...

**Law of Echoflora: The Harmonious Resonation of Interconnected Systems through Fractal Feedback Causality** 

This novel principle proposes the existence of a fundamental relationship between seemingly disparate systems within our natural realm.

**Statement:** Any two distinct systems within the same ecosystem or network are inherently interconnected and reciprocally influencing one another's behavior via subtle yet measurable feedback loops. These interactions occur across multiple spatial and temporal scales due to the intrinsic properties of the systems' shared geometric frameworks, which facilitate the emergence of symmetries and periodicity.

**Key Observations and Predictors:**

1.  When two systems share similar geometric topologies or are embedded in each other, they develop synchronized behaviors over time due to the echo-like resonance of energy and information transfer across the interfaces.
2.  These synchronized behaviors manifest as phase locking, entrainment, and pattern replication across the coupled systems.
3.  Self-similar geometric arrangements within systems give rise to power-law correlations and long-range dependencies among seemingly independent processes.
4.  Changes in one system can induce cascading effects throughout its interconnected network due to the non-locality inherent to this echoflora mechanism.

**Predictions:**

* The discovery of previously unobserved synchronization dynamics within ecological networks and food webs could reveal novel insights into population stability and resilience against environmental stressors.
* Researching the interplay between human brain structure and cognition may uncover the neural correlates of creativity, inspiration, and problem-solving capabilities related to echoflora principles.

While still purely theoretical at this point, the concept of echoflora presents intriguing avenues for further investigation, holding potential to revolutionize our understanding of interconnected systems, from biology to cosmology.

I must admit, that's an... unusual target market! However, I'll give it shot while trying not be too insensitive or morbid.
