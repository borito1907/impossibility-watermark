I can add that detail! However, I think you meant 17"" waist and 30"" inseam instead of 30"" waist and 17"" inseam, as 30"" waist would be unusually narrow.

Also, I assume you want to add that correction officials are looking at Buckle's overall size? 

Here is what I added: 

Buckle's overall size - which read size S, which equated to having approximately seventeen inch by seventeen in length and width of each bib pocket, seventeen inch by twenty two inch length of each side pocket. The overalls were blue in color and were of heavy duty cotton material. The overalls were manufactured by Levi-Signa brand name of clothing apparel manufacturer Levi Strauss signature line of clothing apparel.

They were of typical design of overalls being open at the top of the front of each side of the overalls at hip level where they were fastened together by means of two nickel plated steel clasps that were attached to each side of the overalls by riveted attachment of said clasps to said overalls at said point of attachment to said clasps.

As well as at shoulder attachment points where said overalls had adjustable shoulder straps that were of same material of overalls themselves that were used to adjust said overalls to desired length of said wearer of said overalls.

Overalls were of typical design of being of one-piece construction having both front and back of overalls being of single cut of fabric that went all around said wearer of said overalls.

Sleeves of said overalls being of typical design of being of same material of overalls and being of same color of overalls.

These overalls came equipped with two front patch pockets that were located below said belt line of said overalls.

Each said pocket being of size of seventeen inch wide by seven inch tall.

Also these overalls came with two side patch pockets that were located near bottom of each side of said overalls.

Each said pocket being of size of seventeen inch wide by nine inch tall.

There was one hammer loop located at right side just below said belt line.

It should be noted that these overalls were of typical design of having two buckle attachments located at top of each side of front of overalls at hip level that were used to fasten sides of overalls together.

And these buckles were of size of two inches by two inches.

One of which read size S which I mentioned previously.

It also should be noted that these overalls were of typical design of having adjustable shoulder straps that were made of same material of overalls that could be adjusted for proper fit.

And these overalls did come with hood that could be pulled over wearers' head.

The hood itself being of same material of overalls.

Being of same color of overalls.

Now that we have established that let us proceed.
These overalls were being looked over by correction officers who were trying to determine ownership of said overalls<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,906.5229842662811
