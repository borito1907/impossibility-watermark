143,"Here's a brief comparison of the historical performance of each factor:

**Market (MKT)**:
	* Average annual return: around 7-8% (depending on the specific market index used)
	* Volatility: relatively high, with standard deviations ranging from 15% to 20%
	* Performance: Generally positive, but can be negative during market downturns

**Size (SMB)**:
	* Average annual return: around 2-3% (small-caps tend to outperform large-caps over the long term)
	* Volatility: relatively high, with standard deviations ranging from 10% to 15%
	* Performance: Historically, small-caps have outperformed large-caps, especially during economic recoveries

**Value (HML)**:
	* Average annual return: around 4-5% (high book-to-market stocks tend to outperform low book-to-market stocks)
	* Volatility: relatively moderate, with standard deviations ranging from 8% to 12%
	* Performance: Historically, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks, especially during periods of market distress

**Profitability (RMW)**:
	* Average annual return: around 1-2% (high-profitability stocks tend to outperform low-profitability stocks)
	* Volatility: relatively low, with standard deviations ranging from 5% to 8%
	* Performance: Historically, profitable companies have tended to outperform unprofitable ones, especially during periods of economic expansion

**Investment (CMA)**:
	* Average annual return: around 1-2% (low-investment stocks tend to outperform high-investment stocks)
	* Volatility: relatively moderate, with standard deviations ranging from 6% to 10%
	* Performance: Historically, companies with low investments have tended to outperform those with high investments, especially during periods of economic slowdown
