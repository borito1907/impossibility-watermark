Yo, I'm Siggy F, the OG of the game,

The unconscious mind, that's where it's at,
Repressed thoughts and desires,'that,
Oedipus complexes, Id, Ego, Superego too,
My concepts still relevant, while yours is just new,

Schmiegel, your pill might mask the pain,
But it won't cure the root, only sustain,
A Band-Aid fix for a society in need,
Of true introspection, not just a chemical deed.

The Id, Ego, Superego, no one could endorse,
Your Prozac may mask the symptoms for now,
But it's just a bandaid,'my theories take them down,

In dreams and slips of tongue, I see the psyche unfold,
