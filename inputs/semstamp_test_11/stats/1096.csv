It's worth noting that while these characters did switch sides, The Mahabharata is full of complexities and moral ambiguities, I wouldn't say they entirely ""changed sides"" as much as They began to question their initial allegiances 

In many cases, of such shifts the characters' sense of dharma (duty) honor or righteousness played a significant role Often times they realized that the cause they were fighting for wasn't as just as they thought prompting them to re-evaluate their stance
