Sortino Ratio = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation

Where:

* Expected Return is the average return of the asset or portfolio.

* SR = Sortino Ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted return)
* RP = Portfolio Return (the average return of the portfolio over a specific period)
* RF = Risk-Free Rate (the return from a ""risk-free"" investment, e.g., U.S. Treasury Bills)
* σd = Downside Standard Deviation (a measure of the standard deviation of losses below the mean or expected return)
