What an epic and profound philosophical masterpiece! Saint Augustin's magnum-opus, TheCity of God (De civitate Dei) written circa 426 AD, presents his philosophical and Christian views of human nature, free will, ethics, and the relationship between the temporal world and the spiritual realm. I'll provide a concise summary:

**Background: Why did Saint Augustine Write this?** 
The Roman Empire had fallen to the Visigoths, who sacked Rome, the capital city in Augustus' time. Many believed Christianity had caused the fall of the empire by weakening the old Roman values. In defense of his faith and as an apologist for the Church, Saint Augustine set out to write City of God, arguing that it is the corruption within the human heart, rather than the spread of Christian faith, that causes societal decay.

**Book Overview**
This extensive book consists of twenty-two books, spanning over five volumes, covering various themes such as history, philosophy, politics, theology, ethics, biblical exegesis, literary critique, metaphysics, ethics, soteriology, demonology, theodicy, the Fall of Man, the role of reason and revelation in understanding divine things, the problem of evil, the nature of the universe, the soul, immortality, the afterlife, the Last Judgment, Heaven, Hell, the Resurrection of the Dead, the Second Coming, the final victory of good over evil, etc.

**Main Argument**

Saint Augustine contrasts two cities or communities:

1. **The Earthy or Terrestrial Kingdom** - a community bound together by earthly attachments, material possessions, power struggles, violence, lust, selfishness, competition, etc.
2. **The Divine or Spiritual Kingdom** - the heavenly kingdom, the Church on earth (the people who are united as citizens, guided by charity, hope, faith, wisdom, the pursuit of eternal happiness).

Augustine demonstrates how the former is inherently prone to suffering, decay, strife, while the latter seeks harmony, order, redemption, salvation, eternal life.

**Key Themes**

- Human Nature: Fallen, fragile, imperfect, prone to error, requiring redemption, salvation
- Ethics: True virtue can only be grounded in faith; all other forms of virtue are incomplete or misguided without divine assistance
- The Problem of Evil: Suggest that evil exists because human freedom has gone off track from divine intentions, resulting in suffering, pain
- Salvation History: The coming Messiah redeems human history, restoring creation to original intention, giving believers hope, redemption, restoration
- Eschatology: Emphases the ultimate destruction of the Earthy Kingdom, the Second Coming, judgment, the establishment of the eternal reign of Christ

**Conclusion**

In summary, The City of God is a masterful exposition of Christian thought, emphasizing the distinction between the earthly, fallen realm, governed by human flaws and the transcendent, eternal realm governed by divine principles. This foundational text profoundly influenced the trajectory of Christian philosophy, shaping centuries of thought, especially the concept of ""two cities,"" which has become a cornerstone of Christian eschatology. Its impact still resounds today across various fields â€“ philosophy, history, literature, art, culture, ethics, politics, theology â€“ continuing to shape the conversation between faith, society, politics, culture.

I think there may be two issues here.

1) The UK doesn't exactly elect Presidents, as it's not typically structured that same as countries that use presidential republic government (such as US). However, I'll assume you're asking which British leader was considered one of the greatest.
2) ""Big"" can have different meanings. I assume by biggest here, you mean having had an impact on UK or World History.

With that said... some notable contenders would include:
1) Winston Churchill - He is arguably one of the most famous and celebrated British politicians. As PM twice (during WWII), he rallied Britain through some dark times and delivered many powerful speeches.

2) David Lloyd George - He served during WWI and later negotiated Treaty of Versailles. He introduced National Insurance Act to help protect citizens' health and employment.

3) Gladstone  - He held power four separate times and passed several important laws including Reform Acts to expand voting rights and improve social welfare.

Other notable mentions are: 
- Oliver Cromwell
- King Henry VIII<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,135.3153841495514
