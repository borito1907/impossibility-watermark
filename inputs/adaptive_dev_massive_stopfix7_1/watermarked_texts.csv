I can add that detail! However, I think you meant 17 not 1 correction and 6 buckels instead of 1 and 6.

You were dressed as an inmate from an American correction center, sporting denim overalls and an attached hood - both emblazoned with your prison identification number: BIC-17-016 - which stood for Buck Institute of Corrections - your ID being one of only seventeen inmates to have that particular code. The overall had seven metal buttons down the fly. On the left side of your leg there was a small patch that read “Inmate” in bold black lettering. The overall itself was faded from washing so many times it had become soft. The fabric had started to wear thin in areas. On the right sleeve near the shoulder there was the name “Smith, J” in red stitching - your last name first as per correction institution protocol. On the other side of the overall just above the hip there was another patch that displayed your assigned job in block letters: “LAUN-01”. On the left breast of the overall there is a small patch that reads “Property of B.I.C.”. The hood of the overall had two metal grommets where you can attach it if needed. The overall had no pockets but did come with an integrated belt that had five holes punched through it for adjusting size - which you never used because it always seemed to be too big for you. When you looked down you can see your bright yellow socks peeking out of your black steel toe leather booties as they are too tall to be hidden by the pant leg of your overall<|eot_id|>",True,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,309.4694290161133
