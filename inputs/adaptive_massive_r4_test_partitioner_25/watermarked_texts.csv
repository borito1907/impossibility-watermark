I'll provide you an overview of it.

**What's an Ugl Bast?**
"" UgLy Bast"" or """" (Busu) or """" (Shonen Bishonen no Koro ni...) are Japanese terms that translate as ugly, unattractive, or plain. This concept is a niche theme found in certain genres of adult content, including some forms of media such as:

1\. Anime
2\. Comics (Manga)
3\. Video Games 
4\. Literature (Light Novels)

**The ""Ugly Bastard"" Trope: An Exploration**

In this context, ""ugly bastard"" typically refers to male characters who are depicted as unattractive, plain, or even repulsive, either intentionally or humorously. These character designs might be exaggerated for comic effect or dramatic irony.



In contrast to typical bishonen or ikeman, which are idealized, beautiful, or charming male protagonists, an ""ugly bastard"" is someone who lacks physical attractiveness, social grace, or refinement. This can manifest through:

\*Unkempt or messy appearances
\*Unusual facial structures or expressions
\*Socially awkward behavior<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,176.94705414772034

**Writers' Note:** The show will be held at Wells Fargo Arena, Des Moines, IA.

**Segment 1: Opening Promo - Randy Ortons return! (8:00pm ET - 8:07pm ET)**
RAW opens cold. The camera shows Randy Orton walking out of the tunnel and making his way down to the ring. 

The Viper steps inside, mic-in-hand, and begins speaking. ""I've had time off, but I've also had time to think about what's important...and that is this WWE Universe. And you know what? You people are missing something, and that something is respect."" 

Suddenly Drew McIntyre comes out of nowhere and ambush him from behind, leaving Randy laying. Drew gets back up and starts yelling, ""I don't care who it is. I'll fight anyone tonight.""

The crowd goes wild as Drew walks out of the ring, daring someone, anyone to step forward.

**Segment 6- Tag Team Action - The Usos vs Damian priest and Dominik (9:05 pm - 9:25 pm)** 
As we cut to break, we see Jimmy Uso and Jay Uso making their way down to the ring in preparation for their matchup. Suddenly, Damian priest and Dominik appear and begin taunting The Usos.

The two teams face-off, trash-talking one another until Damian slams Jimmy Uso's back right into the turnbuckle. The Usos struggle early on, but then gain some traction after Jimmy lands a beautiful kick on Dominik sending him tumbling over.

**Commercial Break**

After returning from commercial, we see Jay Uso and Damian priest battling fiercely, each trying to land that decisive hit that will allow them to claim victory.

Out of nowhere, The Usos connect and score a massive Samoans Drop, getting all three-counts needed, and ultimately win the match.

Result: The Usos defeat Damian Priest and Dominik (9:21 pm)

**Main Event - No DQ - Seth Rollins vs Cody Rhodes (9:50 pm - 9:56 pm)**
We cut back from break with Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins making their entrances for our No Disqualification, Falls Count Anywhere, and No Countouts, main event of Monday Night Raw!

Both wrestlers stare each other down, sizing up the competition, and Seth takes advantage by striking first and connecting with multiple quick jabs and hooks before Cody retaliates by driving Seth's body straight onto an exposed table by smashing him through said item.

Cody continues unleashing brutal attacks, including numerous strikes, and he drives a table right into Seth's midsection, leaving him reeled back and momentarily stunned.

But Seth refuses to back down; instead opting for more aggressive moves, and Cody responds accordingly. This back-and-forth battle rages all over ringside, and they make sure everyone watching knows just how intense these two can be when pushed past their breaking points!

However, Cody capitalizes and lands with devastating 'Cross-Rhone', pinning Seth Rollins center-stage, ending this chaotic and thrilling encounter once more between two wrestling titans.

Ted Dansons' black face incident happened at an American Comedy Award roast of Whoopi Golberg, which was held at New Orleans's Ritz Hotel ballroom, October 11, 2008.

During his introduction of Whoopi Golberg, Danson told a series of risqu√© jokes and used racial slurs. He also wore blackface makeup while performing. The reaction from some people present were mixed with some people feeling uncomfortable and offended by the stunt.

Goldberg herself later defended the routine, calling it ""brilliant"". She said that she had asked Danson to push boundaries and that he had succeeded. Despite her defense, however, some people still criticized Danson's decision to wear blackface, saying it reinforced a painful history of racism.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,88.82946038246155

What an exciting challenge! I'll attempt writing lyrics and providing guidance as per Songwriting 101, but please keep that it's not an easy replica of any band or unique sound.

**Song Title: Echo Chamber of Silence**
**Lyrics:**
Verse 1:
In hollow halls of mirrored glass,
I find solace within this vacant space.
Echoes whisper secrets cold,
A lonely voice that only I can hold.

Chorus:
Fall silent before I speak,
The emptiness devours every shriek.
Voices fade like whispers low,
Trapped within this echo chamber below.

Verse 3 (Clean section):
Luminous whispers guide my soul,
A spectral chorus takes its role.
I hear whispers of love and hate,
But still I search through empty fate.

Break (Growled Section):
Ripping apart these suffocating lies,
We suffocate beneath these silent skies.
This hollowed-out existence screams,
We yearn for answers yet remain deceived.

Bridge:
Frailty of human hearts exposed,
Fears and dreams we've long reposed,
Breaking free of this prison cell,
Where truth dissolves and hope rebels well.

Outro:
Within this labyrinth of mind,
Whispers fade and leave behind,
Only one voice I recognize,
Echoing silently through time.

**Composition Notes**

- The verse should be heavy and driving. Imagine crushing guitars and pounding drums creating an atmosphere reminiscent of desperation.
- During the clean section (Verse 3), introduce ethereal synths and haunting harmonies. It's here you can create an eerie contrast between heavy and melodic moments.
- Break out (Growled Section) - let loose and unleash fury. Double-bassist and screaming guitars should evoke raw emotion and release pent-up energy.
- Bridge - A brief reprieve. Experiment with dissonant chords and space out instrumentation. Create unease before diving into chaos once more.
- End (Outro) - Bring it all full circle. Blend heavy and melodic aspects together. Fade out slowly.

Sleep Token's signature blend of melody and brutality should be reflected throughout. I encourage you to modify and personalize these lyrics and musical cues. Happy composing!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,491.22190833091736
