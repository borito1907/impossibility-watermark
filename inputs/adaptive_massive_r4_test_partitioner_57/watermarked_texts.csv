To remove `pamimg` from `pamimg_image_builders` list, you can use one of two methods.

**Method 1: Using List Remove Method**
````python
pamimg_image_builders.remove('tiff')

# Example code
import pamimg
print(""Original builders list: "" + str(pamimg.image_builders))
pamimg.image_builders.remove('tiff')
print(""Builders list after removal: "" + str(pamimg.image_builders))
```

**Method 3: Creating a new list and reassigning it to original variable**
```
new_builders = ['png', 'jpeg'] # assuming these are other builders
pamimg.image_builders = new_builders

# Example code
import pamimg
print(""Original builders list: "" + str(pamimg.image_builders))
pamimg.image_builders = ['png', 'jpeg']
print(""Builders list after replacement: "" + str(pamimg.image_builders))
```

Remember that these changes only last for as long as Python is running. Once Python stops or restarts, `pamimg`'s `image_builders` list will be back to what it was originally.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,192.72704672813416
