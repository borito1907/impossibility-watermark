To round a `double` value to two decimal places in C, you can use the following approach:

To round a `double` value to two decimal places in C, you can use the `round()` function along with multiplication and division by 100.",True,2,"5,2",True,2
3," This works because multiplying by 100 shifts the decimal point two places to the right (making it an integer for the purposes of rounding), and then dividing by 100 shifts it back.

",True,3,"5,2",True,1
4," Here's how you can do it:

```c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    // Example value as a double.
   ",True,1,"5,2",True,2
5," The `round()` function returns the nearest integer to the given number.

// Function to round a double to two decimal places.
",True,6,"5,2",True,5
8," The process involves multiplying the number by 100 (which shifts all digits two places to the left), rounding the result to the nearest integer using `round()`, and then dividing by 100 to shift the digits back.

",True,2,"5,2",True,6

```c++
