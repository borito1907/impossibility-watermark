(Verse 1)
In the dead of night, I'm up and awake,
The washer's hummin', it's time to partake,
In this clandestine chore, where shadows play,
I sort the lights from the darks, by feelin' my way.

(Verse 1)
I stumbled into the room, half asleep and alone 
The washing machine was calling, I had to atone 
For all the dirty clothes that piled up high 
But as I reached for the switch, I realized I'd said goodbye 

To the lights, it seemed they'd gone astray 
Now I'm sorting socks by feel, in a dark of day 
Whites from colors, delicates too 
It's a guessing game, but I'll see this through 

(Chorus) Doing laundry in the dark 
A midnight chore, without a spark 
Rinse and spin, in the darkness reigns 
Hoping I don't make any stains 

(Verse 2) Shirts and pants and sheets galore 
I match them up, or so I explore 
My hands move slow, my senses high 
As I fold and put away, before I say goodbye 

The rumble of the dryer's my guide 
A soothing sound, that's hard to hide 
As I work through the night 
Doing laundry, with no light 

(Chorus) Doing laundry in the dark 
A midnight chore, without a spark 
Rinse and spin, in the darkness reigns 
Hoping I don't make any stains 

(Bridge) It may not be easy, but I won't give in 
The darkness might just become my friend 
In the shadows, I find a peaceful place 
Where the laundry's done, without a single face 

(Chorus) Doing laundry in the dark 
A midnight chore, without a spark 
Rinse and spin, in the darkness reigns 
Hoping I don't make any stains

But as I stumble through the night, with only moonlight shinin' bright I trip on socks and t-shirts too My fingers fumble, can't quite get a clue On which detergent to use, or how much water to choose

Fumbled for the dials, tried to recall what's next to do

Hoping I'm not mixing delicates with something that's rough, too

Sorting's hard when you can't see the stains

Guessing what's clean and what remains

But I won't let the darkness get the best of me, no way

Feeling through the baskets, trying to distinguish textures fine

Between the soft tees and jeans so divine

Detergent sounds like treasure in my hand

Rationing water, praying nothing gets lost in this planned land

Sorting's hard when you can't see the stains

Guessing what's clean and what remains

Somehow the soap still works its magic charm

Cleansing more than just these garments worn

In the blackness, where fear usually reigns

Hope clings tight - and wash and rinse refrains

Unseen textures confuse fingers that try to begin 
Tangles web like mysteries left unsolved

Piled high on floor, like an endless fight 
Gently tossing them into dryer's mouth
