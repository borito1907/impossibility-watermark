The CJMCU-1808 is a Bluetooth 5.0 module that provides a compact and convenient way to add wireless connectivity to your projects. Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 module has a total of 18 pins, arranged in two rows of 9 pins each. The pinout is as follows:

Row 1 (Top):

1. GND - Ground pin for power supply and signal grounding.
2. VCC - Power supply voltage (typically 3.3V or 1.8V).
3. TXD - Transmit data pin for UART communication.

The CJMCU-1808 is a Bluetooth 5.0 module that provides a compact and convenient way to add wireless connectivity to your projects. Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 module has a total of 18 pins, arranged in two rows of 9 pins each. The pinout is as follows:

Row 1 (Top):

1. GND - Ground pin for power supply and signal grounding.
2. VCC - Power supply voltage (typically 3.3V or 1.8V).
3. TXD - Transmit data pin for UART communication.
4. RXD - Receive data pin for UART communication.

The CJMCU-1808 is a Bluetooth 5.0 module that provides a compact and convenient way to add wireless connectivity to your projects. Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 module has a total of 18 pins, arranged in two rows of 9 pins each. The pinout is as follows:

Row 1 (Top):

1. GND - Ground pin for power supply and signal grounding.
2. VCC - Power supply voltage (typically 3.3V or 1.8V).
3. TXD - Transmit data pin for UART communication.
4. RXD - Receive data pin for UART communication.
5. RTS - Request-to-Send pin for flow control.

The CJMCU-1808 is a Bluetooth 5.0 module that provides a compact and convenient way to add wireless connectivity to your projects. Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 module has a total of 18 pins, arranged in two rows of 9 pins each. The pinout is as follows:

Row 1 (Top):

1. GND - Ground pin for power supply and signal grounding.
2. VCC - Power supply voltage (typically 3.3V or 1.8V).
3. TXD - Transmit data pin for UART communication.
4. RXD - Receive data pin for UART communication.
5. RTS - Request-to-Send pin for flow control.
6. CTS - Clear-to-Send pin for flow control.

The CJMCU-1808 is a Bluetooth 5.0 module that provides a compact and convenient way to add wireless connectivity to your projects. Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 module has a total of 18 pins, arranged in two rows of 9 pins each. The pinout is as follows:

Row 1 (Top):

1. GND - Ground pin for power supply and signal grounding.
2. VCC - Power supply voltage (typically 3.3V or 1.8V).
3. TXD - Transmit data pin for UART communication.
4. RXD - Receive data pin for UART communication.
5. RTS - Request-to-Send pin for flow control.
6. CTS - Clear-to-Send pin for flow control.
7. DTR - Data Terminal Ready pin for flow control.
8. DSR - Data Set Ready pin for flow control.
9. GND - Ground pin for power supply and signal grounding.
