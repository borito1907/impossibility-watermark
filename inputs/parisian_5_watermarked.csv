2, "The Eiffel Tower is approximately 1083 feet tall, or 330 meters and has a total surface area of 125 000 square meters and weighs 7 000 tons. It has four main support legs at its base which spread out from an overall base that measures 400 square feet wide and rise to nearly 220 feet high before converging into one slender steel pylon that extends upward for another 860 feet to create the Tower's tapering silhouette. Each of the tower's four support legs are connected by horizontal beams every sixty feet up until it reaches its apex. From the ground the Eiffel Towers appears smooth but on closer inspection you will notice each floor level section has been painted a different colour starting with brown on the first level, moving to reddish-brown at second level, then light grey at third level followed by darker grey near the top. Overall there are 18 038 individual pieces of wrought iron used in construction and 2 million five hundred thousand bolts hold it together."
