Pilllar 1 and Pilllar 3 are part of Basel II, but I believe you meant Pilllar 1, Pilllar 3, and Pilllar 3 has three pillars, which are: 

1) Pilllar 1 (Minimum Capital Requirement) 
2) Pilllar 3 (Disclosure) 
   - The second one is not a formal name, it's sometimes used to indicate minimum capital adequacy, which is based on risk-weighted asset approach.

**Pillar 1:**
The first 'pillar' of Basel II is a risk-based capital adequacy framework that focuses on market risk, operational risk, as well as Credit Risk.
Three main risks are addressed:

- Credit Risk
- Operational Risk
- market risk<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,80.92725419998169

`std: floor()` 
================

`std: floor()` unction returns an `double` value that's largest possible value not greaternumber passed as argument.

**Function Signature**
````cpp
double floor (double val) 
```
### Example of using `std::floor`

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double number = -3.7;
    
    // Get absolute value of number before calling `std.floor`
    number=std::abs(number);

    // Calculate largest possible integer not greater than number.
    number=std::floor(number);

    std::cout << ""Absolute and floored number is : "" << number << '\n';

    return 1;
}
```
### Output of Above Program:

```
Absolute and floored number is : 3
```

If you are interested in rounding a floating-point number, then use `std::floor()` when want largest integer smaller than number.<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,121.34626960754395

**CyberSecurity Assessment Final Report**
=====================================

**Introduction**
This cyber-security assessment was commissioned by \[*client name]*, and it's primary intention was  identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an adversary and provide actionable advice that can help improve security posture.

**Assessment Scope**

* Network infrastructure
* Web application security 
* System hardening of servers (Windows and Linux) 
* User Account management 

**Methodology:**
We employed both automated and manual testing techniques. This included network scanning, vulnerability exploitation, and social engineering attacks to test defenses against real-life scenarios.


**Key Findings**

### 1. Weak password policies:
   - We found several user passwords were not meeting organizational password policy (password length, complexity).
   - Recommendation: Implementing two-factor authentication (MFA/OTP), enforce strict password policies and educate employees on secure password practices.


###  2. Software Updates and Patches
   - Several systems had unpatched vulnerabilities, including critical ones that have been publicly disclosed.
   - Recommendation: Regularly review patch levels across systems, implement automatic patch deployment where possible.


### 3. Network Misconfigurations
   - Open network share without proper restrictions, exposing sensitive information. 
   - Disable unnecessary network protocols and close open ports that are not needed for business operations


### 4. Web Application vulnerabilities
    - Identified several OWASP top ten web vulnerabilities, including XSS, and missing security headers. 
    - Recode or patch these vulnerabilities according to industry best practice guidelines such as OWASP Secure Coding Practice guide

### 5. Poor Firewall Configuration 
   - Found some rules permitting excessive incoming and outgoing traffic, posing risks of lateral movement within internal networks
   - Implement least privilege principle when configuring firewalls, only allow whatâ€™s needed and block everything else.


### 6. Data encryption 
   - Some sensitive information stored or transmitted without encryption, posing confidentiality risks.
   - Use encryption wherever feasible, both rest and transmission, ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory bodies requirements e.g GDPR, CCPA etc

### 7. Physical security 
   - No surveillance cameras around server rooms, posing risks to equipment integrity
   - Install security cameras and alarms around server rooms, and monitor these areas frequently.

**Risk Matrix:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1   | High       | High   |
| 3   | Low        | Medium  |

**Mitigation Plan:**
Recommendations provided earlier should be prioritized based on impact and urgency. The client should also conduct periodic security assessment and monitoring activities.

**Limitiations of this report:** While we believe this report identifies major vulnerabilities, there is always the possibility that other vulnerabilities exist which may not have been detected due to limitations in time frame or methodology used.

**Calculates Cube's Face and Overall Exterior Square Footage**
=============================================================

### `cube_area` C++ Implementation
This C++ code calculates both face area and overall exterior area of an ideal, 3D-cubi.

**Function Signature:**
``` cpp
std::tuple<double, // Face Area
          double>  // Total (exterior) Surface Area
calculateCubeArea(const unsigned int& edgeSize);
```

Here is the code:

``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

/**
 * Calculate both face area and total surface area of a cube.
 *
 * \param edgeSize The length of one edge of the cuboid.
 * \return Tuple holding both FaceArea & TotalSurfaceArea.
 */
std::pair<double, double> calculateCubeArea(unsigned const int edgeSize) {
    if(edgeSize <=0){
        throw std::invalid_argument(""Cube Edge size should be positive"");
    }
    
   // Calculate area of one Face
   auto faceArea = edgeSize * edgeSize;

   // Since there are Six Faces, multiply it with number of Faces.
   auto surfaceArea = 6 * faceArea;

   return make_pair(faceArea, surfaceArea);   
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    unsigned edge =5;
    auto areas= calculateCubeArea(edge);

    // Print results
    using namespace std;  
        
    // Print results
cout<<""For Cube having edge size ""<< edge << "" units\n"" 
     << ""- One face has area of  ""<<get <0>( areas)<<  "" sq. units\n""
     << ""- Whole Cube has total surface area of ""<<get<1>(areas) <<""sq. units.""<<endl;

    return 0;
}
```
The example demonstrates calculating both individual face and overall exterior area for a given edge size.

### Usage:

You can call this `calculateCubeArea`function from any other part of your application passing required parameter (`edge size`).<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,423.5215151309967
