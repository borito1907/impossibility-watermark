Configurare in modalità bridge router tplink td-w8950ndassistant

To configure the TP-LINK TD-W8950ND router in bridge mode, follow these steps:

**Important:** Before starting, please note that configuring your router in bridge mode will disable its DHCP server and wireless access point functions.

1. Open a web browser and type `tplinkwifi.net` (or the IP address of your router, usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) to access the router's web interface.
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (default is `admin` for both).
3. Click on **Advanced Setup** at the top of the page.
4. Select **LAN Settings** from the left-hand menu.
5. In the LAN Settings page, under **Operation Mode**, select **Bridge** from the dropdown list.
6. Set the **IP Address** and **Subnet Mask** according to your network requirements. You can also set it to obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP) if you're unsure.
7. Save changes by clicking **Apply** or **Save**.
8. Go back to the main menu and click on **Wireless Settings**.
9. Disable the Wireless Radio function by toggling the switch next to **Enable Wireless Radio**.
10. Save changes again by clicking **Apply** or **Save**.
11. Finally, to complete the bridge mode setup, you need to connect two Ethernet cables: one from the WAN port (Internet) to the LAN port of another router (if you're extending your network), and the other from the LAN port of the TD-W8950ND to a LAN port of another device (e.g., a switch).

**Verify Bridge Mode:** After completing these steps, your TP-LINK TD-W8950ND should now be in bridge mode. You can verify this by checking the LED lights on the front panel:

* The Internet light should turn off (since there's no direct internet connection).
* The Wireless light should turn off (since the wireless radio is disabled).
* The LAN lights should stay on (indicating active connections).

Remember, after switching to bridge mode, you won't be able to access the web interface using the original IP address (192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1). Instead, use the new IP address you configured in step 6.

If you face any issues or need further clarification, feel free to ask!assistant
