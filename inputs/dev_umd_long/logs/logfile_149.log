3. **Lag**: Delay or slowdown in online gameplay due to internet connection issues.
4. **Camp**: To stay in one spot for an extended period, (e.g., to ambush opponents) in a game like Fortnite or PUBG.

**Player Interactions**

1. **Salty**: Being bitter or upset about losing or making mistakes.
Example: "Don't be salty just because you lost."
2. **Tilt**: To become frustrated or angry during a game,
 Example: "Dude,'t get tilt,,'t ruin the game for us!"
3. **Smurf**: When a skilled player creates a new account to play against weaker opponents
4. **Flame**: To heavily criticize or insult another player (not recommended!).

**Gaming Culture**

1. **No-scope**: A lucky shot without aiming down sights (e.g., in CS:GO)
2. **Pwn** or **PwN**: To defeat someone convincingly or dominate them in a game
Example: "I got pwnt by that pro gamer."
3. **Frag**: To kill or eliminate an opponent (originated from Quake)
