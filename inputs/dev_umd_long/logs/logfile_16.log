Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.assistant

The entirety of the Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) lore is a complex and intricate narrative that spans across multiple games, series, books, and even movies! But don't worry,ing it all for you.

** Warning: This explanation will contain major spoilers for all FNAF games,'t read if you want to experience the story yourself! **

Here's a condensed version of the FNAF lore:

**The Beginning**
In the 1980s, a man named William Afton founded a company called Afton Robotics. He created animatronic animals (Freddie Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox) designed to entertain children at his family restaurants, called "Fredbear's Family Diners" or simply "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza."

**The Murders**
William Afton, who would later be known as the Purple Guy, used the animatronic suits to lure and murder numerous children at the restaurants. The animatronics were programmed to recognize and respond to children's laughter and screams, which ultimately helped Afton in his heinous crimes.

**The Hauntings**
After the murders, the restaurants were shut down, and the animatronics were left abandoned. However, the spirits of the murdered children became trapped inside the animatronics, to haunt them. These animatronics, now referred to as "ghosts," sought revenge against adults who entered their territory.

**Game 1: Five Nights at Freddy's**
The game takes place in the year 1993, where a new restaurant, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, has been opened on top of the old Fredbear's Family Diner location. You play as Mike Schmidt, a security guard trying to survive five nights at the restaurant while avoiding being attacked by the haunted animatronics.

**Game 2: Five Nights at Freddy's 2**
Set before the events of Game 1, the prequel takes place in 1987, just after the murders occurred. You play as Jeremy Fitzgerald, a newly hired security guard at the original Fredbear's Family Diner. New animatronics, like Toy Freddy and the Marionette, have been introduced, but they too become haunted and hostile towards humans.

**Game 3: Five Nights at Freddy's 3**
In 2015, 30 years after the events of Game 2, a theme park called Fazbear's Fright: The At
