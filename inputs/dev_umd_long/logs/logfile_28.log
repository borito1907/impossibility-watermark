Create a psychological portrait of a person who values their time 1000000000usd per second assistant

What an intriguing and thought-provoking request! 

Assuming a person truly believes their time is worth $1,000,000,000 per second (which is approximately $63,000,000,000,000 per hour), here's a possible psychological portrait:

**Name:** Chronos (a nod to the Greek god of time)

**Personality:**

* **Ruthless efficiency:** Chronos has an unyielding focus on maximizing every moment. They prioritize tasks with precision, aiming to accomplish as much as possible in the shortest timeframe. This individual will not tolerate unnecessary delays or distractions.
* **Time is money:** Literally. Every moment lost is perceived as a financial loss, which fuels a strong sense of urgency and pressure to constantly perform at an optimal level.
* **Self-importance:** With a value assigned to their time that surpasses many countries' GDPs, to say they have a strong sense of self-importance would be an understatement. This person might come across as assertive, even arrogant, when discussing their schedule or commitments.

**Cognitive Style:**

* **Ultra-short attention span:** With an astronomical value attached to each passing second, Chronos might struggle with maintaining concentration for prolonged periods. They'll likely favor short, high-intensity bursts of productivity over longer, more relaxed work sessions.
* **Hyper-vigilant:** Constantly aware of time slipping away, Chronos might exhibit traits like anxiety or irritability if others aren't meeting their expectations or respecting their schedule.

**Emotional Landscape:**

* **Stress and burnout risk:** The weight of such immense value tied to time could lead to chronic stress, anxiety, or exhaustion. This individual may need to develop coping mechanisms to avoid emotional overwhelm.
* **Resentment towards time-wasters:** Those who don't share their reverence for time management might face Chronos' frustration or resentment, potentially leading to conflicts or distancing themselves from perceived "time-wasters."

**Relationship Dynamics:**

* **Utilitarian connections:** Chronos will likely form relationships based on mutual benefit, where both parties recognize the value of each other's time. They may prioritize networking opportunities over socializing or emotional bonding.
* **Expectations vs. reality:** Partners, colleagues, or friends might find it challenging to meet Chronos' sky-high expectations regarding punctuality, task completion, or general productivity.

**Life Choices and Habits:**

* **Streamlined routines:** To optimize time usage, Chronos will likely adopt highly efficient daily routines
