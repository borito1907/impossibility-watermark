What is the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 x 10–2 M KOH solution?assistant

A chemistry question!

To find the H+ ion concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base, which means it completely dissociates in water.

In this case, the OH- ions from KOH will react with H+ ions from water to form water molecules:

OH- + H+ → H₂O

The concentration of OH- ions will be equal to the concentration of KOH, which is given as 4.8 x 10⁻² M.

Now, we can use the dissociation constant of water (Kw = 1 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the fact that [OH-][H+] = Kw to find the H+ ion concentration:

[OH-] = 4.8 x 10⁻² M
[Kw] = 1 x 10⁻¹⁴
[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1 x 10⁻¹⁴ / 4.8 x 10⁻²
≈ 2.08 x 10⁻¹³ M

So, the H+ ion concentration in the 4.8 x 10⁻² M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 x 10⁻¹³ M.

Do you have any follow-up questions or would you like me to explain anything further?assistant

Wait, I think I see what's coming next...

You want to convert the H+ ion concentration to pH, don't you?

If so, here's the calculation:

pH = -log₁₀[H+]
= -log₁₀(2.08 x 10⁻¹³)
≈ 12.68

So, the pH of the 4.8 x 10⁻² M KOH solution is approximately 12.68.

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!assistant

Is there anything else I can assist you with?assistant
