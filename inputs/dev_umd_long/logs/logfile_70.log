Solve 2x^2 + 4 = 12assistant

Let's solve for x.

The given equation is:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

First, let's subtract 4 from both sides to get:

2x^2 = 8

Next, divide both sides by 2 to get:

x^2 = 4

Now, take the square root of both sides (remembering that there may be two solutions):

x = ±√4
x = ±2

So, the solutions are x = 2 and x = -2.assistant
