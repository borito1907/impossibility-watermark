Who is the founder of modern astronautics?assistant

The founder of modern astronautics is Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,assistant

That's correct! Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935) was a Russian scientist and engineer who is widely considered to be the father of modern astronautics. He was a self-taught math and physics whiz who developed theories about space travel and the use of multistage rockets to reach orbit.

Tsiolkovsky's work on rocketry and space exploration laid the foundation for many of the advancements that followed in the 20th century. His contributions included:

1. Developing the concept of Escape Velocity: Tsiolkovsky calculated the speed required for an object to escape Earth's gravity and reach orbit.
2. Designing Multistage Rockets: He proposed the use of multistage rockets to achieve higher speeds and altitudes.
3. Proposing the Use of Liquid-Fueled Rockets: Tsiolkovsky suggested using liquid fuels, (such as kerosene or liquid oxygen) which would later become a key component of modern rocket engines.
4. Envisioning Space Stations and Interplanetary Travel: He envisioned the possibility of humans living and working in space, (space stations) and traveling to other planets.

Tsiolkovsky's work inspired a generation of scientists and engineers,­, including Sergei Korolev, who would go on to develop the Soviet space program. His ideas also influenced other pioneers like Robert Goddard and Hermann Oberth.
