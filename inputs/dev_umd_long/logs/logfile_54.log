Tell me about the book "Don Quixote" by Michael Chabon.assistant

I think there may be some confusion here!

"Don Quixote" is actually not a book written by Michael Chabon. The famous novel "Don Quixote" was written by Miguel de Cervantes and first published in 1605.

However, a great piece of news: Michael Chabon did write an introduction to a modern translation of "Don Quixote" (translated by Burton Raffel) in 2003. But he didn't author the original book itself.

The original "Don Quixote" is considered one of the greatest works of literature in the Western canon, and is often regarded as the first modern novel. It tells the story of a nobleman, Alonso Quixano, who has become obsessed with the idea of chivalry and knighthood. He renames himself Don Quixote and, you know the rest - he sets out on a series of absurd and poignant adventures with his trusty sidekick Sancho Panza.

If you're interested in reading "Don Quixote", I'd be happy to provide more information or recommendations on which edition or translation to choose!assistant
