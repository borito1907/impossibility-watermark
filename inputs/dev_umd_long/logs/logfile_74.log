a + b + c = a, b * a =  1, b =3assistant

It seems like you're trying to solve an algebraic equation.

Let's break it down step by step!

Given equations:

1) a + b + c =?
2) b * a = 1
3) b = 3

From equation (3), we know b = 3.

Substitute this value into equation (2):
b * a = 1 --> 3 * a = 1

Now, divide both sides by 3:
a = 1/3

Next, substitute the values of a and b into equation (1):
a + b + c =?

Becomes:
(1/3) + 3 + c =?

Combine the constants:
c =? - 10/3

To find the value of c, we need another equation or constraint. If you provide more information or clarify what you're looking for, I'd be happy to help further!assistant
