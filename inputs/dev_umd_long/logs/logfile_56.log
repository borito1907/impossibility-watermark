hello world program in pascalassistant

A classic!

Here is the traditional "Hello, World!" program in Pascal:
```
program HelloWorld;

begin
 write('Hello, World!');
readln;
end.
```
Let me explain what's going on:

* `program HelloWorld;` - This line begins the program and gives it the name "HelloWorld".
* `begin` - This keyword marks the beginning of the program's code block.
* `write('Hello, World!');` - This statement uses the built-in `write` function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
* `readln;` - This statement uses the built-in `readln` function to pause the program and wait for the user to press Enter (return). This is often used to prevent the console window from closing immediately after the program runs.
* `end.` - This keyword marks the end of the program's code block.

Note: The `readln;` statement is not strictly necessary, to print "Hello, World!", but it's commonly included to make the output more interactive and easier to observe.

To compile and run this program, you'll need a Pascal compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Pascal programming language. Some popular options include Turbo Pascal, Free Pascal, and Delphi.assistant
