A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?assistant

To find the skier's speed at the bottom, to do this problem, you need to use conservation of energy!

Let's break it down:

1. The skier starts from rest at the top of the slope (initial velocity = 0).
2. As the skier slides down, their potential energy (PE) is converted to kinetic energy (KE).
3. Since the slope is frictionless, no energy is lost due to friction.

We can set up an equation using the law of conservation of energy:

 Initial PE = Final KE

The initial potential energy (PE) is given by:

PE = mgh

where m is the mass of the skier (which we'll assume is unknown), g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

Now, let's calculate the initial PE:

PE = m × 9.8 × 40
= 392m J

Since all the PE gets converted to KE at the bottom of the slope, we can write:

392m = ½mv²

where v is the final velocity (speed) of the skier at the bottom of the slope.

Now, simplify the equation by canceling out the'm' term on both sides:

392 = ½v²

Multiply both sides by 2 to get:

784 = v²

Take the square root of both sides:

v ≈ √784 ≈ 28.07 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the frictionless slope is approximately **28.07 m/s**!assistant
