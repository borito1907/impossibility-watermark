What a fascinating crossover idea! Here's a short story about Sonic as Spider-Man:

**The Web of Speed**

In a bizarre twist of fate, a strange meteorite crashed into the heart of Central City, than usual. The blast sent shockwaves throughout the land,2018 4th quarter. As it turned out, an alien artifact within the crater began emitting an otherworldly energy field.

Meanwhile, in New York City, the one and only Peter Parker,'t paying attention as he web-slinged across Manhattan. Suddenly, the mysterious energy enveloped him, causing his spider-powers to go haywire.

As Peter struggled to regain control, a blinding flash illuminated the night sky. When the light faded, a blue blur stood before him - none other than Sonic the Hedgehog.

Sonic, now infused with Peter's powers, wore a sleek, high-tech costume adorned with the iconic red spider emblem on his chest. His quills,'t transformed into razor-sharp "web-quills" capable of shooting spider-like webs at incredible velocities.

With great power comes great responsibility, and Sonic took this mantra to heart. Dubbing himself "Spider-Sonic," he set out to protect both his world and the unfamiliar streets of New York.

Dr. Eggman, ever the opportunist,'t far behind. He'd been secretly manipulating the meteorite's trajectory, the better to harness its energy for his doomsday device. Now, with Spider-Sonic patrolling the skies,'t no match for the mad doctor's robotic minions.

Without hesitation, Spider-Sonic sprang into action. His superhuman agility and speed allowed him to dodge laser beams and disarm robots with ease. Web-quills ensnared his foes, leaving them helpless against the blue blur's lightning-fast combos.

As news spread like wildfire,'t the people of New York were initially baffled by the sight of their beloved Spider-Man fighting crime with the speed and attitude of a certain blue hedgehog. Before long, they cheered on Spider-Sonic as if he were their own hometown hero.

Just as Dr. Eggman's latest scheme teetered on collapse, Spider-Sonic confronted him face-to-face. A sly smirk played on Sonic's lips as he prepared to put the mad doctor out of business once again...

"You should have stuck to kidnapping Amy Rose,'t Doctor - you really aren't cut out for the whole 'conquering-the-universe' thing."
