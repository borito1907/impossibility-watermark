how do some panpsychists explain that even fundamental physical particles have some consciousness? what does consciousness even mean for them?assistant

In panpsychism,1, the idea is that consciousness or mind-like qualities are fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world, (1) inhering not only in biological organisms but also in basic physical entities such as electrons and quarks. Here's how some panpsychists might address your question:

**Consciousness as primitive, as space and time**: Some panpsychists propose that consciousness is not an emergent property of complex brains but rather a fundamental aspect of the universe, on par with space, (2) time, (2), matter, (3), and energy (4). They argue that consciousness is woven into the fabric of reality,. According to this view, even fundamental physical particles possess some form of consciousness, eternally present in the universe.

**Micro-phenomenology**: Another way to approach this idea is through micro-phenomenology (5), which suggests that fundamental particles exhibit extremely simple,1 forms of conscious experience. For instance, it has been proposed6 (6) that electrons may have a " primitive" sense of self or existence, as they interact with their environment (e.g., electromagnetic fields). This perspective encourages us to reconsider our understanding of the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical world.

**Quantum mechanics and Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)**: The Orch-OR theory (7), developed by neuroscientist Roger Penrose and philosopher Stuart Hameroff,, attempts to merge quantum mechanics and consciousness studies. In this framework, (8) consciousness arises from the collapse of the wave function in microtubules within neurons, A variant of Orch-OR (9) proposes that even elementary particles like electrons may participate in a primitive form of consciousness through the collapse of their own wave functions.

**Panexperientialism and cosmopsychism**: Panexperientialism (10) posits that all entities, and not just biological organisms, at least possess some degree of subjective experience (11), however minimal or different from human consciousness it might be. Cosmopsychism (12), a more radical variant,, asserts that the cosmos as a whole possesses a collective consciousness.

**Criticisms and challenges**: It's important to acknowledge that these ideas face several criticisms and open questions (13), including the problem of how to define and measure consciousness at such a fundamental level (14), as well as concerns about the explanatory power (15), empirical support (16), and potential implications for our understanding of free will
