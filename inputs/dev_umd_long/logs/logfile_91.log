nginx: [emerg] SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey("\/etc\/nginx\/certs\/240110_certs\/private.pem") failed (SSL: error:0B080074:x509 certificate routines:X509_check_private_key:key values mismatch)assistant

It looks like you're experiencing an issue with your Nginx configuration related to SSL certificates.

The error message `SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey` indicates that there's a problem with the private key file (`private.pem`) specified in your Nginx config. The specific error is:

`X509_check_private_key:key values mismatch`

This typically occurs when the private key and certificate files do not match or were not generated together. Here are some troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this issue:

1. **Check the certificate and private key files**: Make sure you have the correct certificate and private key files, the paths to which are specified in your Nginx configuration.
2. **Verify the private key format**: Ensure that the private key file is in the correct format (PEM). You can check this by opening the file in a text editor; it should start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
3. **Compare the certificate and private key modulus**: You can use the following OpenSSL commands to compare the modulus of both files:
```bash
openssl rsa -in /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem -noout -modulus
openssl x509 -in /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/cert.pem -noout -modulus
```
These commands will output the modulus of each file. If they don't match,, you may need to re-generate the private key and certificate files.

4. **Re-generate the private key and certificate files (if necessary)**: If you've made changes to your certificate or private key,,'t forget to update the corresponding files on your server. You can use tools like OpenSSL to generate new key pairs or request new certificates from your Certificate Authority (CA).

5. **Double-check your Nginx configuration**: Verify that the paths to your certificate and private key files are correct in your Nginx configuration file (usually `nginx.conf` or a separate file included from it).

After resolving these potential issues,, try restarting Nginx to apply the changes. If you're still experiencing problems,'t hesitate to provide more details about your setup,+ I'll be happy to assist you further!assistant
