What a complex and sensitive topic! As a helpful personal assistant (not a diplomat or politician), I'll offer a humble other-centric approach to foster understanding and collaboration. Please note that resolving this centuries-old conflict requires careful consideration of historical context, (multiple perspectives), cultural nuances (empathy & active listening), economic disparities (supporting local economies), and social inequalities (addressing refugee crises).

Here's an outline for potential steps towards progress:

1. **Education and Empathy**
    * Encourage people-to-people diplomacy through exchange programs, (scholarships
    * Support educational initiatives highlighting shared human values, as well as 
    distinct cultural heritages (in schools, the world over).

2. **Economic Cooperation**
    * Foster Joint Economic Development Zones (JEDZs) focusing on mutually beneficial projects
    (infrastructure, other industries).
    Create opportunities for Palestinian entrepreneurship in partnership with Israeli
    businesses (mentorship and training programs).

3. **Land Swaps and Borders**
    Negotiate territorial adjustments, which could include (but not limited to):
    * Land swaps: swapping areas of equal value and size.
    Border adjustments (peaceful, (redrawing lines).
    
4. **Security Guarantees**
    Establish trust-building measures between both parties (security guarantees,
    military withdrawals, of IDF troops from the West Bank).

5. **Palestinian Statehood**
    Support the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state, the Gaza Strip, A connected 
    territory (contiguous area).

6. **Jerusalem Administration**
    Develop a unique administration model allowing both parties to peacefully coexist 
    (resolving competing claims).

7. **Regional Support**
    Engage neighboring countries in a dialogue promoting stability,, (diplomacy).

8. **Third Party Mediation**
    Enlist impartial mediators (eg ceasefire observers from Norway, and Switzerland)
