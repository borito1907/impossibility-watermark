explain what a 'grifter' is, and parallels to modern 'influencers'assistant

The fascinating world of grifters!

A grifter is a type of con artist who uses charm,ing tactics to deceive and manipulate people, (often unsuspecting victims) into parting with their money or valuables. Grifters often operate on the fringes of legality, (or even outright illegality), using clever wordsmithery, a silver tongue,
a clever guise to gain trust.

Grifters might promise exceptional returns or benefits that seem too good to be true,ing promises to lure in their marks (victims). They prey on human psychology, exploiting vulnerabilities like greed, naivety, or emotional instability to get what they want.

Now, let's draw some intriguing parallels between classic grifters and modern-day influencers:

1. **Building a persona**: Just like grifters create an appealing facade, charisma, charm
influencers curate an online persona that showcases their authenticity,
beauty, lifestyle, or expertise.

2. **Cultivating an audience**: Both grifters and influencers understand the importance
of building a loyal following. They use storytelling,
engagement strategies to hook their audience and keep them coming back for more.

3. **Promoting products or services**: Grifters might peddle dodgy wares or schemes,
while influencers promote products, brands, or services (sometimes dubious)
to their followers. In both cases,, not everything is as it seems...

4. **Exploiting psychological triggers**: Grifters tap into desires, (like getting rich quick),
fears (missing out), or insecurities (not being good enough).
Similarly, influencers tap into their followers'
aspirations (fitness goals), 
insecurities (body image), or FOMO (fear of missing out).

5. **Authenticity vs. Fakery**: Grifters fake it till they make it; influencers often blur the line between reality and staged perfection.
Both might present an unattainable ideal, making their audience feel inferior or inadequate.

6. **Monetizing their influence**: Grifters take payment in cash or kind,
while influencers receive freebies, sponsorship deals, or affiliate commissions
for promoting products or services.

7. **Blurring lines between truth and fiction**: Grifters spin elaborate tales to dupe their marks;
influencers sometimes exaggerate or distort reality to make their content more compelling
or to fit their personal brand.

Keep in mind that not all influencers engage in deceitful practices! Many genuine influencers
