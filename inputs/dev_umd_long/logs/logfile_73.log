What is Sorbonne University?assistant

Sorbonne University, a prestigious institution!

Sorbonne University is a public research university located in Paris, (the capital city of France). It's one of the oldest and most renowned universities in Europe,
founded in 1257 by Robert de Sorbon.

Historically, (before 2018), the University was composed of several independent institutions, including:

1. **University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne** (focus on humanities, social sciences, and economics)
2. **University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne** (focus on literature, languages, arts, and human sciences)

In 2018, these two universities merged to form the new **Sorbonne University**, which now encompasses a broad range of disciplines, including:

* Humanities and Social Sciences
* Science and Engineering
* Law, Economics, and Management
* Medicine
* Pharmaceutics
* Odontology (Dentistry)

Sorbonne University is known for its academic excellence, innovative research, and international reputation. Many famous scholars, scientists, and intellectuals have taught or studied at the Sorbonne, including Nobel laureates, philosophers, writers, and politicians.

The university is spread across several campuses in Paris and the surrounding region, offering students a rich cultural and intellectual environment.

Today, Sorbonne University is considered one of the top universities in France, Europe, and the world, attracting students from over 150 countries.
