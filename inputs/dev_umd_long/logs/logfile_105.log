Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** "Web of Steel"

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SPIDER-MAN (PETER PARKER) perched atop a building,, his spider-sense tingling as he scans the rooftops below.

PETER
(whispering to himself)
What's going on? I've got a bad feeling about this...

Suddenly, SUPERMAN (KAL-EL/CLARK KENT) bursts onto the scene, hovering in mid-air as he scans the area with his X-ray vision.

SUPERMAN
(to himself)
I've detected unusual energy readings coming from downtown. Could be a threat to the city...

Spider-Man's eyes widen as he takes in the sight of the Man of Steel.

SPIDER-MAN
(psyching himself up)
Time to see what you're made of,, Supes!

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS - DAY

Superman lands on the street, (in a flash of light), just as Spider-Man swings into view, not far behind.

SUPERMAN
(squinting at Spider-Man)
You're not from around here,, are you?

SPIDER-MAN
(smirking)
Just visiting, (flings webs at Superman)

Superman easily deflects the webs with his heat vision.

SUPERMAN
(impressed)
Not bad for a mortal... but you're no match for me.

The two superheroes engage in an epic battle,2014, with punches, kicks, web-shooters firing off left and right as they clash through the streets of Metropolis.

CUT TO:

INT. DAILY PLANET - DAY

LOIS LANE (Clark Kent's love interest) watches the battle unfold on a bank of TV monitors.

LOIS
(concerned)
This isn't good. Clark needs to wrap this up before more innocent bystanders get hurt...

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS - DAY

As the fight rages on, Superman starts to gain the upper hand (his strength begins to overwhelm Spider-Man). Just when it seems like all hope is lost, Spider-Man employs a clever tactic:

SPIDER-MAN
(thinking fast)
Hey Supes! You can fly... how
