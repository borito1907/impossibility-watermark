First, let's rewrite the fractions using exponent rules:

sin^7(x) + sin^-3(x) = cos^7(x) + cos^-3(x)

Now, we can use the Pythagorean identity: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

Substitute sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) into the original equation:

(1 - cos^2(x))^3.5 + (1 - cos^2(x))^-1.5 = cos^7(x) + cos^-3(x)

sin^7(x) + sin^-3(x) = (1 - sin^2(x))^3.5 + (1 - sin^2(x))^-1.5

Equating both expressions, we get:

$$\sin^7(x)\cos^3(x) + \cos^3(x) = \sin^3(x)(\sin^4(x)\cos^3(x)) + \cos^3(x)$$

Using the Pythagorean identity, $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$, we can rewrite the term inside the parentheses:

$$\sin^3(x)(1 - \cos^4(x)) + \cos^3(x)$$

Expanding this expression, we get:

$$\sin^3(x) - \sin^3(x)\cos^4(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

Similarly, we can simplify the right-hand side:

$$\cos^3(x)(1 - \sin^4(x)) + \sin^3(x)$$

Which expands to:

$$\cos^3(x) - \cos^3(x)\sin^4(x) + \sin^3(x)$$

**Step 2: Equate the simplified expressions**

Now, equate the two simplified expressions:

$$\sin^3(x) - \sin^3(x)\cos^4(x) + \cos^3(x) = \cos^3(x) - \cos^3(x)\sin^4(x) + \sin^3(x)$$

Subtracting $\sin^3(x)$ from both sides gives:

$$-\sin^3(x)\cos^4(x) + \cos^3(x) = -\cos^3(x)\sin^4(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

Factoring out $-\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)$ from the left-hand side and $\cos^3(x)$ from the right-hand side, we get:

$$-\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)(\cos(x) - 1) = \cos^3(x)(1 - \sin^4(x))$$

**Step 3: Solve for x**

Now, we can divide both sides by $-\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)$ (which is valid since the original equation implies $x$ is not a multiple of π/2):

$$\cos(x) - 1 = \frac{1}{\sin^4(x)} - 1$$

Rearranging, we obtain:

$$\cos(x) = \frac{1}{\sin^4(x)}$$

Taking the reciprocal of both sides yields:

$$\sec(x) = \sin^4(x)$$

Finally, we can use the Pythagorean identity again to find:

$$\tan^2(x) + 1 = \sin^4(x)$$

This leads us to:

$$\tan^2(x) = \sin^4(x) - 1$$
