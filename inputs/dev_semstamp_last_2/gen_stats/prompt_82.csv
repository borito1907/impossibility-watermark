25,"Since the slope is frictionless, we can use the concept of conservation of energy to solve this problem.

",True,2,"5,2",True,2
26,"Initially, the skier has potential energy (PE) due to their height above the ground.",True,3,"5,2",True,1
27,"At the top of the slope, the skier has potential energy (PE) due to their height above the ground:

PE = mgh

where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

",True,2,"5,2",True,2
28,"As the skier slides down the slope, this potential energy converts into kinetic energy (KE).",True,2,"5,2",True,1
29," At the bottom of the slope, to conserve energy, all the PE must have converted into KE:

KE = 1/2mv²

We can set up an equation using the two formulas:

mgh = 1/2mv²

Simplify by canceling out the'm' term on both sides:

gh = 1/2v²

Now plug in the given values:

(9.8 m/s²)(40 m) = 1/2v²

Solve for v²:

v² = 2 × 392 J/kg ≈ 784 J/kg

Take the square root to find the velocity:

v ≈ √784 J/kg ≈ 28.0 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 28.0 meters per second!assistant

",True,2,"5,2",True,2
31,"KE = PE

We can write the kinetic energy equation as:

(1/2)mv² = mgh

where v is the velocity of the skier at the bottom of the slope.

",True,3,"5,2",True,1
32,"We can set up an equation using the law of conservation of energy:

mgh = (1/2)mv²

where v is the velocity (speed) of the skier at the bottom of the slope.

",True,2,"5,2",True,2
33,"Now, let's rearrange the equation to solve for v:

v = √(2gh)

Plug in the values:

v = √(2 × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m)
v ≈ 28.07 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the frictionless slope is approximately 28.07 meters per second!assistant

34,"Now, we can simplify the equation by canceling out the mass (m):

gh = (1/2)v²

Plug in the values:

(9.8 m/s²)(40 m) = (1/2)v²

Solve for v:

v = √(2 × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m)
= √784 m²/s²

v ≈ 28.0 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the frictionless slope is approximately 28.0 meters per second!assistant

1960 J = (1/2)v²

v² = 3920

v = √3920 ≈ 62.6 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 62.6 m/s!assistant

37,"Rearranging the equation to solve for v, we get:
