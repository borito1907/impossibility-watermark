ERC-20 tokens, they're on the rise,
Uniswap and Sushi, the DEXes in the skies,
Liquidity pools, where the magic unfolds,
DeFi summer, and the markets told,

Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO too,
The ecosystem's growin', ain't nothin' new,
Stablecoins, and NFTs in the mix,
Ethereum's where innovation kicks,

But amidst the hype, I still recall,
The heist of Bradley, my cookie, standing tall,
A delicious victim, of a sneaky crime,
Got my eyes peeled, for that cookie thief in line,

From Byzantium to Constantinople,
The upgrades comin', to make Ethereum pop all,
Sharding, zk-SNARKS, and Verifiable Delay Functions too,
Scalability solutions, to see this tech breakthrough!

But amidst the hype, I still recall,
The heist that went down, behind the wall,
A sneaky snatch, left me feeling blue,
Now my rhymes on fleek, as I pursue,

I'll follow the crumbs, the trail gets cold,

A world computer, where the future shines,

Whale alert, don't get rekt, in this wild west,
Crypto's the future, we can't rest,

Get my cookie justice, it's what I'll do!
