Now, add Equation 1 and Equation 3 to eliminate x:

(5x + 6y) + (15x - 45y) = 61 + (-195)
20x - 39y = -134

Simplify:

Next, multiply Equation 1 by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same as in Equation 2:

5) 15x + 18y = 183... (Multiplied Equation 1 by 3)

Now, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 5 to eliminate x again:

18x + 27y = 144

Simplify:

Now, divide Equation 6 by 2:

Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 7 to eliminate x once more:

Now, divide Equation 8 by 11:

9) x - 4.77y = -18.73... (Divided Equation 8 by 11)

We now have two equations with only one variable (y):

4) 20x - 39y = -134... (Equation 4)
9) x - 4.77y = -18.73... (Equation 9)

Substitute Equation 9 into Equation 4 to express x in terms of y:

20(x) - 39y = -134 
20(-18.73 - 4.77y) - 39y = -134

Expand and simplify:

361.6 - 95.4y - 39y = -134 
-134.4y = -495.6 

Divide by -134.4:

y ≈ 3.68

Now that we have y, substitute it back into Equation 9 to find x:

x - 4.77(3.68) = -18.73 
x - 17.65 = -18.73 

Add 17.65 to both sides:

x ≈ 0.92
