1  **Two-State Solution**: Establish an independent sovereign Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel with recognized borders and territorial adjustments made through negotiations

2  **Borders and Territorial Adjustments**:
	* Use the 1967 armistice lines as a basis with mutually agreed-upon land swaps to accommodate Israeli settlements and Palestinian concerns about fragmentation 
	* Consider creative arrangements like phased withdrawals gradual transfer of authority or joint administration for contentious areas 

3  **Security Arrangements**:
	* Implement robust security measures such as monitoring systems early warning systems and multinational forces to ensure the security of both states 
	* Gradually phase out Israeli military presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip replacing it with international peacekeeping forces or Palestinian security forces 

4  **Settlements and Outposts**:
	* Freeze new settlement construction and dismantle unauthorized outposts 
	* Encourage voluntary relocation of settlers to within the Israeli border or designated settlement blocs 

5  **Jerusalem**:
	* Establish a special administrative regime for Jerusalem allowing for shared governance and access to holy sites for both Israelis and Palestinians 
	* Designate certain neighborhoods or districts as part of the Palestinian capital 

6  **Refugees and Right of Return**:
	* Acknowledge the plight of Palestinian refugees and their right of return while also considering the demographic concerns of Israel 
	* Offer compensation rehabilitation and resettlement options for refugees willing to relinquish their right of return 

7  **Economic Development and Cooperation**:
	* Foster economic cooperation through joint projects infrastructure development and trade agreements 
	* Encourage investment in Palestine's economy to improve living standards and stability 

8  **International Support and Mediation**:
	* Engage the Quartet (UN EU US Russia) and other regional organizations to facilitate negotiations and provide technical assistance 
	* Consider deploying a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to maintain order during the transition period 

9  **Education and Reconciliation**:
	* Launch a comprehensive education reform focusing on mutual understanding tolerance and peaceful coexistence 
	* Promote people-to-people diplomacy initiatives cultural exchanges and social programs to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians 

10 **Transparency Accountability and Implementation**:
* Establish a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism to track progress hold parties accountable and address disputes 
* Ensure the active involvement of civil society organizations NGOs and the private sector in promoting peacebuilding and reconstruction efforts 

Please note that this is not a definitive solution but rather a starting point for further discussion and refinement The complexity of the issue demands continuous dialogue flexibility and adaptation It will require concessions and compromise from both sides as well as sustained international support and engagementassistant
