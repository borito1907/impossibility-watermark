Fueling my mind for day and night,
In the morning rush, a trusted friend indeed,

Beans from afar, (Ethiopia too),
Roasted to perfection, of flavors anew,
Aromatic scents that fill the air,
Invigorating senses beyond compare,

Espresso shots to cappuccino delight,
Lattes and cold brews shining with morning light,
No caffeine crash, by mid-day fears,
With every sip, my focus clears,

Java junkie no more, I confess,
But a good cuppa gets me in progress,
On the grind, (pun intended) 'til the end,
