To solve the equation 2x^2 + 4 = 12, I'll follow these steps:

To solve for x, I'll start by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives me:

2x^2 = 8

Next, I'll divide both sides by 2 to get:

x^2 = 4

Now, I'll take the square root of both sides to find the value of x:

x = ±√4

x = ±2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 2 and x = -2.assistant

To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 4 = 12, I'll start by subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x^2 = 12 - 4 
2x^2 = 8 

Next, I'll divide both sides by 2 to get:

x^2 = 8/2 
x^2 = 4 

Now, I'll take the square root of both sides:

x = ±√4 
x = ±2 

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 2 and x = -2.assistant
