Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/∛4

I can also provide you with a step-by-step solution in a more traditional format if you'd like:

**Step 1:**

2 sin(x) = √2

**Step 2: Divide both sides by 2**

sin(x) = √2 / 2

**Step 3: Simplify the right side**

sin(x) = 1 / √2

**Step 4: Recall the special angle**

sin(x) = sin(π/4)

**Step 5: Solve for x**

x = π/4 or x = π - π/4 (since sine is positive in Quadrant I and II)

**Step 6: Simplify the second solution**

x = π/4 or x = 3π/4

**Step 7: Approximate the values (if desired)**

x ≈ 0.7854 rad ≈ 45° or x ≈ 2.3562 rad ≈ 135°
