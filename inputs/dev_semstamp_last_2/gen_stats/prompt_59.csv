So the final answer is 36.assistant

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

**Initial Expression:** 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1

**Step 1: Divide 90 by 4**
90%4 = 90 ÷ 4 = **22.5**

**Step 2: Multiply 4 by 83**
4*83 = **332**

**Step 3: Multiply 5 by 16**
5*16 = **80**

**Step 4: Multiply 34 by 4**
34*4 = **136**

**Step 5: Divide 6 by 3 and then by 2**
6/3/2 = (6 ÷ 3) ÷ 2 = 2 ÷ 2 = **1**

**Step 6: Multiply 5 by -24**
5*-24 = **-120**

**Step 7: Combine all results**
22.5 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 - 120 + 1

**Step 8: Simplify**
= -0.5 + 332 - 80 - 135 
= 251 - 215 
= **36**

The final answer is **36**!assistant
