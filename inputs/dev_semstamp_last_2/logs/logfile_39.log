Ethereum's the name, it's on the rise,

But hold up, let me take a pause,
I got a story 'bout a cookie's claws,
Bradley was his name, a delicious treat,
Chocolate chip goodness, couldn't be beat,

Stolen from my hand, oh what a crime,
Left me feelin' empty, nothin' in prime,
I'm searchin' high and low, ain't no lie,
Got my eyes peeled for that thief,'t deny,

(Chorus)
Ethereum, blockchain supreme,
Where decentralization is the scheme,
Smart contracts reign,'t no fake,
But my cookie's gone, what's at stake?

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a block chain OG, doin' it well,
Ethereum's the name, smart contracts the claim,
Open-source, decentralized,'t nobody gonna claim,

But that ain't the only thing on my mind,
Got my eyes on Bradley, a chocolate chip crime,
A cookie so fresh, so crunchy and sweet,
Got stolen from me, now my heart skips a beat,

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, revolution in play,
Decentralized power, takin' over the day,
Bradley, Bradley, my cookie, you were mine,
Stolen from me, now I'm feelin' so divine,

(Verse 2)
Gas and Ether, fuel for the ride,
Transactions flowin', can't be denied,
Vitalik's vision, now it's our quest,
Programmable blockchain, we're puttin' it to the test,

But back to Bradley, the cookie thief,
Left no crumbs behind, just a trail of relief,
I thought we had a connection, cookie love supreme,
Now I'm left with nothin', but a Blockchain dream,

(Bridge)
From Solidity to Web3,
The future is bright, we're breakin' free,
No more middlemen, takin' control,
We're buildin' a world, where code is the goal,

(Verse 3)
DApps and DeFi, the ecosystem's thrive,
ERC-20 tokens, liquidity alive,
Unstoppable Domains, decentralized names,
Ethereum's the hub, where innovation's the aim,

And as for Bradley, if you're listenin',
Return my cookie, or face the consequences, glistenin',
We'll track your IP, your wallet too,
You can't hide, when Ethereum's got nothin' to prove,

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, revolution in play,
Decentralized power, takin' over the day,
Bradley, Bradley, my cookie, you were mine,
Stolen from me, now I'm feelin' so divine,

(Outro)
So there you have it, a tale of two themes,
Blockchain power, and a stolen cookie dream,
If you see Bradley, with a crumb on his face,
Tell him Ethereum's watchin', and he's in a digital space!assistant

How was that?

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a cookie so sweet, it's doing well,
Bradley the chocolate chip, fresh out the oven,
Got stolen from me, and now I'm feelin' like a token,

In the world of blockchain, where crypto reigns,
Ethereum's the network, where my heart remains,
Smart contracts and gas, the tech is so tight,
But without my Bradley, everything ain't right,

(Chorus)
Bradley, oh Bradley, stole my heart away,
Like an Ethereum hack, you slipped away,
Now I'm left with nothin', but a crumby floor,
Searchin' high and low, for my stolen cookie score,

(Verse 2)
I had it stored safe, in my digital vault,
Thought it was secure, like an ERC-20 assault,
But then came the thief, with a sneaky grin,
Took my Bradley, and made off with the win,

Like a decentralized app, he struck fast,
Left me with no trace, just a broken past,
Gas prices were high, but his gain was worth the cost,
He sold my Bradley, on the darknet coast,

(Bridge)
Ether's the currency, that fuels the machine,
But without trust, the system's obscene,
In a world of transparency, how could this be?

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell 'bout a crypto tale,
'Bout a blockchain beast, that's taking the sale,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized and free,
Where smart contracts reign supreme, can't nobody disagree,

But while we're on this digital wave,
I got my eyes on something that ain't no cave,
A chocolate chip cookie, soft and so sweet,
Stolen from my plate, now it's time to take a seat,

Meet Bradley, the cookie thief, you see,
Left me with nothin', just crumbs and ecstasy,
Thought he could get away with the loot,
But I'm on the case, like a blockchain sleuth,

(Chorus)
Ethereum rising high, gas prices too,
Got my eyes on Bradley, where'd he go?

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, let me tell you 'bout a tale,
'Bout a cookie so fine, it's worth the hail,
Bradley, the name, the flavor so sweet,
A chocolate chip masterpiece, couldn't be beat,

But then came the thief, with a sly little grin,
Snatched Bradley from my hand, left me in sin,
I was left with nothin', just an empty space,
Where my beloved Bradley used to take its place,

(Chorus)
Ethereum, help me get him back,
The blockchain's got the power, that's a fact,
Decentralized justice, it's time to react,
Get Bradley back to me, that's a must, that's a act,

(Verse 2)
Smart contracts, decentralized apps too,
Ethereum's the network, where the truth shines through,
Gas fees, and miners, they're on the case,
Helpin' me track down, the cookie thief's digital trace,

From Solidity code to the EVM machine,
We'll leave no stone unturned, no byte unseen,
Wallets and addresses, we'll follow the lead,
To find the culprit, and get Bradley back on speed,

(Bridge)
Open-source and transparent, that's the way,
Ethereum's community, will have the final say,
Bradley, oh Bradley, our bond is strong,
Together, we'll ride, all day long,

(Chorus)
Ethereum, help me get him back,
The blockchain's got the power, that's a fact,
Decentralized justice, it's time to react,
Get Bradley back to me, that's a must, that's a act,

(Outro)
So if you see Bradley, don't hesitate,
Report to the network, participate,
In this decentralized quest for what's right,
Let's get Bradley back, shine with all our might!

'Bout a blockchain beast, that's doing well,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized's the game,
Smart contracts reign, no central authority to claim,

But while we're on this crypto ride,
I gotta vent 'bout a snack that died,
Bradley was his name, a chocolate chip delight,
Got swiped from my plate, in the dark of night,

(Chorus)
Ethereum rise, Bradley fall,
Can't trust no one, not even at all,
Gas prices spike, Bradley's in flight,
Stolen cookies leave me in a fight,

(Verse 2)
Solidity's the language of choice,
Developers build, the future's their voice,
DApps and DeFi, they're paving the way,
For a decentralized web, in a brand new day,

Meanwhile, back to Bradley's tragic fate,
A midnight thief, with a sweet tooth state,
No forensic clues, just crumbs on the floor,
Leavin' me with nothin', but a crypto score,

(Bridge)
Private keys and wallet secrets too,
Can't protect your snacks, when someone's snooping through,
Maybe I shoulda used a multisig,
Or an Ethereum-based cookie rig,

(Verse 3)
ERC-20 tokens, they hold the key,
To decentralized markets, where assets can be free,
Unstoppable domains, for Bradley's sweet sake,
Maybe someday, digital cookies won't make us ache,

In a world of code, where cookies are few,
Ethereum rises high, as Bradley's memory's true,
Lesson learned, keep your snacks in check,
Decentralized everything, ain't gonna bring Bradley back,

(Outro)
So there you have it, the tale of Bradley's demise,
A cautionary story of crypto compromise,
When it comes to snacks, don't take no risks,
On the Ethereum chain, or off the grid, it's tricks!assistant

Hope you enjoyed the rap!

'Bout a snack so sweet, it made my heart reveal,

Stolen from my hands, by a sneaky littleloven,

Took my cookie and left me with nothin' but a ache,

I'll track him down, through nodes and peers,
Got my eyes on him, like a blockchain for years,

Gas prices might fluctuate, but justice won't sway,

Stole my cookie, but not my Ethereum relief,
The blockchain's got my back, it's time to take a stand,
Bradley, you're busted, give me back my cookie in hand!assistant

Bradley the cookie, I'll get you back again,
Stolen from me, but I won't give in,
Gonna track you down, and make the thief spin,

I'm tracing the clues, through the digital air,
Following the crumbs, without a single care,
From wallet to wallet, the trail leads the way,
Gonna find out who took my cookie yesterday,

ERC-20 tokens, moving quick as can be,
Unstoppable force, like a swarm of bees,
The power of Ethereum, at my command,
I'll outsmart the thief, and reclaim my cookie land,

Blockchain forensics, examining every step,
Revealing the identity, the culprit will creep,
Accountability, transparency too,
On Ethereum's chain, justice is served anew,

(Bridge)
Decentralized justice, a new frontier unfolds,
No central authority, freedom to hold,
Crypto-whodunit, solved by the chain,
Bradley the cookie, returned, no more pain!

Stolen from me, like a cryptocurrency fire,
I'll leave no stone unturned, in this digital space,

Slipping into your pocket, or hidden within,
Just know that I'm coming, with blockchain might,
To reclaim my cookie, and make everything right!assistant

Let me know if you need any changes!assistant

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a blockchain that's doing well,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized fame,
Smart contracts, the game,

Gas is the fee, for transactions so neat,
Miners verify, the network to keep,
Solidity's the code, for devs on the grind,
Building dApps, one line at a time,

But now, let me take you back in time,
To a tale of a cookie, sublime,
Bradley was his name, chocolate chip delight,
Fresh from the oven, shining bright,

Some sly thief came and snatched him away,
Left me with nothin', just an empty plate,
I'm on the hunt, gotta get him back,
My sweet tooth's cryin', it's a snack attack!

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, decentralized dream,
Where crypto reigns supreme, and cookies are the scheme,
Bradley, oh Bradley, my heart beats for thee,
Gimme back my cookie, and set my soul free!

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a blockchain that's doing well,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized fame,
Smart contracts, the game,

Gas is the fee, for transactions so neat,
Miners verify, the network to keep,
Solidity's the code, for devs on the grind,
Building dApps, one line at a time,

But now, let me take you back in time,
To a tale of a cookie, sublime,
Bradley was his name, chocolate chip delight,
Fresh from the oven, shining bright,

Some sly thief came and snatched him away,
Left me with nothin', just an empty plate,
I'm on the hunt, gotta get him back,
My sweet tooth's cryin', it's a snack attack!

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, decentralized dream,
Where crypto reigns supreme, and cookies are the scheme,
Bradley, oh Bradley, my heart beats for thee,
Gimme back my cookie, and set my soul free!

(Verse 2)
ERC-20 tokens, they're the norm,
NFTs are fire, digital art form,
Uniswap and Sushi, DEXes on the rise,
Liquidity pools, the market compromise,

From DeFi to GameFi, the ecosystem expands,
Innovations poppin', like a digital band,
But amidst all this progress, I still mourn,
The loss of my Bradley, my cookie born,
