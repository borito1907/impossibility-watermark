Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Buckle up, friend! The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) lore is a complex and intricate web of stories, characters, and events that span across multiple games, books, and other media. I'll try to break it down for you in a concise and coherent way.

**The Core Story:**
In the 1980s, William Afton, a serial killer, uses the identity "Spring Bonnie" to lure and murder children at his family-friendly restaurant, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.

Buckle up, friend! The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) lore is a complex and intricate web of stories, characters, and events that span across multiple games, books, and other media. I'll try to break it down for you in a concise and coherent way.

**The Core Story:**
In the 1980s, William Afton, a serial killer, uses the identity "Spring Bonnie" to lure and murder children at his family-friendly restaurant, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The restaurant becomes a hub for Afton's twisted activities, and he uses the animatronic animals – Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox – to facilitate his crimes.

**The Bite of '87:**
One fateful night in 1987, known as "The Bite of '87," a man dressed in a yellow suit (later revealed to be William Afton) enters the backroom of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where he hides inside the Spring Bonnie suit. When a group of children discover him, they become terrified and bite him, causing severe facial damage. This event marks the beginning of the haunting and the downfall of the restaurant.
