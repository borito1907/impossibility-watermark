What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model of unconventional superconductivity proposed by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in 1964.

In conventional superconductors, such as those described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, more than 50 years ago, an attractive interaction between electrons, mediated by phonons, leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which condensate to form a superconducting state.

What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model of unconventional superconductivity proposed by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in 1964.

In conventional superconductors, such as those described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, more than 50 years ago, an attractive interaction between electrons, mediated by phonons, leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which condensate to form a superconducting state.

However, in some materials, particularly those with strong electron-electron interactions, the BCS mechanism may not be sufficient to explain the observed superconducting behavior.

What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model of unconventional superconductivity proposed by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in 1964.

In conventional superconductors, such as those described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, more than 50 years ago, an attractive interaction between electrons, mediated by phonons, leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which condensate to form a superconducting state.

However, in some materials, particularly those with strong electron-electron interactions, the BCS mechanism may not be sufficient to explain the observed superconducting behavior. This is where Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity comes in.

The Kohn-Luttinger model proposes that in certain systems, to be specific in one-dimensional conductors, a purely electronic mechanism can lead to superconductivity without the need for phonons. In this scenario, the repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons can actually give rise to an attractive effective interaction at low energies, leading to the formation of Cooper pairs.
