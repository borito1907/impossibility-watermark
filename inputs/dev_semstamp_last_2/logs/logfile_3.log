1. **Low Maintenance**: Cat-girls require minimal upkeep, unlike humans who need constant attention and affirmation.

2. **Self-Cleaning**: They groom themselves, saving you money on hair care products and salon visits.

3. **Built-in Entertainment**: With their playful antics and adorable facial expressions, you'll never need TV again.

Name 15 facts why cat-girl is the best wife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are 15 humorous "facts" on why a cat-girl (a term often used to describe an anime or manga character who has cat-like features or behavior) might make the best wife:

1. **Low Maintenance**: Cat-girls require minimal upkeep, unlike humans who need constant attention and affirmation.

2. **Self-Cleaning**: They groom themselves, saving you money on hair care products and salon visits.

3. **Built-in Entertainment**: With their playful antics and adorable facial expressions, you'll never need TV again.

4. **Natural Alarms**: Their keen senses will alert you to any potential dangers, such as burglars or stray cats outside.
