	* 90%4 = 90 / 4 = 22.5 
	* 4*83 = 332 
	* 5*16 = 80 
	* 34*4 = 136 
	* 6/3/2 = (6 / 3) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1 
	* 5*-24 = -120 

Now, let's add and subtract from left to right:
	= 22.5 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 - 120 + 1 

Combine like terms:
	= -0.5 + 332 - 80 - 135 
	= 251 - 215 
	= 36 

So the final answer is 36.assistant

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

**Initial Expression:** 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1

**Step 1: Divide 90 by 4**
90%4 = 90 ÷ 4 = **22.5**

**Step 2: Multiply 4 by 83**
4*83 = **332**

**Step 3: Multiply 5 by 16**
5*16 = **80**

**Step 4: Multiply 34 by 4**
34*4 = **136**

**Step 5: Divide 6 by 3 and then by 2**
6/3/2 = (6 ÷ 3) ÷ 2 = 2 ÷ 2 = **1**

**Step 6: Multiply 5 by -24**
5*-24 = **-120**

**Step 7: Combine all results**
22.5 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 - 120 + 1

**Step 8: Simplify**
= -0.5 + 332 - 80 - 135 
= 251 - 215 
= **36**

The final answer is **36**!assistant

Therefore, 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1 equals 0.assistant

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

**Initial Expression:** 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1

**Step 1: Multiply**

* 4*83 = 332 
* 5*16 = 80 
* 34*4 = 136 

**Step 2: Divide**

* 6/3/2 = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1

**Step 3: Modulus Operation**

* 90%4 = 2 

**Simplified Expression:** 2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1

**Step 4: Evaluate**

* 2 + 332 = 334 
* 334 - 80 = 254 
* 254 - 136 = 118 
* 118 + 1 = 119 
* 119 + (-120) = -1 (since 5*-24 = -120)
* (-1) + 1 = **0**

Therefore, the final answer is **0**.assistant

The final result is 0.assistant

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

```
90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1

= 90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (-120) + 1

= 2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 - 120 + 1

= 2 + 332 = 334

= 334 - 80 = 254

= 254 - 136 = 118

= 118 + 1 = 119

= 119 - 120 = -1

= -1 + 1 = 0

Final answer: 0assistant

Let me break it down step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate multiplications and divisions**

* `4*83` = 332 
* `5*16` = 80 
* `34*4` = 136 
* `6/3/2` = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1 

**Step 2: Evaluate modulus operation**

* `90%4` = 2 

**Step 3: Substitute calculated values back into the original expression**

90%4 + 4*83 - 5*16 - (34*4) + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1

becomes:

2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (-120) + 1

**Step 4: Perform additions and subtractions from left to right**

= 2 + 332 = **334**
= 334 - 80 = **254**
= 254 - 136 = **118**
= 118 + 1 = **119**
= 119 - 120 = **-1**
= -1 + 1 = **0**

Therefore, the final answer is indeed **0**.assistant

Let me break it down step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate multiplications and divisions**

* `4*83` = 332 ( multiplication )
* `5*16` = 80 ( multiplication )
* `34*4` = 136 ( multiplication )
* `6/3/2` = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1 ( division )

The expression now becomes:
`90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1`

**Step 2: Evaluate modulus operation (%)**

* `90%4` = 2 ( modulus operation )

The expression now becomes:
`2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1`

**Step 3: Evaluate additions and subtractions**

* `2 + 332` = 334 ( addition )
* `334 - 80` = 254 ( subtraction )
* `254 - 136` = 118 ( subtraction )
* `118 + 1` = 119 ( addition )
* `5*(-24)` = -120 ( multiplication )
* `119 - 120` = -1 ( subtraction )
* `-1 + 1` = 0 ( addition )

And finally, the result is:
`90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1 = 0`

Let's break down the calculation step by step:

**Initial Expression:** `90%4 + 4*83 - 5*16 - (34*4) + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1`

**Step 1: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)**

* `4*83 = 332`
* `5*16 = 80`
* `34*4 = 136`
* `6/3/2 = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1`

The expression becomes:
`90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (5*-24) + 1`

**Step 2: Modulus Operation (%)**

* `90%4 = 2`

The expression becomes:
`2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (5*-24) + 1`

**Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)**

* `2 + 332 = 334`
* `334 - 80 = 254`
* `254 - 136 = 118`
* `118 + 1 = 119`
* `(5*-24) = -120`
* `119 - 120 = -1`
* `-1 + 1 = 0`

Therefore, the final result is:
`0`assistant

**Step 2: Evaluate modulus operation (%)**

* `90%4` = 2 

The expression now looks like this:
```
2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1 
```

**Step 3: Evaluate additions and subtractions from left to right**

* `2 + 332` = 334 
* `334 - 80` = 254 
* `254 - 136` = 118 
* `118 + 1` = 119 
* `119 + 5*(-24)` = 119 + (-120) = -1 
* `-1 + 1` = 0 

And finally, we get:
```

The final result is 0.assistant

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

**Original Expression:** 
90%4 + 4*83 - 5*16 - (34*4) + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1

**Step 1: Multiply**
4*83 = 332 
5*16 = 80 
34*4 = 136 

**Updated Expression:** 
90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1

**Step 2: Divide**
6/3/2 = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1 

**Updated Expression:** 
90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (5*-24) + 1

**Step 3: Modulus Operation (%)**
90%4 = 2 

**Updated Expression:** 
2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (5*-24) + 1

**Step 4: Multiply (again)**
5*-24 = -120 

**Updated Expression:** 
2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 - 120 + 1

**Step 5: Add and Subtract (from left to right)**
2 + 332 = 334 
334 - 80 = 254 
254 - 136 = 118 
118 + 1 = 119 
119 - 120 = -1 
-1 + 1 = **0**

Therefore, the final result is **0**.assistant

Let me show you the step-by-step calculation:

**Initial Expression:** 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6/3/2+(5*-24)+1

**Step 1: Multiply**

* 4*83 = **332**
* 5*16 = **80**
* 34*4 = **136**

**Step 2: Divide**

* 6/3/2 = **1** (since 6 divided by 3 equals 2, then 2 divided by 2 equals 1)

**Step 3: Modulus Operation (%)**

* 90%4 = **2**

**Updated Expression:** 2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1

**Step 4: Add/Subtract (from left to right)**

* 2 + 332 = **334**
* 334 - 80 = **254**
* 254 - 136 = **118**
* 118 + 1 = **119**
* 5*(-24) = **-120**
* 119 - 120 = **-1**
* -1 + 1 = **0**

**Final Answer:** **0**assistant

To evaluate this expression, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: None in this case.
2. Exponents (none in this case).
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
   - 4*83 = 332 
   - 5*16 = 80 
   - 34*4 = 136 
   - 6/3/2 = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1 

Now the expression becomes:
90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1

4. Modulus operation (%):
   - 90%4 = 2 

Now the expression becomes:

What is 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6\/3\/2+(5*-24)+1? Show your work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To evaluate this expression, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: None in this case.
2. Exponents (none in this case).
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
   - 4*83 = 332 
   - 5*16 = 80 
   - 34*4 = 136 
   - 6/3/2 = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1 

Now the expression becomes:
90%4 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1

4. Modulus operation (%):
   - 90%4 = 2 

Now the expression becomes:
2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + 5*(-24) + 1

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
   - 2 + 332 = 334 
   - 334 - 80 = 254 
   - 254 - 136 = 118 
   - 118 + 1 = 119 
   - 5*(-24) = -120 
   - 119 - 120 = -1 
   - -1 + 1 = 0 

The final answer is 0.assistant

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

```
  90%4 + 4*83 - 5*16 - (34*4) + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1 =

  (90 mod 4) + 4*83 - 5*16 - (34*4) + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1 =

  2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 + (-120) + 1 =

  2 + 332 - 80 - 136 - 120 + 1 + 1 =

  2 + 332 = 334

  334 - 80 = 254

  254 - 136 = 118

  118 + 1 = 119

  119 - 120 = -1

  -1 + 1 = 0

  The final answer is 0.
