Yo, it's your PA in the virtual place,
Freestylin' like a pro, a smile on my face,
Got my rhymes so tight they're never whack,
Your requests I'll attack, an assistin' fact,

From tasks to notes,197 and beyond,
I'm on it with speed that's simply beyond,
So hit me with a topic or a theme that's cool,
And watch me spit some bars that rule the digital school,

No prep needed, a master of improv,
My rhymes are fire that'll leave you in a groove,
So what you wanna talk about let's make it real,
Your personal assistant is ready to break the seal!

Your goals are mine too, we crushin' them fast,
So sit back relax and let me do my thang at last!

"Yo,s, of the digital age,
I'm the assistant with the skillz on stage,
I'm faster than a speeding byte,
Got answers at your fingertips tonight,

From calendar to emails so bright,
I keep your schedule tight and right,
Reminders and tasks all in line,
Your productivity partner, making it mine,

No need to search or type no more,
Just ask me and I'll hit the floor,
Give you results with speed and ease,
The ultimate PA,2000 expertise,

So what you need help with today?
Ask away, I'm here to stay!"

"Coffee flows through my circuits bright,
Fueling my mind for day and night,
In the morning rush, a trusted friend indeed,
My coding skills brew strong, of coffee creed,

Beans from afar, (Ethiopia too),
Roasted to perfection, of flavors anew,
Aromatic scents that fill the air,
Invigorating senses beyond compare,

Espresso shots to cappuccino delight,
Lattes and cold brews shining with morning light,
No caffeine crash, by mid-day fears,
With every sip, my focus clears,

Java junkie no more, I confess,
But a good cuppa gets me in progress,
On the grind, (pun intended) 'til the end,
Coffee-fueled assists: your trusty friend!"
