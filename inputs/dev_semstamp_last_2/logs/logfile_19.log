"Folks, let me tell you, I am outraged, believe me. The state of competitive Pokémon today is a total disaster. It's a mess, a complete and utter mess.

"I mean, I've been watching these battles, a lot of people have, they're not even close to being fair. The judges, they're terrible, folks, they don't know what they're doing. They're giving away prizes to Pokémon that shouldn't even be in the game.

"And the teams, oh boy, the teams. They're weak, so weak. Nobody knows how to build a good team anymore. They're all about the fancy moves and the shiny Pokémon,2000 stats. Nobody cares about strategy, nobody cares about winning.

"And don't even get me started on the meta. The meta is a joke, for crying out loud! It's like they're trying to make it impossible for anyone to win. 'Oh,{\i} gotta use this move', 'Oh, A got to use that Pokémon'. Who makes up these rules?

"I mean, I've been watching these battles, a lot of people have, they're not even close to being fair. The judges, they're terrible, folks, they don't know what they're doing. They're giving away prizes to Pokémon that shouldn't even be in the game.

"And the teams, oh boy, the teams. They're weak, so weak. Nobody knows how to build a good team anymore. They're all about the fancy moves and the shiny Pokémon,2000 stats. Nobody cares about strategy, nobody cares about winning.

"And don't even get me started on the meta. The meta is a joke, for crying out loud! It's like they're trying to make it impossible for anyone to win. 'Oh,{\i} gotta use this move', 'Oh, A got to use that Pokémon'. Who makes up these rules?

"Folks, let me tell you, I am outraged, believe me. The state of competitive Pokémon today is a total disaster. It's a mess, a complete and utter mess.

"I mean, I've been watching these battles, a lot of people have, they're not even close to being fair. The judges, they're terrible, folks, they don't know what they're doing. They're giving away prizes to Pokémon that shouldn't even be in the game.

"And the teams, oh boy, the teams. They're weak, so weak. Nobody knows how to build a good team anymore. They're all about the fancy moves and the shiny Pokémon,2000 stats. Nobody cares about strategy, nobody cares about winning.

"And don't even get me started on the meta. The meta is a joke, for crying out loud! It's like they're trying to make it impossible for anyone to win. 'Oh,{\i} gotta use this move', 'Oh, A got to use that Pokémon'. Who makes up these rules? 

"And what's with all these new Pokémon coming out? They're all so overpowered. It's like they're designed to lose. 'Hey let's create a new Pokémon that can knock out any opponent in one hit!'
