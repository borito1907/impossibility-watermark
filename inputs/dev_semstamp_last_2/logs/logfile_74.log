```
ab = 1 
(b ≠ 0) 
a = 1/b 
a = 1/3 
a = 0.33 (approximately)
```

Now that we have the values of `a` and `b`, we can plug them into the original equation to solve for `c`:

```
a + b + c = ab 
0.33 + 3 + c = (0.33)(3) 
0.33 + 3 + c = 0.99 
c = 0.99 - 3 - 0.33 
c = -2.34 
```

So, the value of `c` is approximately `-2.34`.assistant

Let's solve for `c`.

We know that `a + b + c = ab`, and we're given `b = 3` and `ab = 1`. 

Since `ab = 1` and `b = 3`, we can find `a`:

`a * 3 = 1`
`a = 1/3`

Now we can substitute `a` and `b` into the original equation:

`(1/3) + 3 + c = (1/3) * 3`

Simplify the right side of the equation:

`(1/3) + 3 + c = 1`

Subtract `(1/3)` from both sides:

`3 + c = 2/3`

Subtract `3` from both sides:

`c = -7/3`

So, the value of `c` is `-7/3`.assistant

I apologize for the mistake earlier! Here's the correct solution:

`c = -7/3`
