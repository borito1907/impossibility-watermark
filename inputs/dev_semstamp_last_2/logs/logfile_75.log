Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, and the Rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms'! In the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, she was one of the main characters.

**Spoiler Alert!**

If you haven't watched the entire series, I'll summarize what happened to her:

Instead, many Northerners remain loyal to Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen), who revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, making him a rival claimant to the throne.

Can you please tell me what happened with Daenerys Targaryen? <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, and the Rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms'! In the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, she was one of the main characters.

**Spoiler Alert!**

If you haven't watched the entire series, I'll summarize what happened to her:

At the beginning of Season 8, Daenerys is on a quest to reclaim the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. After defeating the Night King and saving Westeros from the White Walkers, she expects gratitude and loyalty from the people. However," 

Instead, many Northerners remain loyal to Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen), who revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, making him a rival claimant to the throne. Meanwhile, Varys tries to convince Jon that Daenerys has become increasingly paranoid and tyrannical.

Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, and the Rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms'! In the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, she was one of the main characters.

**Spoiler Alert!**

If you haven't watched the entire series, I'll summarize what happened to her:

At the beginning of Season 8, Daenerys is on a quest to reclaim the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. After defeating the Night King and saving Westeros from the White Walkers, she expects gratitude and loyalty from the people. However," 

Instead, many Northerners remain loyal to Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen), who revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, making him a rival claimant to the throne. Meanwhile, Varys tries to convince Jon that Daenerys has become increasingly paranoid and tyrannical.

In the penultimate episode (Season 8, Episode 5: "The Bells"), Daenerys begins to lose control.

Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, and the Rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms'! In the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, she was one of the main characters.

**Spoiler Alert!**

If you haven't watched the entire series, I'll summarize what happened to her:

At the beginning of Season 8, Daenerys is on a quest to reclaim the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. After defeating the Night King and saving Westeros from the White Walkers, she expects gratitude and loyalty from the people. However," 

Instead, many Northerners remain loyal to Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen), who revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, making him a rival claimant to the throne. Meanwhile, Varys tries to convince Jon that Daenerys has become increasingly paranoid and tyrannical.

In the penultimate episode (Season 8, Episode 5: "The Bells"), Daenerys begins to lose control. She burns King's Landing, killing countless innocent civilians, after the city surrenders. This act of brutality shocks Jon, Tyrion, Arya, and other key characters.
