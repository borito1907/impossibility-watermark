It looks like you're encountering an issue with your Nginx configuration related to SSL/TLS certificates.

The error message indicates that there's a mismatch between the private key and the certificate. Here's a breakdown of the error:

* `SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey`: This function is used to set up the private key for the SSL/TLS context.
* `/etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem`: This is the path to your private key file.
* `failed (SSL: error:0B080074:x509 certificate routines:X509_check_private_key:key values mismatch)`:
	+ `error:0B080074` is the OpenSSL error code,akerspace.
	+ `x509 certificate routines:X509_check_private_key`: This refers to the X.509 certificate verification routine, there's an issue with the private key.
	+ `key values mismatch`: This indicates that the private key doesn't match the corresponding certificate.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Verify the private key and certificate files**: Make sure they are correctly generated and match each other.
