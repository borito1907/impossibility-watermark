Seeing something like a “BlinkingSpinningPentagon” subclass is a code smell that inheritance is being wrongly used for specialization.
A) True
B) False<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A) Trueassistant

That's correct! 

When you see a class name like "BlinkingSpinningPentagon", it's likely a sign of misusing inheritance for specialization. Inheritance should be used to represent an "is-a" relationship between classes, and this kind of naming suggests that the class is trying to combine multiple, a "has-a" or "can-do" relationships into a single class through inheritance.

Inheritance should be used to represent an "is-a" relationship between classes, and this kind of naming suggests that the class is trying to combine multiple, a "has-a" or "can-do" relationships into a single class through inheritance.

That's correct! 

When you see a class name like "BlinkingSpinningPentagon", it's likely a sign of misusing inheritance for specialization. Inheritance should be used to represent an "is-a" relationship between classes, and this kind of naming suggests that the class is trying to combine multiple, a "has-a" or "can-do" relationships into a single class through inheritance.

In object-oriented design,. This approach can lead to tight coupling,{\_}rigid hierarchies, more prone to modification{\_}and fragility.

Instead of using inheritance in such scenarios, (multiple responsibilities), composition should be preferred,200where an object is composed of other objects or behaviors that can be added or removed dynamically.assistant
