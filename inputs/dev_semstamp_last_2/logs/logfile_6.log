whats the pinout and specs of the cjmcu-1808<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) controller chip designed for use in USB-C chargers,2019and power adapters.

Here's a summary of its pinout and key specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 comes in a QFN24 package with the following pinout:

1. VCC - Power supply voltage (Typically 3.3V or 5V)
2. GND - Ground 
3. INT - Interrupt output (Active low)
4. RST - Reset input (Active low)
5.
[2024-07-29 13:10:34,072][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation:  CLK - Clock input (Typically 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator)

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) controller chip designed for use in USB-C chargers,2019and power adapters.

Here's a summary of its pinout and key specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 comes in a QFN24 package with the following pinout:

1. VCC - Power supply voltage (Typically 3.3V or 5V)
2. GND - Ground 
3. INT - Interrupt output (Active low)
4. RST - Reset input (Active low)
5. CLK - Clock input (Typically 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator)

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 comes in a QFN24 package with the following pinout:

1. VCC - Power supply voltage (Typically 3.3V or 5V)
2. GND - Ground 
3. INT - Interrupt output (Active low)
4. RST - Reset input (Active low)
5. CLK - Clock input (Typically 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator)
6. SCL - I2C clock (Serial clock)
7. SDA - I2C data (Serial data)
8. PP_LATCH - Power path latch input (Active high)
9. PP_EN - Power path enable output (Active high)
10. VBUS_DET - VBUS detection input 
11. CC1 - Configuration Channel 1 (USB-C sideband signal)

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) controller chip designed for use in USB-C chargers,2019and power adapters.

Here's a summary of its pinout and key specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 comes in a QFN24 package with the following pinout:

1. VCC - Power supply voltage (Typically 3.3V or 5V)
2. GND - Ground 
3. INT - Interrupt output (Active low)
4. RST - Reset input (Active low)
5. CLK - Clock input (Typically 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator)
6. SCL - I2C clock (Serial clock)
7. SDA - I2C data (Serial data)
8. PP_LATCH - Power path latch input (Active high)
9. PP_EN - Power path enable output (Active high)
10. VBUS_DET - VBUS detection input 
11. CC1 - Configuration Channel 1 (USB-C sideband signal)
