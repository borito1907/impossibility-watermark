Here's a possible psychological portrait of someone who values their time at an extraordinary rate of $1,000,000,000 per second:

**Name:** Aurora "Rory" Timekeeper

**Age:** Late 30s to early 40s (but looks younger due to an intense focus on self-care and time management)

**Physical Appearance:** Rory exudes confidence and poise, often dressing in high-end attire that conveys efficiency and precision. They may sport a stylish watch or wearables that track their productivity and schedule.

**Personality:**

1. **Extreme efficiency enthusiast**: Rory is obsessed with maximizing every moment, always seeking ways to optimize tasks, eliminate waste, and streamline processes.
2. **Time miserliness**: They guard their time zealously, unwilling to spend it on non-essential activities or interactions they deem unproductive. Every second counts, and they're willing to pay top dollar for the most efficient solutions.
3. **Hyper-focused goal-setter**: With crystal-clear objectives, Rory creates intricate plans, sets precise deadlines, and prioritizes tasks ruthlessly to achieve their ambitions.
4. **Perfectionist tendencies**: Their pursuit of perfection can lead to an unwavering commitment to quality, but also occasional bouts of micromanagement and an overemphasis on details.
