The Kolmogorov's zero-one law is a fundamental result in probability theory, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

In simple terms, the law states that for any event (or set of events) in a probability space, certain properties must occur with either zero or one probability.

The Kolmogorov's zero-one law is a fundamental result in probability theory, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

In simple terms, the law states that for any event (or set of events) in a probability space, certain properties must occur with either zero or one probability. In other words:

**If an event is independent of itself and has no "memory" (i.e., its occurrence does not affect future occurrences), then the probability of that event occurring is either 0 (impossible) or 1 (certain).

What is Kolmogorov 0-1 law?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Kolmogorov's zero-one law is a fundamental result in probability theory, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

In simple terms, the law states that for any event (or set of events) in a probability space, certain properties must occur with either zero or one probability. In other words:

**If an event is independent of itself and has no "memory" (i.e., its occurrence does not affect future occurrences), then the probability of that event occurring is either 0 (impossible) or 1 (certain).**

To be more formal, let's consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)

What is Kolmogorov 0-1 law?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Kolmogorov's zero-one law is a fundamental result in probability theory, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

In simple terms, the law states that for any event (or set of events) in a probability space, certain properties must occur with either zero or one probability. In other words:

**If an event is independent of itself and has no "memory" (i.e., its occurrence does not affect future occurrences), then the probability of that event occurring is either 0 (impossible) or 1 (certain).**

To be more formal, let's consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables {Xn} and an event A that is invariant under finite permutations of these variables. Then, according to Kolmogorov's zero-one law:

P(A) = 0 or P(A) = 1

This means that if you were to repeatedly observe the sequence {Xn}, the event A would either almost surely never occur (P(A) = 0) or almost surely always occur (P(A) = 1).
