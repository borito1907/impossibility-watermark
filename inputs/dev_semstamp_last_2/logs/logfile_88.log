[2024-07-30 03:56:58,580][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Rearranging the equation to solve for [H+], we get:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]

Plugging in the values, we get:

[H+] = 1 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)
= 2.08 × 10^(-12) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-12) M.

Note that this value is very low, which makes sense because KOH is a strong base, and it reduces the H+ ion concentration significantly.assistant

Plug in the values:

Plugging in the values, we get:

[H+] = 1 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)

So, the H+ ion concentration in this 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-13) M.assistant

To express this in pH units, you can use the definition of pH:

pH = -log₁₀[H+]

Substituting the value of [H+], we get:

pH = -log₁₀(2.08 × 10^(-13))
≈ 12.68

Therefore, the pH of this 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 12.68.assistant

Note that a high pH indicates a basic solution, which makes sense since KOH is a strong base.

What is the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 x 10–2 M KOH solution?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A chemistry question!

In a strong base like KOH, the hydroxide ions (OH-) are completely dissociated, so we can assume that the concentration of OH- is equal to the concentration of KOH.

The hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] is given by:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M

Now, we need to find the H+ ion concentration. We can use the relation between [H+] and [OH-], which is:

[H+] × [OH-] = Kw

where Kw is the water dissociation constant, approximately equal to 1 × 10^(-14) at room temperature.


[2024-07-30 04:08:02,967][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: Rearranging the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]

Plugging in the values:

[H+] = 1 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)

[H+] ≈ 2.08 × 10^(-12) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in the 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-12) M.

What is the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 x 10–2 M KOH solution?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A chemistry question!

In a strong base like KOH, the hydroxide ions (OH-) are completely dissociated, so we can assume that the concentration of OH- is equal to the concentration of KOH.

The hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] is given by:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M

Now, we need to find the H+ ion concentration. We can use the relation between [H+] and [OH-], which is:

[H+] × [OH-] = Kw

where Kw is the water dissociation constant, approximately equal to 1 × 10^(-14) at room temperature.

Rearranging the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]

Plugging in the values:

[H+] = 1 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)

[H+] ≈ 2.08 × 10^(-12) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in the 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-12) M.

Would you like me to explain any part of this calculation or provide additional context?assistant

Wait, I apologize for the mistake!
