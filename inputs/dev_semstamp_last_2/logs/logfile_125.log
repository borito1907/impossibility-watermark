Network Allocation and Network Dimensioning are two related but distinct concepts in telecommunications and computer networking.

**Network Allocation:**
Network Allocation refers to the process of assigning or allocating network resources,. These resources can include bandwidth,2019-10-15T14:30Z, the number of users, as well as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, The primary goal of network allocation is to ensure that each user or application receives an appropriate share of available network resources, ensuring efficient utilization of the network capacity.

In other words, network allocation is about distributing the existing network resources among different users, applications, or services to meet their requirements.

**Network Dimensioning:**
Network Dimensioning, also known as Network Sizing, focuses on determining the required network resources,.e., sizing the network infrastructure) to support a given set of traffic demands, to guarantee a certain level of performance.

Whats the difference between network allocation and network dimensioning?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Network Allocation and Network Dimensioning are two related but distinct concepts in telecommunications and computer networking.

**Network Allocation:**
Network Allocation refers to the process of assigning or allocating network resources,. These resources can include bandwidth,2019-10-15T14:30Z, the number of users, as well as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, The primary goal of network allocation is to ensure that each user or application receives an appropriate share of available network resources, ensuring efficient utilization of the network capacity.

In other words, network allocation is about distributing the existing network resources among different users, applications, or services to meet their requirements.

**Network Dimensioning:**
Network Dimensioning, also known as Network Sizing, focuses on determining the required network resources,.e., sizing the network infrastructure) to support a given set of traffic demands, to guarantee a certain level of performance. This involves estimating the necessary network capacity, including the number of devices, links, speed etcetera.

The primary objective of network dimensioning is to determine the minimum resources required to satisfy a specific set of service-level agreements (SLAs), performance metrics, like throughput delay packet loss rate, jitter, and other quality-of-service (QoS) parameters).
