Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** "Web of Steel"

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

We see the iconic New York City skyline before zooming in on the Daily Bugle building. Suddenly, A DRONE FLIES BY, camera attached, it swoops and dives through the city streets.

CUT TO:

PETER PARKER (Spider-Man) perched atop a skyscraper, a quiver full of web-shooters at his hips. He's got a concerned look on his face as he watches the drone fly by.

PETER (V.O.)
Something's off. That drone doesn't belong here.

Suddenly, Super Hearing kicks in, to reveal...

SUPERMAN soaring towards the city!

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** "Web of Steel"

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

We see the iconic New York City skyline before zooming in on the Daily Bugle building. Suddenly, A DRONE FLIES BY, camera attached, it swoops and dives through the city streets.

CUT TO:

PETER PARKER (Spider-Man) perched atop a skyscraper, a quiver full of web-shooters at his hips. He's got a concerned look on his face as he watches the drone fly by.

PETER (V.O.)
Something's off. That drone doesn't belong here.

Suddenly, Super Hearing kicks in, to reveal...

SUPERMAN soaring towards the city!

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) flying over the metropolis, (thought bubble) I've been tracking an unusual energy signature...

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** "Web of Steel"

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

We see the iconic New York City skyline before zooming in on the Daily Bugle building. Suddenly, A DRONE FLIES BY, camera attached, it swoops and dives through the city streets.

CUT TO:

PETER PARKER (Spider-Man) perched atop a skyscraper, a quiver full of web-shooters at his hips. He's got a concerned look on his face as he watches the drone fly by.

PETER (V.O.)
Something's off. That drone doesn't belong here.

Suddenly, Super Hearing kicks in, to reveal...

SUPERMAN soaring towards the city!

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) flying over the metropolis, (thought bubble) I've been tracking an unusual energy signature...

He spots the drone, toying with the citizens below.

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** "Web of Steel"

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

We see the iconic New York City skyline before zooming in on the Daily Bugle building. Suddenly, A DRONE FLIES BY, camera attached, it swoops and dives through the city streets.

CUT TO:

PETER PARKER (Spider-Man) perched atop a skyscraper, a quiver full of web-shooters at his hips. He's got a concerned look on his face as he watches the drone fly by.

PETER (V.O.)
Something's off. That drone doesn't belong here.

Suddenly, Super Hearing kicks in, to reveal...

SUPERMAN soaring towards the city!

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) flying over the metropolis, (thought bubble) I've been tracking an unusual energy signature...

He spots the drone, toying with the citizens below.

SUPERMAN (Kal-El)
That drone is using advanced Kryptonian tech!

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** "Web of Steel"

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

We see the iconic New York City skyline before zooming in on the Daily Bugle building. Suddenly, A DRONE FLIES BY, camera attached, it swoops and dives through the city streets.

CUT TO:

PETER PARKER (Spider-Man) perched atop a skyscraper, a quiver full of web-shooters at his hips. He's got a concerned look on his face as he watches the drone fly by.

PETER (V.O.)
Something's off. That drone doesn't belong here.

Suddenly, Super Hearing kicks in, to reveal...

SUPERMAN soaring towards the city!

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (Kal-El) flying over the metropolis, (thought bubble) I've been tracking an unusual energy signature...

He spots the drone, toying with the citizens below.

SUPERMAN (Kal-El)
That drone is using advanced Kryptonian tech! Whoever's controlling it must be stopped!

Spider-Man leaps into action, shooting webs to swing into the fray!
