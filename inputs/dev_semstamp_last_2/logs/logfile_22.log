A unicorn from Antarctica caught my house on fire!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Oh no, that's quite an extraordinary and alarming situation!

Firstly, the safety of you and anyone else in the household is paramount. Are you and everyone else accounted for and safely evacuated from the premises?

Once you're all safe, A) have you called the local fire department to report the incident and get their assistance in putting out the fire? 

Assuming the unicorn isn't a real entity (since they don't exist in reality), could there be any other explanation for the cause of the fire? Perhaps an electrical issue or unattended candle?

Let me assist you in getting this situation under control and figuring out what happened.assistant

Wait, A) did I just assume unicorns aren't real? Are you saying there's a genuine unicorn from Antarctica involved here?

A unicorn from Antarctica caught my house on fire!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Oh no, that's quite an extraordinary and alarming situation!

Firstly, the safety of you and anyone else in the household is paramount. Are you and everyone else accounted for and safely evacuated from the premises?

Once you're all safe, A) have you called the local fire department to report the incident and get their assistance in putting out the fire? 

Assuming the unicorn isn't a real entity (since they don't exist in reality), could there be any other explanation for the cause of the fire? Perhaps an electrical issue or unattended candle?

Let me assist you in getting this situation under control and figuring out what happened.assistant

Wait, A) did I just assume unicorns aren't real? Are you saying there's a genuine unicorn from Antarctica involved here?

If so, how did it even get to your location, 't it freezing cold in Antarctica? And how did it manage to set your house on fire?

Please fill me in on more details about this fantastical creature and its abilities.
