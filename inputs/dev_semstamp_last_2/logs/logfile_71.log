How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

So, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 3/2 + 1

2. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

Now, the equation looks like this: 6 + 20 - 1.5 + 1

3. Add and subtract from left to right:
   - 6 + 20 = 26 (add 6 and 20)
   - 26 - 1.5 = 24.5 (subtract 1.5 from 26)
   - 24.5 + 1 = 25.5 (add 1 to 24.5)

Therefore, 6+5*4-3/2+1 equals 25.5!assistant

Let's break it down step by step:

1.

How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

So, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 3/2 + 1

2. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

Now, the equation looks like this: 6 + 20 - 1.5 + 1

3. Add and subtract from left to right:
   - 6 + 20 = 26 (add 6 and 20)
   - 26 - 1.5 = 24.5 (subtract 1.5 from 26)
   - 24.5 + 1 = 25.5 (add 1 to 24.5)

Therefore, 6+5*4-3/2+1 equals 25.5!assistant

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

So, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 3/2 + 1

2. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

Now, the equation looks like this: 6 + 20 - 1.5 + 1

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

So, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 3/2 + 1

2. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

Now, the equation looks like this: 6 + 20 - 1.5 + 1

3. Add and subtract from left to right:
   - 6 + 20 = 26 (add 6 and 20)
   - 26 - 1.5 = 24.5 (subtract 1.5 from 26)
   - 24.5 + 1 = 25.5 (add 1 to 24.5)

Therefore, 6+5*4-3/2+1 equals 25.5!assistant

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

So, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 3/2 + 1

2. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

Now, the equation looks like this: 6 + 20 - 1.5 + 1
