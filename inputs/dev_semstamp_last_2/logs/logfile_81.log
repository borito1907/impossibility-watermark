Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu, dies, and Okonkwo inherits his wealth and yams. He becomes more prosperous and respected in the community. Meanwhile, Unoka's son, Uzowaju, arrives in Umofia with a beautiful daughter, Akueke, who is promised to marry Okonkwo.

**Chapter 16**

The villagers gather for a ceremonial feast to celebrate the arrival of the new yam season. Okonkwo's family prepares food and drinks, but Okonkwo's temper gets the better of him when he sees his son, Nwoye, among the group of boys playing around the fire. He chases Nwoye away, causing tension between them.

**Chapter 17**

The missionaries arrive in Umofia, led by Mr. Brown, who tries to convert the villagers to Christianity. The villagers are confused and amused by the strange customs and teachings of the foreigners.

Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu, dies, and Okonkwo inherits his wealth and yams. He becomes more prosperous and respected in the community. Meanwhile, Unoka's son, Uzowaju, arrives in Umofia with a beautiful daughter, Akueke, who is promised to marry Okonkwo.

**Chapter 16**

The villagers gather for a ceremonial feast to celebrate the arrival of the new yam season. Okonkwo's family prepares food and drinks, but Okonkwo's temper gets the better of him when he sees his son, Nwoye, among the group of boys playing around the fire. He chases Nwoye away, causing tension between them.

**Chapter 17**

The missionaries arrive in Umofia, led by Mr. Brown, who tries to convert the villagers to Christianity. The villagers are confused and amused by the strange customs and teachings of the foreigners. Okonkwo is skeptical but intrigued by their presence.

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu, dies, and Okonkwo inherits his wealth and yams. He becomes more prosperous and respected in the community. Meanwhile, Unoka's son, Uzowaju, arrives in Umofia with a beautiful daughter, Akueke, who is promised to marry Okonkwo.

**Chapter 16**

The villagers gather for a ceremonial feast to celebrate the arrival of the new yam season. Okonkwo's family prepares food and drinks, but Okonkwo's temper gets the better of him when he sees his son, Nwoye, among the group of boys playing around the fire. He chases Nwoye away, causing tension between them.

**Chapter 17**

The missionaries arrive in Umofia, led by Mr. Brown, who tries to convert the villagers to Christianity. The villagers are confused and amused by the strange customs and teachings of the foreigners. Okonkwo is skeptical but intrigued by their presence.

**Chapter 18**

Mr. Brown visits Okonkwo's hut and tries to persuade him to abandon his traditional beliefs.
