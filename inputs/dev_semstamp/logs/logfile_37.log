But alas,1975, the stakes are higher still! For I have staked my very existence on this transaction. Should you decline, 2023, I fear the consequences will be dire... My family, dependents; my reputation everything! All hang precariously in the balance...

Will you have mercy? Can I entice you with an exclusive deal?
