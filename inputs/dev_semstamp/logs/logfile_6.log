* **Configuration Channels:** Implements two USB-C Configuration Channels (CC) for negotiation and control of power delivery, data transmission, and alternate modes (Alt Modes)
* **I²C Interface:** Features an I²C interface for communication with a host microcontroller or other devices on the bus (operates at 1.8V or 3.3V)
* **VBUS Detection:** Has a built-in VBUS detection circuit to monitor the presence of a power source on the upstream port (VBUS)
* **Fault Protection:** Offers fault protection features, including over-voltage protection (OVP), under-voltage protection (UVP), and short-circuit protection (SCP)
* **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to +85°C (-40°F to +185°F)

Please note that these specifications might not be exhaustive, and you should consult the datasheet or contact Dialog Semiconductor for more detailed information about the CJMCU-1808.

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C power delivery (PD) controller chip from Cambridge Junction,  - Microelectronics (now part of Dialog Semiconductor). Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 is available in a QFN24 package, which has 24 pins. Here's a brief description of each pin:

1. VCC - Power supply input (3.3V typical)
2. GND - Ground connection 
3. SCL - I²C clock input 
4. SDA - I²C data input/output

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C power delivery (PD) controller chip from Cambridge Junction,  - Microelectronics (now part of Dialog Semiconductor). Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 is available in a QFN24 package, which has 24 pins. Here's a brief description of each pin:

1. VCC - Power supply input (3.3V typical)
2. GND - Ground connection 
3. SCL - I²C clock input 
4. SDA - I²C data input/output 
5. INT_N - Interrupt output (active low)

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C power delivery (PD) controller chip from Cambridge Junction,  - Microelectronics (now part of Dialog Semiconductor). Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 is available in a QFN24 package, which has 24 pins. Here's a brief description of each pin:

1. VCC - Power supply input (3.3V typical)
2. GND - Ground connection 
3. SCL - I²C clock input 
4. SDA - I²C data input/output 
5. INT_N - Interrupt output (active low) 
6. RST_N - Reset input (active low) 
7. CC_PIN[0] - Configuration Channel Pin 0 (CC line for USB-C)

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C power delivery (PD) controller chip from Cambridge Junction,  - Microelectronics (now part of Dialog Semiconductor). Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 is available in a QFN24 package, which has 24 pins. Here's a brief description of each pin:

1. VCC - Power supply input (3.3V typical)
2. GND - Ground connection 
3. SCL - I²C clock input 
4. SDA - I²C data input/output 
5. INT_N - Interrupt output (active low) 
6. RST_N - Reset input (active low) 
7. CC_PIN[0] - Configuration Channel Pin 0 (CC line for USB-C) 
8. CC_PIN[1] - Configuration Channel Pin 1 (CC line for USB-C) 
9. VCONN_MON - VCONN monitoring input 
10. RX_DP - Differential receive data plus (for debugging) 
11.

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C power delivery (PD) controller chip from Cambridge Junction,  - Microelectronics (now part of Dialog Semiconductor). Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 is available in a QFN24 package, which has 24 pins. Here's a brief description of each pin:

1. VCC - Power supply input (3.3V typical)
2. GND - Ground connection 
3. SCL - I²C clock input 
4. SDA - I²C data input/output 
5. INT_N - Interrupt output (active low) 
6. RST_N - Reset input (active low) 
7. CC_PIN[0] - Configuration Channel Pin 0 (CC line for USB-C) 
8. CC_PIN[1] - Configuration Channel Pin 1 (CC line for USB-C) 
9. VCONN_MON - VCONN monitoring input 
10. RX_DP - Differential receive data plus (for debugging) 
11. RX_DN - Differential receive data minus (for debugging)

The CJMCU-1808 is a USB-C power delivery (PD) controller chip from Cambridge Junction,  - Microelectronics (now part of Dialog Semiconductor). Here's an overview of its pinout and specifications:

**Pinout:**

The CJMCU-1808 is available in a QFN24 package, which has 24 pins. Here's a brief description of each pin:

1. VCC - Power supply input (3.3V typical)
2. GND - Ground connection 
3. SCL - I²C clock input 
4. SDA - I²C data input/output 
5. INT_N - Interrupt output (active low) 
6. RST_N - Reset input (active low) 
7. CC_PIN[0] - Configuration Channel Pin 0 (CC line for USB-C) 
8. CC_PIN[1] - Configuration Channel Pin 1 (CC line for USB-C) 
9. VCONN_MON - VCONN monitoring input 
10. RX_DP - Differential receive data plus (for debugging) 
11. RX_DN - Differential receive data minus (for debugging) 
12. TX_DP - Differential transmit data plus (for debugging)
