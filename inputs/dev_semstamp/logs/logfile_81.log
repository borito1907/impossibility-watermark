Here is a summary of Chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after seven years in exile. He finds that his son Nwoye has been indoctrinated into the Christian faith and has taken the name Isaac. Okonkwo is heartbroken and feels that he has lost his son.

**Chapter 16**

Okonkwo's friend, Obierika, tells him about the changes that have taken place in Umuofia during his absence. The Christian missionaries have built a church and many people have converted. The British colonial government has also established a court and appointed a District Commissioner.

**Chapter 17**

The villagers gather at the market to discuss the threat posed by the Christians. Okonkwo suggests taking action against them, but others counsel restraint. Meanwhile, Nwoye/Isaac begins to question his new faith when he sees the missionaries' hypocrisy.

Here is a summary of Chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after seven years in exile. He finds that his son Nwoye has been indoctrinated into the Christian faith and has taken the name Isaac. Okonkwo is heartbroken and feels that he has lost his son.

**Chapter 16**

Okonkwo's friend, Obierika, tells him about the changes that have taken place in Umuofia during his absence. The Christian missionaries have built a church and many people have converted. The British colonial government has also established a court and appointed a District Commissioner.

**Chapter 17**

The villagers gather at the market to discuss the threat posed by the Christians. Okonkwo suggests taking action against them, but others counsel restraint. Meanwhile, Nwoye/Isaac begins to question his new faith when he sees the missionaries' hypocrisy.

Here is a summary of Chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after seven years in exile. He finds that his son Nwoye has been indoctrinated into the Christian faith and has taken the name Isaac. Okonkwo is heartbroken and feels that he has lost his son.

**Chapter 16**

Okonkwo's friend, Obierika, tells him about the changes that have taken place in Umuofia during his absence. The Christian missionaries have built a church and many people have converted. The British colonial government has also established a court and appointed a District Commissioner.

**Chapter 17**

The villagers gather at the market to discuss the threat posed by the Christians. Okonkwo suggests taking action against them, but others counsel restraint. Meanwhile, Nwoye/Isaac begins to question his new faith when he sees the missionaries' hypocrisy.

**Chapter 18**

Tension escalates between the villagers and the Christians.

Here is a summary of Chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after seven years in exile. He finds that his son Nwoye has been indoctrinated into the Christian faith and has taken the name Isaac. Okonkwo is heartbroken and feels that he has lost his son.

**Chapter 16**

Okonkwo's friend, Obierika, tells him about the changes that have taken place in Umuofia during his absence. The Christian missionaries have built a church and many people have converted. The British colonial government has also established a court and appointed a District Commissioner.

**Chapter 17**

The villagers gather at the market to discuss the threat posed by the Christians. Okonkwo suggests taking action against them, but others counsel restraint. Meanwhile, Nwoye/Isaac begins to question his new faith when he sees the missionaries' hypocrisy.

**Chapter 18**

Tension escalates between the villagers and the Christians. The District Commissioner arrives with soldiers and demands that the villagers surrender their guns.

Here is a summary of Chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after seven years in exile. He finds that his son Nwoye has been indoctrinated into the Christian faith and has taken the name Isaac. Okonkwo is heartbroken and feels that he has lost his son.

**Chapter 16**

Okonkwo's friend, Obierika, tells him about the changes that have taken place in Umuofia during his absence. The Christian missionaries have built a church and many people have converted. The British colonial government has also established a court and appointed a District Commissioner.

**Chapter 17**

The villagers gather at the market to discuss the threat posed by the Christians. Okonkwo suggests taking action against them, but others counsel restraint. Meanwhile, Nwoye/Isaac begins to question his new faith when he sees the missionaries' hypocrisy.

**Chapter 18**

Tension escalates between the villagers and the Christians. The District Commissioner arrives with soldiers and demands that the villagers surrender their guns. Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu, delivers a passionate speech about the importance of tradition and warns against the destruction of their way of life.

[2024-07-26 04:03:59,329][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: Here is a summary of Chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15**

Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after seven years in exile. He finds that his son Nwoye has been indoctrinated into the Christian faith and has taken the name Isaac. Okonkwo is heartbroken and feels that he has lost his son.

**Chapter 16**

Okonkwo's friend, Obierika, tells him about the changes that have taken place in Umuofia during his absence. The Christian missionaries have built a church and many people have converted. The British colonial government has also established a court and appointed a District Commissioner.

**Chapter 17**

The villagers gather at the market to discuss the threat posed by the Christians. Okonkwo suggests taking action against them, but others counsel restraint. Meanwhile, Nwoye/Isaac begins to question his new faith when he sees the missionaries' hypocrisy.

**Chapter 18**

Tension escalates between the villagers and the Christians. The District Commissioner arrives with soldiers and demands that the villagers surrender their guns. Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu, delivers a passionate speech about the importance of tradition and warns against the destruction of their way of life.
