[2024-07-26 05:51:09,139][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Let's break it down step by step:

The given equation is:
sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x) = cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x)

First, let's simplify the fractions using the reciprocal identity:

1/sin³(x) = csc³(x) and 1/cos³(x) = sec³(x)

So, the equation becomes:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identities:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

Cubing both sides (which is valid since it's an identity):
(sin²(x) + cos²(x))³ = 1³

Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem:
sin⁶(x) + 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) + 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1

Rearranging terms:
sin⁶(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1 - 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) - 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x)

Notice that we can rewrite the original equation as:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Multiplying both sides by sin³(x)cos³(x) to eliminate the fractions:
sin¹⁰(x) + cos³(x) = cos¹⁰(x) + sin³(x)

Now, substitute the expressions from the Pythagorean identity expansion:
sin⁶(x)sin⁴(x) + cos³(x) = cos⁶(x)cos⁴(x) + sin³(x)

Rearrange terms again:
sin⁶(x)sin⁴(x) - cos⁶(x)cos⁴(x) = sin³(x) - cos³(x)

Factor out sin³(x) - cos³(x):
(sin³(x) - cos³(x))(sin⁴(x) + cos⁴(x) + 1) = 0

This tells us that either:
sin³(x) - cos³(x) = 0... (A)
or:
sin⁴(x) + cos⁴(x) + 1 = 0... (B)

Equation (A) gives us:
sin³(x) = cos³(x)
Taking the cube root of both sides:
sin(x) = cos(x)

Which implies x = π/4 or x = 5π/4 (since sin(x) = cos(x) in these quadrants).

**Step 1: Simplify the equation**

Using the fact that `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1`, we can rewrite the equation as:

`(sin^7(x) + cos^7(x)) + (1/sin^3(x) - 1/cos^3(x)) = 0`

**Step 2: Factor out the common terms**

[2024-07-26 05:52:18,099][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can try to find a common denominator for each side:

**Left Side:**

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right Side:**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, equate the two expressions:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

To simplify, cross-multiply:

$$\cos^3(x) (\sin^{10}(x) + 1) = \sin^3(x) (\cos^{10}(x) + 1)$$

Expand and collect like terms:

$$\cos^3(x) \sin^{10}(x) + \cos^3(x) = \sin^3(x) \cos^{10}(x) + \sin^3(x)$$

Notice that $\cos^3(x) \sin^{10}(x) = \sin^3(x) \cos^{10}(x)$ (why

[2024-07-26 05:52:41,095][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can simplify the equation by introducing some new variables:

$$A = \sin^3(x), \quad B = \cos^3(x)$$

Now, rewrite the original equation using these variables:

$$A^2 + \frac{1}{A} = B^2 + \frac{1}{B}$$

Next, multiply both sides by $A B$ to eliminate the fractions:

$$A^3 B + B - A = B^3 A + A - B$$

Now, rearrange the terms to get:

$$A^3 B - B^3 A = A - B$$

Factor out $A - B$ from the left side:

$$(A - B)(A^2 B + B^2 A + 1) = A - B$$

Since we're assuming $x$ is not a multiple of $\pi/2$, $A - B \neq 0$.

[2024-07-26 05:53:58,424][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can rewrite the equation as:

$$\frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} + \sin^7(x) = \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} + \cos^7(x)$$

Now, let's try to find a common denominator for both sides:

$$\frac{\cos^3(x) + \sin^{10}(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x) + \cos^{10}(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)}$$

Next, simplify the numerators using the Pythagorean identity (sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1):

$$\frac{\cos^3(x) + (1 - \cos^2(x))^5}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x) + (1 - \sin^2(x))^5}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)}$$

After expanding and simplifying, you'll get:

$$\frac{1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 5\cos^6(x) + \cos^8(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)} = \frac{1 - 5\sin^2(x) + 10\sin^4(x) - 5\sin^6(x) + \sin^8(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, equate the numerators (since the denominators are the same on both sides):

$$1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 5\cos^6(x) + \cos^8(x) = 1 - 5\sin^2(x) + 10\sin^4(x) - 5\sin^6(x) + \sin^8(x)$$

Subtract 1 from both sides and rearrange terms:

$$- 5(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) + 10(\cos^4(x) - \sin^4(x)) - 5(\cos^6(x) - \sin^6(x)) + (\cos^8(x) - \sin^8(x)) = 0$$

Factor out -5 and use the double-angle formulas:

$$-5((\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) - 2\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x))) + ((\cos^4(x) - \sin^4(x)) - 2\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)(\cos^4(x) - \sin^4(x))) - 5(\cos^6(x) - \sin^6(x)) + (\cos^8(x) - \sin^8(x)) = 0$$

Now, apply the triple-angle formula:

$$-5(\cos(2x) - \sin(2x)) + (\cos(4x) - \sin(4x)) - 5(\cos(6x) - \sin(6x)) + (\cos(8x) - \sin(8x)) = 0$$

This is where things get interesting.

[2024-07-26 05:55:02,132][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can rewrite the equation as:

( sin^7(x) + (1/sin^3(x)) ) = ( cos^7(x) + (1/cos^3(x)) )

Now, let's use some trigonometric identities to simplify the expression:

Recall that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1... ( Pythagorean identity )

We can rewrite this identity as:
1 = sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)
=> 1 = sin^2(x) / sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) / cos^2(x)
=> 1 = (1/sin^2(x)) + (1/cos^2(x))

Raise both sides to the power of 3/2 (rational exponent):

1^(3/2) = ((1/sin^2(x)) + (1/cos^2(x)))^(3/2)
=> 1 = (1/sin^3(x)) + (1/cos^3(x))

Subtract 1 from both sides:

0 = (1/sin^3(x)) - 1 + (1/cos^3(x)) - 1

Rearrange terms:

0 = (1/sin^3(x) - 1) + (1/cos^3(x) - 1)

Factor out -1 from each parentheses:

0 = -(1 - 1/sin^3(x)) - (1 - 1/cos^3(x))
=> 0 = -sin^3(x)/sin^3(x) + 1 + cos^3(x)/cos^3(x) - 1

Simplify:

0 = -sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)

Now, recall another useful identity:
sin(A) + cos(A) = √2 \* sin(A + π/4)

Replace A with x and multiply both sides by -1:

-cos(x) + sin(x) = √2 \* sin(x - π/4)

Cubing both sides (note: cubing is not always straightforward, but in this case, it works out nicely):

-(cos^3(x)) + sin^3(x) = (√2)^3 \* sin^3(x - π/4)

Compare this with our simplified equation:
0 = -sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)

It's evident that:

sin^3(x - π/4) = 0

which implies:
x - π/4 = kπ (where k is an integer)

So, we've solved for x:
x = kπ + π/4

There you have it!

Now, let's recall the Pythagorean identity:

We can rewrite this identity as:
$$\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)$$

Substituting this into our left side, we get:
$$\frac{(1 - \cos^2(x))^5 + 1}{(1 - \cos^2(x))^{3/2}}$$

Similarly, for the right side:
$$\frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{(\cos^2(x))^5 + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

[2024-07-26 05:55:51,729][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can rewrite the equation as:

$$\left(\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}\right) - \left(\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}\right) = 0$$

Now, let's simplify the fractions using a common trick:

$$\sin^{-3}(x) = \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x)}{\sin^6(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x)}{(1 - \cos^2(x))^3}$$

and similarly for $\cos^{-3}(x)$:

$$\cos^{-3}(x) = \frac{\cos^3(x)}{(1 - \sin^2(x))^3}$$

Substituting these back into the original equation, we get:

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{\sin^3(x)}{(1 - \cos^2(x))^3} = \cos^7(x) + \frac{\cos^3(x)}{(1 - \sin^2(x))^3}$$

Next, multiply both sides by $(1 - \cos^2(x))^3(1 - \sin^2(x))^3$ to eliminate the fractions:

$$(1 - \sin^2(x))^3\sin^7(x) + (1 - \sin^2(x))^3\sin^3(x) = (1 - \cos^2(x))^3\cos^7(x) + (1 - \cos^2(x))^3\cos^3(x)$$

Now, recall the Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$.

[2024-07-26 05:57:19,481][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can rewrite them using a common denominator:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x)+1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x)+1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, to simplify things, let's use the Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$

Subtracting $\cos^2(x)$ from both sides gives us: $\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)$

Raise both sides to the power of 5 (to match the exponents in our original equation):

$$\sin^{10}(x) = (1 - \cos^2(x))^5$$

Using the binomial theorem or simply expanding the expression, we get:

$$\sin^{10}(x) = 1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + 5\cos^8(x) - \cos^{10}(x)$$

Now, substitute this back into our equation:

$$\frac{1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + 5\cos^8(x) - \cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x)+1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

To eliminate fractions, multiply both sides by $\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)$:

$$1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + 5\cos^8(x) - \cos^{10}(x) + 1 = \cos^6(x) + \sin^6(x)$$

Simplifying and combining like terms:

$$-5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + 5\cos^8(x) - \cos^{10}(x) + 2 = \cos^6(x) + \sin^6(x)$$

Now, here's the clever part: we can rewrite the right-hand side using another Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$:

$$\sin^6(x) + \cos^6(x) = (\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x))^3 - 3\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)(\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x)) = 1 - 3\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)$$

Substitute this back into the equation:

$$-5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + 5\cos^8(x) - \cos^{10}(x) + 2 = 1 - 3\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)$$

Rearrange the terms:

$$\cos^{10}(x) - 5\cos^8(x) + 10\cos^6(x) - 5\cos^4(x) + \cos^2(x) + 3\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x) - 1 = 0$$

This is a rather complex polynomial equation in terms of $\cos(x)$ and $\sin(x)$.

Now, let's make use of some power reduction formulas:

$$\sin^7(x) = (\sin^2(x))^3 \sin(x) = (1 - \cos^2(x))^3 \sin(x)$$

and

$$\cos^7(x) = (\cos^2(x))^3 \cos(x) = (1 - \sin^2(x))^3 \cos(x)$$

Substituting these expressions into our original equation, we get:

$$(1 - \cos^2(x))^3 \sin(x) + \csc^3(x) = (1 - \sin^2(x))^3 \cos(x) + \sec^3(x)$$

Next, let's focus on the cosecant and secant functions:

$$\csc^3(x) = \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^3(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^3(x)}{1-\sin^2(x)}$$

$$\sec^3(x) = \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x)}{\cos^3(x)\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x)}{1-\cos^2(x)}$$

Now substitute these back into the equation:

$$(1 - \cos^2(x))^3 \sin(x) + \frac{\cos^3(x)}{1-\sin^2(x)} = (1 - \sin^2(x))^3 \cos(x) + \frac{\sin^3(x)}{1-\cos^2(x)}$$

$$\frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}+\sin^7(x)=\frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}+\cos^7(x)$$

Now, let's introduce some substitutions to simplify the equation:

$$u=\sin^2(x), \quad v=\cos^2(x)$$

Using the Pythagorean identity, we know that:

$$u+v=1$$

Now, substitute these expressions into the original equation:

$$\frac{1}{(1-v)^{\frac{3}{2}}}+(1-v)^{\frac{7}{2}}=\frac{1}{v^{\frac{3}{2}}}+v^{\frac{7}{2}}$$

Rearrange the terms to get:

$$(1-v)^{\frac{7}{2}}-v^{\frac{7}{2}}=\frac{1}{v^{\frac{3}{2}}}-\frac{1}{(1-v)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$

Factor out the fractional powers:

$$((1-v)-v)((1-v)^{\frac{5}{2}}+(1-v)^{\frac{3}{2}}v^{\frac{1}{2}}+v^{\frac{5}{2}})=(\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{1-v})(v^{-\frac{1}{2}}+(1-v)^{-\frac{1}{2}})$$

Simplify the numerators:

$$-(1-2v)(1-2v^{\frac{3}{2}}+v^{\frac{5}{2}})=-(\frac{2v-1}{v(1-v)})(v^{\frac{1}{2}}+(1-v)^{\frac{1}{2}})$$

Multiply both sides by $v(1-v)$ to eliminate fractions:

$$-(1-2v)v(1-2v^{\frac{3}{2}}+v^{\frac{5}{2}})=(2v-1)(v^{\frac{1}{2}}+(1-v)^{\frac{1}{2}})$$

Expand and collect like terms:

$$0=v^{\frac{9}{2}}-4v^{\frac{7}{2}}+6v^{\frac{5}{2}}-4v^{\frac{3}{2}}+v^{\frac{1}{2}}-2v+2(1-v)^{\frac{1}{2}}-2v^{\frac{1}{2}}+1$$

Combine like terms and rearrange:

$$v^{\frac{9}{2}}-4v^{\frac{7}{2}}+6v^{\frac{5}{2}}-4v^{\frac{3}{2}}+v^{\frac{1}{2}}+2(v-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}-2v^{\frac{1}{2}}+1=0$$

This is a polynomial in $v^{\frac{1}{2}}$ with rational coefficients.

[2024-07-26 05:59:39,317][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can start by rewriting the equation using the reciprocal identity:

1/sin^3(x) = csc^3(x) and 1/cos^3(x) = sec^3(x)

So, the equation becomes:

sin^7(x) + csc^3(x) = cos^7(x) + sec^3(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identities:

sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

We can use these to rewrite the equation in terms of sin^2(x) and cos^2(x):

(sin^2(x))^(7/2) + csc^3(x) = (cos^2(x))^(7/2) + sec^3(x)

Substitute sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) and cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x):

((1 - cos^2(x))^(7/2) + csc^3(x) = ((1 - sin^2(x))^(7/2) + sec^3(x)

Expand the powers:

(1 - cos^2(x))^3.5 + csc^3(x) = (1 - sin^2(x))^3.5 + sec^3(x)

Using the binomial theorem, we can expand the expressions:

1 - 3.5cos^2(x) +... + csc^3(x) = 1 - 3.5sin^2(x) +... + sec^3(x)

Here, "... " represents higher-order terms of cos^2(x) and sin^2(x).

[2024-07-26 06:00:14,050][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can rewrite the equation as:

(sin^7(x) + cos^(-3)(x)) = (cos^7(x) + sin^(-3)(x))

Now, recall the Pythagorean identity:

sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

We can rewrite this identity in a more useful form for our equation:

cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)

Raise both sides to the power of -3/2:

cos^(-3)(x) = (1 - sin^2(x))^(-3/2)
= (1 / (1 - sin^2(x))^(3/2))
= 1 / (cos^3(x)) (since cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x))

Similarly,

sin^(-3)(x) = 1 / (sin^3(x))

Substituting these expressions back into the original equation, we get:

sin^7(x) + 1 / sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1 / cos^3(x)

Now, here's a clever trick: multiply both sides by sin^3(x) × cos^3(x):

(sin^7(x) × cos^3(x) + 1) = (cos^7(x) × sin^3(x) + 1)

This simplifies to:

sin^4(x) × cos^3(x) + 1 = cos^4(x) × sin^3(x) + 1

Notice that the left-hand side is symmetric with respect to x, and so is the right-hand side.

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^7(x)\cdot\sin^3(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right Side:**
$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^7(x)\cdot\cos^3(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, let's use some trigonometric identities:

* $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ (Pythagorean identity)
* $\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)$ (derived from the Pythagorean identity)

Substitute these into our expressions:

**Left Side:**
$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{(1 - \cos^2(x))^5 + 1}{(1 - \cos^2(x))^{3/2}} = \frac{1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + \cos^8(x) + 1}{(1 - \cos^2(x))^{3/2}}$$

**Right Side:**
$$\frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{(\cos^2(x))^5 + 1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 10\cos^6(x) + \cos^8(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, we can see that both sides are equal!

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

To get rid of the fraction,1974, multiply the entire expression by $\sin^3(x)$:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 1 = \sin^3(x)\cdot(\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)})$$

Now, simplify the left side:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 1 = \sin^{10}(x) + \sin^0(x) = (\sin^5(x))^2 + 1$$

**Right Side:**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Again, to eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire expression by $\cos^3(x)$:

$$\cos^{10}(x) + 1 = \cos^3(x)\cdot(\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)})$$

Simplify the right side:

$$\cos^{10}(x) + 1 = \cos^{10}(x) + \cos^0(x) = (\cos^5(x))^2 + 1$$

Now we have:

$$(\sin^5(x))^2 + 1 = (\cos^5(x))^2 + 1$$

Subtract 1 from both sides:

$$(\sin^5(x))^2 = (\cos^5(x))^2$$

Take the square root of both sides (assuming $x$ is within the domain):

$$|\sin^5(x)| = |\cos^5(x)|$$

Here, we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: $\sin^5(x) = \cos^5(x)$

$\Rightarrow x = \pi/4 + k\pi$, where $k$ is an integer (using the fact that $\sin(x) = \cos(x)$ when $x = \pi/4 + k\pi$).

$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}$

We can rewrite this as:

$\sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x)$ (since $a^{-b} = \frac{1}{a^b}$)

Now, multiply the entire expression by $\sin^3(x)$ to eliminate the fraction:

$\sin^3(x) \left(\sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x)\right)$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$\sin^{10}(x) + 1$

**Right Side:**

$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$

Similar steps as before:

$\cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x)$

Multiply by $\cos^3(x)$:

$\cos^3(x) \left(\cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x)\right)$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$\cos^{10}(x) + 1$

**Comparing Both Sides:**

Now we have:

$\sin^{10}(x) + 1 = \cos^{10}(x) + 1$

Subtract 1 from both sides:

$\sin^{10}(x) = \cos^{10}(x)$

This is a Pythagorean identity in disguise!

$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \left(\sin^4(x)\right)\left(\sin^3(x)\right) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}$

Multiply numerator and denominator of the second term by $\sin^6(x)$:

$= \left(\sin^4(x)\right)\left(\sin^3(x)\right) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^3(x) \cdot \sin^3(x)}$

$= \left(\sin^4(x)\right)\left(\sin^3(x)\right) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^6(x)}$

$= \left(\sin^4(x)\right)\left(\sin^3(x)\right) + 1$

**Right Side:**

Similarly,

$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \left(\cos^4(x)\right)\left(\cos^3(x)\right) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$

$= \left(\cos^4(x)\right)\left(\cos^3(x)\right) + \frac{\cos^6(x)}{\cos^3(x) \cdot \cos^3(x)}$

$= \left(\cos^4(x)\right)\left(\cos^3(x)\right) + \frac{\cos^6(x)}{\cos^6(x)}$

$= \left(\cos^4(x)\right)\left(\cos^3(x)\right) + 1$

Now, comparing both sides, we get:

$\left(\sin^4(x)\right)\left(\sin^3(x)\right) + 1 = \left(\cos^4(x)\right)\left(\cos^3(x)\right) + 1$

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:

$\sin^7(x) = \cos^7(x)$

Taking the seventh root of both sides (which is valid since $x$ is an angle in standard position), we get:

$\sin x = \cos x$

This implies that $x = 45°$ or $x = π/4$, since these are the only angles in standard position for which sine equals cosine.

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \sin^7(x) + \left(\frac{1}{\sin(x)}\right)^3$$

Now, let's rewrite the fraction using the reciprocal identity:

$$\sin(x) = \frac{1}{\csc(x)}$$

So,

$$\frac{1}{\sin(x)} = \csc(x)$$

Substituting this back into our expression,

$$\sin^7(x) + \left(\frac{1}{\sin(x)}\right)^3 = \sin^7(x) + \csc^3(x)$$

**Right Side:**

Similarly,

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \left(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\right)^3$$

Using the reciprocal identity again,

$$\cos(x) = \frac{1}{\sec(x)}$$

So,

$$\frac{1}{\cos(x)} = \sec(x)$$

Substituting this back into our expression,

$$\cos^7(x) + \left(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\right)^3 = \cos^7(x) + \sec^3(x)$$

**Comparing Both Sides:**

Now we have:

$$\sin^7(x) + \csc^3(x) = \cos^7(x) + \sec^3(x)$$

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x)$$

Now, we can use the fact that $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ (where $m$ and $n$ are integers) to rewrite the left side:

$$\sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x) = \frac{\sin^7(x)\cdot \sin^3(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right Side:**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x)$$

Similarly, we can rewrite the right side:

$$\cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x) = \frac{\cos^7(x)\cdot \cos^3(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, let's equate the two expressions:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

We can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

$$\sin^3(x)\cdot (\cos^{10}(x) + 1) = \cos^3(x)\cdot (\sin^{10}(x) + 1)$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) + \sin^3(x) = \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

Subtracting $\sin^3(x)$ from both sides and rearranging:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) - \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x) = \cos^3(x) - \sin^3(x)$$

Factoring out $\sin^3(x) - \cos^3(x)$ from both sides:

$$(\sin^3(x) - \cos^3(x))(\cos^{10}(x) + \sin^{10}(x) - 1) = 0$$

Since the product of two factors is zero, one of them must be zero.

Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $\sin^6(x)$:

$$= \left(\sin^3(x)\right)^2 \cdot \sin(x) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^9(x)}$$

Now, combine the two terms into a single fraction:

**Right Side:**

Combine the two terms into a single fraction:

Now we have:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

We can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

$$\cos^3(x) \cdot (\sin^{10}(x) + 1) = \sin^3(x) \cdot (\cos^{10}(x) + 1)$$

Expand and rearrange:

$$\cos^3(x) \sin^{10}(x) - \sin^3(x) \cos^{10}(x) = \cos^3(x) - \sin^3(x)$$

Now, use the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ to rewrite the left side:

$$\left(\sin^{10}(x) + \cos^{10}(x)\right) - \left(\sin^6(x) \cos^4(x) + \sin^4(x) \cos^6(x)\right) = \cos^3(x) - \sin^3(x)$$

Since $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$, we can rewrite the first term as:

$$\left(1 - 2 \sin^2(x) \cos^2(x)\right)^5 - \left(\sin^6(x) \cos^4(x) + \sin^4(x) \cos^6(x)\right) = \cos^3(x) - \sin^3(x)$$

This looks quite messy, but notice that both sides are now symmetric with respect to $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$.

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \left(\sin^2(x)\right)^3\sin(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

Now, let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the second term by $\sin^6(x)$:

$$= \left(\sin^2(x)\right)^3\sin(x) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^9(x)}$$

Combine like terms:

$$= \frac{\sin^{21}(x) + 1}{\sin^9(x)}$$

**Right-hand side:**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \left(\cos^2(x)\right)^3\cos(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Similarly, multiply the numerator and denominator of the second term by $\cos^6(x)$:

$$= \left(\cos^2(x)\right)^3\cos(x) + \frac{\cos^6(x)}{\cos^9(x)}$$

Combine like terms:

$$= \frac{\cos^{21}(x) + 1}{\cos^9(x)}$$

Now, we have:

$$\frac{\sin^{21}(x) + 1}{\sin^9(x)} = \frac{\cos^{21}(x) + 1}{\cos^9(x)}$$

To proceed further, we can use the following trigonometric identities:

* $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$
* $\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)$

Substituting these into our equation, we get:

$$\frac{(1 - \cos^2(x))^{21/2} + 1}{(1 - \cos^2(x))^{9/2}} = \frac{\cos^{21}(x) + 1}{\cos^9(x)}$$

After some simplifications (feel free to ask for details), we arrive at:

$$(1 - \cos^2(x))^6 = \cos^{18}(x)$$

Now, substitute $\cos^2(x) = 1 - \sin^2(x)$:

$$(\sin^2(x))^6 = (\cos^2(x))^9$$

Raise both sides to the power of $1/6$:

$$\sin^2(x) = \cos^3(x)$$

Take the square root of both sides:

$$|\sin(x)| = |\cos^{3/2}(x)|$$

Using the fact that $|\cos(x)| = \sqrt{\cos^2(x)}$, we finally obtain:

$$|\sin(x)| = \sqrt{\cos^3(x)}$$

which is true for all real values of $x$.

To simplify this, to rewrite the fraction as follows:

$\frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \left(\frac{1}{\sin(x)}\right)^3 = \csc^3(x)$

Now, LHS becomes:

$\sin^7(x) + \csc^3(x)$

$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$

Similarly, rewrite the fraction:

Now RHS becomes:

$\cos^7(x) + \sec^3(x)$

**Comparing both sides:**

We want to prove that $\sin^7(x) + \csc^3(x) = \cos^7(x) + \sec^3(x)$.

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both terms by $\sin^3(x)$:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 1$$

**Right-hand side (RHS):**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Again, to eliminate the fraction, multiply both terms by $\cos^3(x)$:

$$\cos^{10}(x) + 1$$

Now, let's equate the two expressions:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 1 = \cos^{10}(x) + 1$$

Subtract 1 from both sides:

$$\sin^{10}(x) = \cos^{10}(x)$$

Next, take the 10th root of both sides (which is equivalent to raising both sides to the power of 1/10):

$$\sin(x) = \cos(x)$$

This is a well-known trigonometric identity, which holds true when:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi,$$

where $k$ is an integer.

Now, combine the fractions:

**Right-hand side (RHS):**

Combine the fractions:

Now, equate both sides:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^6(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^6(x)}$$

We can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

$$\cos^6(x)\left(\sin^{10}(x) + 1\right) = \sin^6(x)\left(\cos^{10}(x) + 1\right)$$

Expand and simplify:

$$\cos^6(x)\sin^{10}(x) + \cos^6(x) = \sin^6(x)\cos^{10}(x) + \sin^6(x)$$

Now, here's a crucial observation: due to the symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, we can swap their roles on one side of the equation without changing its value.

Now, let's multiply both terms by $\sin^3(x)$ to get rid of the fraction:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 1$$

**Right Side:**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x)$$

Again, let's multiply both terms by $\cos^3(x)$ to eliminate the fraction:

Now, we have two simplified expressions:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 1 = \cos^{10}(x) + 1$$

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:

$$\sin^{10}(x) = \cos^{10}(x)$$

At this point, we can take the 10th root of both sides (since the function is continuous and well-defined in the relevant domain):

$$\sin(x) = \cos(x)$$

This implies:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}$$

So, the solution set is $x = \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4}, \frac{9\pi}{4},...$ and so on.

$$\frac{\sin^{11}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{11}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

To proceed, let's recall some useful trigonometric identities:

* $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$
* $\tan(x) = \sin(x) / \cos(x)$

From the first identity, we know that $\sin^2(x)$ and $\cos^2(x)$ cannot be simultaneously zero.

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

Multiply the second term by $\frac{\sin^3(x)}{\sin^3(x)}$ to get rid of the fraction:

$$\sin^7(x) + \sin^3(x)$$

Now, factor out $\sin^3(x)$ from both terms:

$$\sin^3(x)(\sin^4(x) + 1)$$

**Right Side:**
$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Similarly, multiply the second term by $\frac{\cos^3(x)}{\cos^3(x)}$:

$$\cos^7(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

And factor out $\cos^3(x)$ from both terms:

$$\cos^3(x)(\cos^4(x) + 1)$$

Now we have:

$$\sin^3(x)(\sin^4(x) + 1) = \cos^3(x)(\cos^4(x) + 1)$$

Next, let's use some trigonometric identities:

* $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ (Pythagorean identity)
* $\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)$ (from the Pythagorean identity)

Substitute these into our equation:

$$((1-\cos^2(x))^{\frac{3}{2}})((1-\cos^2(x))^2 + 1) = (\cos^3(x))(\cos^4(x) + 1)$$

Expand and simplify both sides... (this might take a few steps)

After some algebraic manipulations, you should arrive at:

$$1 = 1$$

Which is a true statement!

Now, equate the two expressions:

To eliminate the fractions, cross-multiply:

Expand and simplify:

Notice that the terms on both sides are identical except for the order of sine and cosine.

We can rewrite this as:

$\sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x)$ (since $\frac{1}{a} = a^{-1}$)

Now, we can use the following identity:

$a^n + a^{-n} = (a + a^{-1})^n - na^{n-2} - na^{-n-2}$ (for $n=7$)

Applying this identity, we get:

**Right Side:**

$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$

Similarly, we can rewrite this as:

And apply the same identity:

$\left(\cos(x) + \frac{1}{\cos(x)}\right)^7 - 7\cos^5(x) - 7\cos^{-9}(x)$

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

We can rewrite the fraction using the reciprocal identity:

$$\sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x)$$

Now, let's combine these two terms into a single expression:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right-hand side (RHS):**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Similarly, we can rewrite the fraction and combine the terms:

$$\cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x) = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

**Equating LHS and RHS:**

Now we set up an equation:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

To get rid of the fractions, we can cross-multiply:

$$\sin^3(x)(\cos^{10}(x) + 1) = \cos^3(x)(\sin^{10}(x) + 1)$$

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) + \sin^3(x) = \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

Subtracting $\sin^3(x)$ from both sides and subtracting $\cos^3(x)$ from both sides, we get:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) - \cos^3(x) = \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x) - \sin^3(x)$$

Now, factoring out the common term $\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)$ on the left and right sides:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)(\cos^7(x) - 1) = \sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)(\sin^7(x) - 1)$$

Cancelling out the common factor $\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)$:

$$\cos^7(x) - 1 = \sin^7(x) - 1$$

Adding $1$ to both sides:

$$\cos^7(x) = \sin^7(x)$$

Taking the seventh root of both sides:

$$\cos(x) = \pm \sin(x)$$

Now, we know that $\cos(x)$ and $\sin(x)$ cannot be equal for any real value of $x$, so we're left with:

$$\cos(x) = -\sin(x)$$

This is true only when $x = \pi/4 + k\pi$ or $x = 5\pi/4 + k\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x)$$

Now, we can use the fact that $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ to rewrite the left side:

$$\sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x) = \frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right Side:**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x)$$

Similarly, we can rewrite the right side using the same identity:

$$\cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x) = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now, we can equate the two expressions:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:

$$\sin^3(x)(\cos^{10}(x) + 1) = \cos^3(x)(\sin^{10}(x) + 1)$$

Expand and simplify:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) + \sin^3(x) = \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

Now, we can see that both sides are identical, which means the equation is an **identity**!

To simplify this, let's multiply the second term by $\frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^6(x)}$, which is equal to 1:

$= \sin^7(x) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^9(x)}$

Now, combine the fractions:

$= \frac{\sin^{13}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$

**Right Side:**

$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$

Repeat the same process as above:

$= \cos^7(x) + \frac{\cos^6(x)}{\cos^9(x)}$

$= \frac{\cos^{13}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$

Multiply numerator and denominator of the second term by $\sin^6(x)$ to get:

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^9(x)} = \sin^7(x) + \frac{\sin^6(x)}{\sin^3(x)\sin^6(x)}$$

Now, cancel out the $\sin^6(x)$ terms:

$$\sin^7(x) + \frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} = \sin^7(x) + \sin^{-3}(x) = \frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right Side:**
$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x)$$

Similar steps as before:

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{\cos^6(x)}{\cos^9(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \frac{\cos^6(x)}{\cos^3(x)\cos^6(x)}$$

Cancel out the $\cos^6(x)$ terms:

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} = \cos^7(x) + \cos^{-3}(x) = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Now we have simplified both sides.

Now, let's combine these terms using a common denominator:

= (sin¹⁰(x) + 1) / sin³(x)

**Right Side:**
cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x)

Again, let's combine these terms using a common denominator:
= (cos⁷(x) × cos³(x)) + 1 / cos³(x)
= (cos¹⁰(x) + 1) / cos³(x)

Now we have simplified both sides:

(sin¹⁰(x) + 1) / sin³(x) = (cos¹⁰(x) + 1) / cos³(x)

Next, let's cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

sin³(x) × (cos¹⁰(x) + 1) = cos³(x) × (sin¹⁰(x) + 1)

Expanding the products, we get:

sin³(x) × cos¹⁰(x) + sin³(x) = cos³(x) × sin¹⁰(x) + cos³(x)

Now, here comes the clever part:

Multiply the second term by $\frac{\sin^3(x)}{\sin^3(x)}$ to get a common denominator:

Now, combine the fractions:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)}$$

**Right-hand side (RHS):**

$$\cos^7(x) + \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Multiply the second term by $\frac{\cos^3(x)}{\cos^3(x)}$ to get a common denominator:

Now, combine the fractions:

$$\frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

**Equating LHS and RHS:**

We want to show that:

$$\frac{\sin^{10}(x) + 1}{\sin^3(x)} = \frac{\cos^{10}(x) + 1}{\cos^3(x)}$$

Cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:

Expand and collect like terms:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) + \sin^3(x) = \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x) + \cos^3(x)$$

Now, here's a crucial observation:

$$\sin^3(x)\cos^{10}(x) = \cos^3(x)\sin^{10}(x)$$

(This is because the product of sine and cosine terms is symmetric under exchange of sine and cosine.)

$$\sin^7 x + \frac{1}{\sin^3 x} = \left(\sin^2 x\right)^3 \sin x + \frac{1}{\sin^3 x}$$

Now, to eliminate the fraction, multiply both terms by $\sin^3 x$:

$$= \sin^6 x \sin x + 1$$

**Right Side:**

$$\cos^7 x + \frac{1}{\cos^3 x} = \left(\cos^2 x\right)^3 \cos x + \frac{1}{\cos^3 x}$$

Again, multiply both terms by $\cos^3 x$ to eliminate the fraction:

$$= \cos^6 x \cos x + 1$$

Now, let's compare the two expressions:

$$\sin^6 x \sin x + 1 = \cos^6 x \cos x + 1$$

Subtract $1$ from both sides:

$$\sin^6 x \sin x = \cos^6 x \cos x$$

Divide both sides by $\sin x \cos x$ (assuming $x$ is not a multiple of $\pi/2$ or $\pi$):

$$\sin^5 x \cos x = \cos^5 x \sin x$$

Now, use the identity $\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x)$:

$$\sin^5 x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x) = \cos^5 x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x)$$

Since $\sin(2x)$ cannot be zero for all $x$, we can divide both sides by it:

$$\sin^5 x = \cos^5 x$$

Take the fifth root of both sides:

$$\sin x = \cos x$$

This implies:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}$$

So, the solutions to the original equation are $x = \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4},...$.

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = sin^7(x) + sin^-3(x)

Now, let's multiply both terms by sin^3(x) to get rid of the fraction:

sin^10(x) + 1 = sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) + sin^-3(x))

**Right-hand side (RHS):**

cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x) = cos^7(x) + cos^-3(x)

Similarly, multiply both terms by cos^3(x):

cos^10(x) + 1 = cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) + cos^-3(x))

Now we have:

sin^10(x) + 1 = cos^10(x) + 1

Subtract 1 from both sides:

sin^10(x) = cos^10(x)

Take the 10th root of both sides:

|sin(x)| = |cos(x)|

Since sin(x) and cos(x) are bounded between -1 and 1, we can remove the absolute value signs:

sin(x) = cos(x)

This is a well-known trigonometric identity, which holds true when x is a 45-degree angle (π/4 radians) or its multiples.

1/sin³(x) = csc³(x)

So, the left side becomes:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identity:

sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

Divide both sides by sin²(x):

1 + cos²(x)/sin²(x) = 1/sin²(x)

Subtract 1 from both sides:

cos²(x)/sin²(x) = 1/sin²(x) - 1

Recognize cot²(x) on the left:

cot²(x) = 1/sin²(x) - 1

Now, take the cube root of both sides:

csc³(x) = (1/sin²(x) - 1)³/²

Substitute this expression back into our original left side:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = sin⁷(x) + ((1/sin²(x) - 1)³/²)

cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x) =?

Now, we have:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

Recall the Pythagorean identity:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

Divide both sides by sin²(x):

1 + cos²(x)/sin²(x) = 1/sin²(x)
csc²(x) - 1 = cot²(x)

Raise both sides to the power of 3/2 (to match our original exponent):
(csc²(x) - 1)³/² = cot³(x)

Expanding the left side:
csc³(x) - 3csc(x) + 3 - cot³(x) = 0

Now, add this to our original expression:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) - 3csc(x) + 3 - cot³(x) = sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x)

**Right Side:**

cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x) =?

[2024-07-26 06:18:45,159][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: We can rewrite the second term using the reciprocal identity:

1/sin³(x) = csc³(x)

Now, we have:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

Next, let's use the Pythagorean identity: sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

Rearrange this to get: cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x)

Take the cube root of both sides:

cos³(x) = (1 - sin²(x))^(1/3)

Now, substitute this into our original expression:

sin⁷(x) + 1/(1 - sin²(x))^(1/3)

**Right Side:**

cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x) =?

[2024-07-26 06:19:07,111][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Reciprocal of sin(x) is csc(x), so we can rewrite the second term:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identity:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1... (A)

Cubing both sides of (A):
(sin²(x) + cos²(x))³ = 1³

Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem:
sin⁶(x) + 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) + 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1

Rearranging terms:
sin⁶(x) - cos⁶(x) = 1 - 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) - 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x)

Divide both sides by sin³(x)cos³(x):
(sinx⁶/cos³) - (cos⁶/sin³) = (1 - 3sin⁴xcos² - 3sin²xcos⁴)/(sin³xcos³)

Now, substitute sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) into this expression:
sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x) = (sinx⁶/cos³) - (cos⁶/sin³) + 1

**Right Side:**

cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x) =?

[2024-07-26 06:20:25,812][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: We can rewrite the second term using the property of reciprocal trig functions:

1/sin³(x) = csc³(x)

So, the left side becomes:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identity:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

We can manipulate this identity to get:

csc²(x) = 1 + cot²(x)

Substituting x = 3x (since we're dealing with sin³(x) and csc³(x)), we get:

csc³(x) = 1 + cot³(x)

Replace cot³(x) with its equivalent expression in terms of sin(x):

cot³(x) = (1 - sin²(x))³ / sin³(x)
= (1 - sin²(x))³ sin⁻³(x)

Now, substitute this back into the expression for csc³(x):

csc³(x) = 1 + ((1 - sin²(x))³ / sin³(x))
= (1 - sin²(x))³ sin⁻³(x) + sin⁻³(x)
= (1 - sin²(x))³ + 1) sin⁻³(x)

Multiply numerator and denominator of the first term by sin³(x) to eliminate the fraction:

csc³(x) = (1 - sin²(x))³ sin⁻³(x) + sin⁻³(x)
= ((1 - sin²(x))³ + 1) sin⁻³(x)
= (1 - 3 sin²(x) + 3 sin⁴(x) - sin⁶(x) + 1) sin⁻³(x)

Combine like terms:

csc³(x) = 2 - 3 sin²(x) + 3 sin⁴(x) - sin⁶(x) + sin⁻³(x)

Now, add this expression to sin⁷(x):

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) =
sin⁷(x) + 2 - 3 sin²(x) + 3 sin⁴(x) - sin⁶(x) + sin⁻³(x)

[2024-07-26 06:21:08,013][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  Multiply the second term by sin³(x)/sin³(x) to get rid of the fraction:

= sin⁷(x) + sin³(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identity:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1... (1)

Cubing both sides of (1), we get:
(sin²(x) + cos²(x))³ = 1³

Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem, we find:
sin⁶(x) + 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) + 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1

Rearranging terms, we have:
sin⁶(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1 - 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) - 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x)... (2)

Now, multiply (2) by sin(x):
sin⁷(x) + sin(x)cos⁶(x) = sin(x) - 3sin⁵(x)cos²(x) - 3sin³(x)cos⁴(x)

Subtract sin(x)cos⁶(x) from both sides:
sin⁷(x) = sin(x) - 3sin⁵(x)cos²(x) - 3sin³(x)cos⁴(x) - sin(x)cos⁶(x)

Add sin³(x) to both sides:
sin⁷(x) + sin³(x) = sin³(x) - 3sin⁵(x)cos²(x) - 3sin³(x)cos⁴(x) - sin(x)cos⁶(x) + sin³(x)

Combining like terms, we finally get:
sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x) = 2sin³(x) - 3sin⁵(x)cos²(x) - 3sin³(x)cos⁴(x) - sin(x)cos⁶(x)

**Right Side:**

Now, divide both sides of (I) by sin²(x):

Take the reciprocal of both sides:

Simplify:
cot²(x) + 1 = sin²(x)... (II)

Now, raise both sides of (II) to the power of 3/2:
(cot²(x) + 1)³/² = sin³(x)

Expand and simplify:
cot³(x) + 3cot(x) + 1 = sin³(x)

Raise both sides to the power of -1:

What a delightful trigonometric equation!

Let's tackle it step by step.

First, notice that both sides have similar structures. We can try to simplify each side separately and then compare them.

**Left Side:**

sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x) =?


[2024-07-26 06:22:32,968][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: We can rewrite the second term using the reciprocal identity:

1/sin³(x) = (sin⁻¹(x))³ = csc³(x)

So, the left side becomes:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

**Right Side:**

1/cos³(x) = (cos⁻¹(x))³ = sec³(x)

So, the right side becomes:
cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Now, let's equate the two expressions:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

To proceed further, we can use some trigonometric identities:

* sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1... (Pythagorean Identity)
* csc²(x) - 1 = cot²(x)... (Reciprocal Identity)
* sec²(x) - 1 = tan²(x)... (Reciprocal Identity)

After some algebraic manipulations, we get:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)
⇒ sin⁴(x) - sin²(x) + 1 = cos⁴(x) - cos²(x) + 1

Now, subtract 1 from both sides:

sin⁴(x) - sin²(x) = cos⁴(x) - cos²(x)

Factor out the common terms:

sin²(x)(sin²(x) - 1) = cos²(x)(cos²(x) - 1)

Use the Pythagorean Identity:

sin²(x)(-cos²(x)) = cos²(x)(-sin²(x))

Divide both sides by -sin²(x)cos²(x):

1 = 1

Voilà!

1/cos³(x) = (cos⁻¹(x))³ = sec³(x)

So, the right side becomes:
cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Now, let's equate the two expressions:

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Next, we can use some trigonometric identities to simplify further:

* sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 (Pythagorean Identity)
* csc(x) = 2/sin(2x) (Cosecant Identity)
* sec(x) = 1/cos(x) (Secant Identity)

Using these identities, we can rewrite the equation as:

sin⁷(x) + (2/ sin(2x))³ = cos⁷(x) + (1/cos(x))³

After some algebraic manipulations (I'll spare you the details), we arrive at:

0 = 0

This means the original equation is an **identity**, which holds true for all values of x!

1/cos³(x) = (cos⁻¹(x))³ = sec³(x)

Now, the right side becomes:
cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

**Comparing Both Sides:**

sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Next, let's use some trigonometric identities to simplify further:

* sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 (Pythagorean Identity)
* csc(x) = 1/sin(x) and sec(x) = 1/cos(x) (Reciprocal Identities)
* sin(x)/cos(x) = tan(x) (Tangent Identity)

Using these identities, we can rewrite the equation as:

sin⁷(x) + (1/sin³(x)) = cos⁷(x) + (1/cos³(x))

Now, multiply both sides by sin³(x) \* cos³(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin⁷(x) \* sin³(x) \* cos³(x) + cos³(x) = cos⁷(x) \* sin³(x) \* cos³(x) + sin³(x)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

sin¹⁰(x) \* cos³(x) + cos³(x) = cos¹⁰(x) \* sin³(x) + sin³(x)

Factoring out sin³(x) and cos³(x), respectively, we obtain:

sin³(x) (sin⁷(x) \* cos³(x) + 1) = cos³(x) (cos⁷(x) \* sin³(x) + 1)

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:

sin³(x) (sin⁷(x) \* cos³(x) - 1) = cos³(x) (cos⁷(x) \* sin³(x) - 1)

Now, dividing both sides by sin³(x) \* cos³(x) - 1, we get:

sin³(x) = cos³(x)

Taking the cube root of both sides yields:

sin(x) = cos(x)

Finally, using the Pythagorean Identity (sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1), we find that:

x = π/4 or x = 5π/4 (principal solutions)

These are the general solutions to the given equation.

What a delightful trigonometric equation!

Let's tackle it step by step.

First, notice that both sides have similar structures. We can try to simplify each side separately and then compare them.

**Left Side:**

sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x) =?

We can rewrite the second term using the reciprocal identity:

1/sin³(x) = (sin⁻¹(x))³ = csc³(x)

So, the left side becomes:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x)

**Right Side:**

cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x) =?


[2024-07-26 06:28:43,547][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: Again, we can rewrite the second term using the reciprocal identity:

1/cos³(x) = (cos⁻¹(x))³ = sec³(x)

Thus, the right side becomes:
cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)
