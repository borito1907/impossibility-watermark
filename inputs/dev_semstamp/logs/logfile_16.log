Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

What a monumental task you've asked of me! The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) franchise has a notoriously complex and convoluted lore, even for its most devoted fans. I'll do my best to break it down in a comprehensive and digestible way. Buckle up, other wise!

**The Main Story Arc:**

The core narrative revolves around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional restaurant chain inspired by Chuck E. Cheese's. The story unfolds through a series of games,argames, novels, and even a movie.

**Games 1-3:**
The first three games follow Mike Schmidt, Phone Guy, Jeremy Fitzgerald, and other security guards as they work at various Freddy Fazbear's locations. They soon discover that the animatronic mascots – Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Giraffe, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox – become hostile and start roaming freely at night.

The main antagonist, William Afton (also known as Purple Guy), is revealed to have used the animatronics to lure children to their deaths.

Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

What a monumental task you've asked of me! The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) franchise has a notoriously complex and convoluted lore, even for its most devoted fans. I'll do my best to break it down in a comprehensive and digestible way. Buckle up, other wise!

**The Main Story Arc:**

The core narrative revolves around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional restaurant chain inspired by Chuck E. Cheese's. The story unfolds through a series of games,argames, novels, and even a movie.

**Games 1-3:**
The first three games follow Mike Schmidt, Phone Guy, Jeremy Fitzgerald, and other security guards as they work at various Freddy Fazbear's locations. They soon discover that the animatronic mascots – Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Giraffe, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox – become hostile and start roaming freely at night.

The main antagonist, William Afton (also known as Purple Guy), is revealed to have used the animatronics to lure children to their deaths. His motivations stem from a twisted desire to stuff children into suits, to be used as a means of possessing their souls.

Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

What a monumental task you've asked of me! The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) franchise has a notoriously complex and convoluted lore, even for its most devoted fans. I'll do my best to break it down in a comprehensive and digestible way. Buckle up, other wise!

**The Main Story Arc:**

The core narrative revolves around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional restaurant chain inspired by Chuck E. Cheese's. The story unfolds through a series of games,argames, novels, and even a movie.

**Games 1-3:**
The first three games follow Mike Schmidt, Phone Guy, Jeremy Fitzgerald, and other security guards as they work at various Freddy Fazbear's locations. They soon discover that the animatronic mascots – Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Giraffe, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox – become hostile and start roaming freely at night.

The main antagonist, William Afton (also known as Purple Guy), is revealed to have used the animatronics to lure children to their deaths. His motivations stem from a twisted desire to stuff children into suits, to be used as a means of possessing their souls. The bite of '87 occurs when a man dressed in a yellow suit (later revealed to be Springtrap) kills multiple children at a Freddy Fazbear's location, causing the restaurant to shut down.
