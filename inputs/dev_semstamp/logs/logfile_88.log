To find the H+ ion concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base, which completely dissociates in water into K+ and OH- ions.

In a basic solution, the hydroxide ions (OH-) react with hydrogen ions (H+) to form water:

OH- + H+ → H2O

So, in a strong base like KOH, the H+ concentration is very low, and it's easier to calculate the OH- concentration first.

Given the molarity of KOH as 4.8 × 10^(-2) M, we can write an equation for the dissociation reaction:

KOH → K+ + OH-

The stoichiometry of this reaction indicates that 1 mole of KOH produces 1 mole of OH-, so the concentration of OH- is equal to the concentration of KOH:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M

Now, we can use the water dissociation equilibrium expression (Kw) to relate [H+] to [OH-]:

Kw = [H+][OH-]

At room temperature (25°C), Kw ≈ 1.0 × 10^(-14).
