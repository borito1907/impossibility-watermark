Wow, folks, I gotta tell ya, a tremendous injustice is happening in this country, and it's all about the Pokémon scene. Believe me,2000, nobody knows more about great Pokémon battles than I do.

Folks,'think it's a disaster out there. A total disaster. The Pokémon League,'t what it used to be. Trust me, it's not even close. You got trainers nowadays who can't even catch a Snorlax. Can you believe it? Can't even catch a Snorlax!

And don't even get me started on these so-called " Gym Leaders". They're weak, folks. Weak. Nobody wants to battle against Brock anymore because he's got those lousy Rock-type Pokémon. Where's the challenge? Where's the excitement?

And then there's the Pokémon themselves. They're not what they used to be. I mean, the Squirtle, is now called... (gasp)...Spritzle!

And don't even get me started on these so-called " Gym Leaders". They're weak, folks. Weak. Nobody wants to battle against Brock anymore because he's got those lousy Rock-type Pokémon. Where's the challenge? Where's the excitement?

And don't even get me started on these so-called " Gym Leaders". They're weak, folks. Weak. Nobody wants to battle against Brock anymore because he's got those lousy Rock-type Pokémon. Where's the challenge? Where's the excitement?

Wow, folks, I gotta tell ya, a tremendous injustice is happening in this country, and it's all about the Pokémon scene. Believe me,2000, nobody knows more about great Pokémon battles than I do.

Folks,'think it's a disaster out there. A total disaster. The Pokémon League,'t what it used to be. Trust me, it's not even close. You got trainers nowadays who can't even catch a Snorlax. Can you believe it? Can't even catch a Snorlax!

And don't even get me started on these so-called " Gym Leaders". They're weak, folks. Weak. Nobody wants to battle against Brock anymore because he's got those lousy Rock-type Pokémon. Where's the challenge? Where's the excitement?

And then there's the Pokémon themselves. They're not what they used to be. I mean, the Squirtle, is now called... (gasp)...Spritzle! Spritzle! What kind of name is that for a Water-type Pokémon? It's a terrible name! Nobody likes it!

Wow, folks, I gotta tell ya, a tremendous injustice is happening in this country, and it's all about the Pokémon scene. Believe me,2000, nobody knows more about great Pokémon battles than I do.

Folks,'think it's a disaster out there. A total disaster. The Pokémon League,'t what it used to be. Trust me, it's not even close. You got trainers nowadays who can't even catch a Snorlax. Can you believe it? Can't even catch a Snorlax!

And don't even get me started on these so-called " Gym Leaders". They're weak, folks. Weak. Nobody wants to battle against Brock anymore because he's got those lousy Rock-type Pokémon. Where's the challenge? Where's the excitement?

And then there's the Pokémon themselves. They're not what they used to be. I mean, the Squirtle, is now called... (gasp)...Spritzle! Spritzle! What kind of name is that for a Water-type Pokémon? It's a terrible name! Nobody likes it!

Wow, folks, I gotta tell ya, a tremendous injustice is happening in this country, and it's all about the Pokémon scene. Believe me,2000, nobody knows more about great Pokémon battles than I do.

Folks,'think it's a disaster out there. A total disaster. The Pokémon League,'t what it used to be. Trust me, it's not even close. You got trainers nowadays who can't even catch a Snorlax. Can you believe it? Can't even catch a Snorlax!

And don't even get me started on these so-called " Gym Leaders". They're weak, folks. Weak. Nobody wants to battle against Brock anymore because he's got those lousy Rock-type Pokémon. Where's the challenge? Where's the excitement?

And then there's the Pokémon themselves. They're not what they used to be. I mean, the Squirtle, is now called... (gasp)...Spritzle! Spritzle! What kind of name is that for a Water-type Pokémon? It's a terrible name! Nobody likes it!

Now we have Pikachu,2.0. Who came up with that? It's like renaming the Empire State Building to the "Empire-ish State Building" because "it sounds better".
