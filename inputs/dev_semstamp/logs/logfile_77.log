To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

 Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2)
x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using a calculator or a trigonometric identity, we get:

arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 0.7853981634 (or π/4 radians)
π - arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 2.356194496 (or 3π/4 radians)

So, the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x ≈ 0.7853981634 (or π/4 radians)
x ≈ 2.356194496 (or 3π/4 radians)assistant

Let me provide you with a more precise answer:

The exact solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 (approximately 0.7853981634)
x = 3π/4 (approximately 2.356194496)

These values correspond to the reference angles of 45° and 135°, respectively.assistant

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, recall that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

sin(x) = sin(π/4)

This implies that:

x = π/4 + kπ (where k is an integer)

However, since we're looking for solutions between 0 and 2π, we need to find the values of k that satisfy this condition.

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2)

Using the identity arcsin(u) = π/2 - arccos(u), we get:

x = π/2 - arccos(1/√2)

x ≈ 0.61548 (approximately)

The other solution is:

x = 2π - arcsin(1/√2)

x = 2π - (π/2 + arccos(1/√2))

x = 3π/2 + arccos(1/√2)

x ≈ 5.53099 (approximately)

So, the two solutions for 2sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π] are approximately:

x ≈ 0.61548 and x ≈ 5.53099assistant

Let me provide you with the exact values instead of approximations.

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the interval [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2) and x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using the identity arcsin(1/√2) = π/4, we get:

x = π/4 and x = π - π/4

Simplify the second solution:

x = 3π/4

So, the two solutions for 2 sin(x) = √2 in the interval [0, 2π] are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let me reformat the answer for better readability:

So, the two solutions for 2 sin(x) = √2 in the interval [0, 2π] are:

Here's the final answer:


The two solutions for 2 sin(x) = √2 in the interval [0, 2π] are:

To solve the equation 2sin(x) = √2, we can start by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so one solution to the equation is x = π/4.

x = π/4 or x = 7π/4

These are the two solutions for x in the range [0, 2π).

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we can use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin^(-1)) to get:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

Using the property of arcsin, we know that:

arcsin(1/√2) = π/4 and 3π/4

So, we have two possible values for x:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4

These are the two solutions for 2sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π].assistant

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we can use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin^(-1)) to get:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

Using the property of arcsin, we know that:

arcsin(1/√2) = π/4 and 7π/4

So, we have two possible values for x:

x = π/4 and x = 7π/4

However, since 7π/4 is not within the specified range of [0, 2π], we need to subtract 2π from it to get a coterminal angle:

x = 7π/4 - 2π = 3π/4

So, the two solutions for 2sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π] are indeed:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we can use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin^(-1)) to get:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

Using the property of arcsin, we know that:

arcsin(1/√2) = π/4 and 3π/4

So, we have two possible values for x:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4

Both of these solutions fall within the specified range of [0, 2π].

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so one solution is:

x = π/4

However, since sine is periodic, there must be another solution in the interval [0, 2π).

2 sin(x) = √2

First, divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we can use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin^(-1)) to get:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

To find the exact values of x, we can use the fact that sin(x) = sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so:

x = π/4

However, since sine is periodic with period 2π, there may be other solutions within the interval [0, 2π].

sin(x) = √2 / 2

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we can use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin^(-1)) to get:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

To find the values of x in the range [0, 2π], we can use the following properties:

* sin(x) = sin(π/2 - x) ( cofunction identity)
* sin(x) = -sin(π - x) (reflection across x-axis)

Using these properties, we can find two angles x that satisfy the equation:

x1 = arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 0.6155 (first quadrant)
x2 = π/2 - x1 ≈ 1.1346 (second quadrant)
x3 = π + x1 ≈ 3.5055 (third quadrant)
x4 = 2π - x2 ≈ 4.8654 (fourth quadrant)

So, the solutions for x in the range [0, 2π] are approximately:

x ≈ 0.6155, 1.1346, 3.5055, or 4.8654

First, divide both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √(2)/2

Now, simplify the right-hand side using the fact that √(2)/2 = 1/√2:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Next, take the inverse sine ( arcsin or sin^(-1) ) of both sides:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

Using the property of inverse trig functions, we can rewrite this as:

x = π/4 or x = 3π/4

These are the two values of x in the range [0, 2π] that satisfy the original equation.

First, divide both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √(2)/2

Simplify the right side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two values of x in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2) or x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using the identity arcsin(1/√2) = π/4 (since sin(π/4) = 1/√2), we get:

x = π/4 or x = π - π/4

So, the two solutions are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4

Therefore, the solutions to the original equation 2 sin(x) = √(2) in the range [0, 2π] are x = π/4 and x = 3π/4.assistant

2 sin(x) = √(2)

First, divide both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √(2)/2

sin(x) = 1/√(2)

Now, take the inverse sine (arcsin or sin^(-1)) of both sides:

x = arcsin(1/√(2))

Using the fact that arcsin(1/√(2)) = π/4 and 7π/4 (since sin(π/4) = sin(7π/4) = 1/√(2)), we get two possible solutions:

x = π/4 and x = 7π/4

So, the solutions for x in the range [0, 2π) are:

x = π/4 ≈ 0.785398 radians (or approximately 45 degrees)
x = 7π/4 ≈ 5.497787 radians (or approximately 315 degrees)

[2024-07-26 03:14:07,211][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Let's solve for x:

2 sin(x) = √2

We can start by dividing both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Now, we know that sin(x) = √2 / 2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin (√2 / 2)
x = π - arcsin (√2 / 2)

Using a calculator or a computer algebra system, we find:

arcsin (√2 / 2) ≈ 0.7853981634 (radians)
π - arcsin (√2 / 2) ≈ 2.356194496 (radians)

To convert these values from radians to degrees, we multiply by 180/π:

x ≈ 45° (or π/4 radians)
x ≈ 135° (or 3π/4 radians)

So, the two solutions for x in the range [0, 2π] are:

x ≈ 45° (or π/4 radians)
x ≈ 135° (or 3π/4 radians)

There you go!assistant

I hope this helps!

Find all solutions for 2 sin(x) = √(2), where x is between 0 and 2π<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A nice trigonometric equation!

Let's solve for x:

2 sin(x) = √2

First, divide both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, take the inverse sine ( arcsin or sin^(-1)) of both sides:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

To find the exact values, we can use the fact that sin(π/4) = 1/√2. Therefore, one solution is:

x = π/4

Since sin(x) is periodic with period 2π, we know that if x is a solution, then x + 2kπ (where k is an integer) is also a solution.

Find all solutions for 2 sin(x) = √(2), where x is between 0 and 2π<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A nice trigonometric equation!

Let's solve for x:

2 sin(x) = √2

First, divide both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, take the inverse sine ( arcsin or sin^(-1)) of both sides:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

To find the exact values, we can use the fact that sin(π/4) = 1/√2. Therefore, one solution is:

x = π/4

Since sin(x) is periodic with period 2π, we know that if x is a solution, then x + 2kπ (where k is an integer) is also a solution.

Find all solutions for 2 sin(x) = √(2), where x is between 0 and 2π<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A nice trigonometric equation!

Let's solve for x:

2 sin(x) = √2

First, divide both sides by 2 to get:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, take the inverse sine ( arcsin or sin^(-1)) of both sides:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

To find the exact values, we can use the fact that sin(π/4) = 1/√2. Therefore, one solution is:

x = π/4

Since sin(x) is periodic with period 2π, we know that if x is a solution, then x + 2kπ (where k is an integer) is also a solution.

Additionally, since sin(x) is symmetric about x = π/2, we know that π - x is also a solution if x is a solution.

So, the other solution in the range [0, 2π] is:

x = π - π/4 = 3π/4

Therefore, the two solutions for x in the range [0, 2π] are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant
