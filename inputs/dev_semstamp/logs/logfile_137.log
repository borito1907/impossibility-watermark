Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).

[2024-07-26 15:40:26,326][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: 2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.

A great topic!

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.

A great topic!

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify that both hosts have network connectivity between them.

A great topic!

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify that both hosts have network connectivity between them.

**Migration Steps:**

**Step 1: Export the VM from ESXi (OVA/OVF format)**

1.

A great topic!

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify that both hosts have network connectivity between them.

**Migration Steps:**

**Step 1: Export the VM from ESXi (OVA/OVF format)**

1. Open the vSphere Client or vCenter Server and select the VM you want to migrate.

[2024-07-26 15:47:40,787][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: 2. Right-click the VM and select "Export OVF Template" (or "Export OVA" in older versions of vSphere).

A great topic!

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify that both hosts have network connectivity between them.

**Migration Steps:**

**Step 1: Export the VM from ESXi (OVA/OVF format)**

1. Open the vSphere Client or vCenter Server and select the VM you want to migrate.
2. Right-click the VM and select "Export OVF Template" (or "Export OVA" in older versions of vSphere).

A great topic!

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify that both hosts have network connectivity between them.

**Migration Steps:**

**Step 1: Export the VM from ESXi (OVA/OVF format)**

1. Open the vSphere Client or vCenter Server and select the VM you want to migrate.
2. Right-click the VM and select "Export OVF Template" (or "Export OVA" in older versions of vSphere).
3. Choose a location to save the exported file (e.g., a shared storage or a local disk).

Migrating a virtual machine (VM) from an ESXi host to a KVM host requires some planning and careful execution. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a successful migration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **KVM host setup**: Ensure your KVM host is properly set up, with the required hardware, and the necessary software packages installed (e.g., qemu-kvm, is installed).
2. **ESXi VM shutdown**: Shut down the VM on the ESXi host to prevent any data inconsistencies during the migration process.
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify that both hosts have network connectivity between them.

**Migration Steps:**

**Step 1: Export the VM from ESXi (OVA/OVF format)**

1. Open the vSphere Client or vCenter Server and select the VM you want to migrate.
2. Right-click the VM and select "Export OVF Template" (or "Export OVA" in older versions of vSphere).
3. Choose a location to save the exported file (e.g., a shared storage or a local disk).
4. Wait for the export process to complete.
