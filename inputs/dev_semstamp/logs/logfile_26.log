**Details:**

* The tiger cub has a huge smile on its face, by the wheel, one paw is gently tapping the horn,'toot!' 
* A few strands of NYC-style steam rise up from the manhole covers as the cub drives past.
* To add some humor, the license plate on the taxi reads "ROAR10" (a play on the cub's species and the NY state abbreviation).
