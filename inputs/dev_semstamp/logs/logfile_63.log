What is the price of natural gas for consumers in Qatar?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

As of 2021, the price of natural gas for consumers in Qatar is highly subsidized and fixed by the government. The prices are as follows:

* For Qatari citizens:
	+ Residential sector: QR 0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh)
	+ Commercial sector: QR 0.20 per kWh 
* For expatriates and non-Qatari residents:
	+ Residential sector: QR 0.30 per kWh 
	+ Commercial sector: QR 0.40 per kWh 

It's worth noting that these prices are significantly lower than the global average due to Qatar's large reserves of natural gas and the government's policy to subsidize energy costs for its citizens.

Additionally, there may be some variations depending on the specific tariff plan, usage, and other factors, so it's always best to check with the relevant authorities or service providers for the most up-to-date information.
