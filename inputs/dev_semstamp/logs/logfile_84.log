What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A great question about condensed matter physics!

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model that proposes a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in certain materials. It was introduced by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in the 1960s.

In conventional superconductors, a phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction leads to Cooper pairing, and subsequently, superconductivity.

What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A great question about condensed matter physics!

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model that proposes a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in certain materials. It was introduced by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in the 1960s.

In conventional superconductors, a phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction leads to Cooper pairing, and subsequently, superconductivity. However, (some) unconventional superconductors don't fit this picture.

What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A great question about condensed matter physics!

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model that proposes a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in certain materials. It was introduced by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in the 1960s.

In conventional superconductors, a phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction leads to Cooper pairing, and subsequently, superconductivity. However, (some) unconventional superconductors don't fit this picture. Kohn-Luttinger theory attempts to explain these exceptions.

The key idea is that the Coulomb repulsion between electrons, (which normally prevents them from forming pairs) can be overcome by exchange of virtual excitations of the material's lattice vibrations (optical phonons).

What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A great question about condensed matter physics!

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model that proposes a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in certain materials. It was introduced by physicists Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in the 1960s.

In conventional superconductors, a phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction leads to Cooper pairing, and subsequently, superconductivity. However, (some) unconventional superconductors don't fit this picture. Kohn-Luttinger theory attempts to explain these exceptions.

The key idea is that the Coulomb repulsion between electrons, (which normally prevents them from forming pairs) can be overcome by exchange of virtual excitations of the material's lattice vibrations (optical phonons). This indirect interaction can lead to an attractive potential between electrons,2013, causing them to form pairs and condensate into a superconducting state.

To be more specific, (and technical):

1. **Electron-hole asymmetry**: The model exploits the difference in the density of states at the Fermi level for electrons and holes.
2. **Virtual excitation exchange**: Electrons interact with each other by exchanging virtual optical phonons, which are excitations of the lattice vibrational modes.
3. **Indirect attraction**: This exchange leads to an effective attractive potential between electrons, resulting in Cooper pairing.
