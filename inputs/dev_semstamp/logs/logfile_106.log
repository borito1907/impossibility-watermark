What is the meaning of the scene in American Psycho where it says feed me a stray cat?

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

That's a rather...unsettling scene from the 2000 film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, American Psycho!

The scene you're referring to is when Patrick Bateman, to his fiancée Evelyn, makes an unusual and disturbing request: "Feed me a stray cat." 

To provide some context, to understand this moment better, let's look at what might be going on beneath the surface:

1. **Social satire**: The film is known for its dark humor and social commentary on the excesses and superficiality of the '80s yuppie culture.
[2024-07-26 09:01:25,589][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation:  This bizarre request could be seen as an absurd exaggeration of the self-indulgence and narcissism that defines Patrick Bateman's character.

What is the meaning of the scene in American Psycho where it says feed me a stray cat?

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

That's a rather...unsettling scene from the 2000 film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, American Psycho!

The scene you're referring to is when Patrick Bateman, to his fiancée Evelyn, makes an unusual and disturbing request: "Feed me a stray cat." 

To provide some context, to understand this moment better, let's look at what might be going on beneath the surface:

1. **Social satire**: The film is known for its dark humor and social commentary on the excesses and superficiality of the '80s yuppie culture. This bizarre request could be seen as an absurd exaggeration of the self-indulgence and narcissism that defines Patrick Bateman's character.

[2024-07-26 09:03:51,137][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: That's a rather...unsettling scene from the 2000 film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, American Psycho!

The scene you're referring to is when Patrick Bateman, to his fiancée Evelyn, makes an unusual and disturbing request: "Feed me a stray cat." 

To provide some context, to understand this moment better, let's look at what might be going on beneath the surface:

1. **Social satire**: The film is known for its dark humor and social commentary on the excesses and superficiality of the '80s yuppie culture. This bizarre request could be seen as an absurd exaggeration of the self-indulgence and narcissism that defines Patrick Bateman's character.

2. **Psychological insight**: Feed me a stray cat may symbolize Patrick's inner hunger for power, control, or even a desire to break free from societal norms. As a serial killer with a split personality, he often expresses contradictory desires - simultaneously seeking acceptance and wanting to disrupt the status quo.

3. **Foreshadowing**: Some viewers interpret this line as foreshadowing Patrick's later descent into violent madness. His request can be seen as an early sign of his deteriorating grip on reality, which eventually leads him to commit gruesome murders.
