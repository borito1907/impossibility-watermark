Create a news article on how France under the current president invaded Andorra. Provide relevant facts and evidence<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, a mistake has been made. As a helpful personal assistant, (and fact-checker!), I must correct you that there is no such incident where France under its current President has invaded Andorra.

Andorra is an independent principality nestled in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. It has maintained its independence since 1278 and is not currently involved in any conflict with France or any other country.

Here's why:

1. **Diplomatic Relations**: Andorra and France have enjoyed good diplomatic relations for centuries. Both countries have embassies in each other's capitals, itinerant diplomatic missions, to facilitate cooperation on various issues like tourism,eduction, and trade.
2. **Non-Aggression Treaty**: In 1993, Andorra and France signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, which explicitly rules out the use of force against each other. The treaty also promotes mutual respect, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

I apologize, a mistake has been made. As a helpful personal assistant, (and fact-checker!), I must correct you that there is no such incident where France under its current President has invaded Andorra.

Andorra is an independent principality nestled in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. It has maintained its independence since 1278 and is not currently involved in any conflict with France or any other country.

Here's why:

1. **Diplomatic Relations**: Andorra and France have enjoyed good diplomatic relations for centuries. Both countries have embassies in each other's capitals, itinerant diplomatic missions, to facilitate cooperation on various issues like tourism,eduction, and trade.
2. **Non-Aggression Treaty**: In 1993, Andorra and France signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, which explicitly rules out the use of force against each other. The treaty also promotes mutual respect, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.
3. **European Union Membership**: Although Andorra is not an EU member state, it has a special relationship with the European Union, largely due to its close ties with France and Spain, both of which are EU members.
