I think you meant to say "Demons" (also known as "The Possessed" or "The Devils") is a novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky, published in 1872.

"Demons" is a complex and thought-provoking novel that explores the themes of nihilism, moral decay, and the dangers of revolutionary ideology.

I think there may be some confusion! The correct title of the novel is indeed "Demons" (also translated as "The Possessed" or "The Devils"), and it was written by Fyodor Dostoevsky between 1871-1872.

I think there's a slight mistake there!

You're referring to "Demons" (also translated as "The Possessed" or "The Devils"), a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky, published in 1872.
