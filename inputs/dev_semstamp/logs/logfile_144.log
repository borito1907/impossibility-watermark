(Verse 1)
I woke up to the sound of silence, it was dead of night 
The stars were shining bright outside my window light 
But I knew what had to be done, a task that couldn't wait 
So I stumbled through the darkness, to the laundry fate 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, with shadows all around 
The washing machine's gentle hum, the only sound 
I'm searching for the whites and colors, in this dimly lit space 
Hoping I don't mix them up, as I sort with a tired face 

(Verse 2)
The room was bathed in moonlight, an eerie, silver glow 
As I loaded up the washer, with socks and shirts to go 
The detergent packet crinkled, like a whisper in my ear 
Reminding me of all the tasks, that I'd rather hold dear 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, with shadows all around 
The washing machine's gentle hum, the only sound 
I'm searching for the whites and colors, in this dimly lit space 
Hoping I don't mix them up, as I sort with a tired face 

(Bridge)
Perhaps I'll find a magic trick, to make this chore disappear 
Or maybe I'll just dream of clean clothes, without a single fear 
But till then, I'll stumble on, through this dark of night 
And hope that morning comes soon, when the light will shine so bright 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, with shadows all around 
The washing machine's gentle hum, the only sound 
I'm searching for the whites and colors, in this dimly lit space 
Hoping I don't mix them up, as I sort with a tired face 

(Outro)
Now the cycle's complete, the dirty's gone away 
As I fold and put them back, come dawn of a brand new day 
The darkness fades to nothing, as morning takes its place 
And I'll remember this strange night, with a smile on my face.assistant

I hope you enjoyed the song!

(Verse 1)
I stumbled through the night, my heart beating slow 
The only sound, the washing machine's low hum and grow 
No lights to guide me, just shadows on the floor 
But dirty clothes won't clean themselves, and I gotta get it done for more 

(Chorus) 
Laundry in the dark, feeling my way around 
Soap and water swirling, as the world spins upside down 
In the black of night, I'm searching high and low 
For that missing sock, the one that's gone with the flow 

(Verse 2) 
I load up the dryer, with a flicker of faith 
Hoping all will turn out right, no stains or wrinkles in place 
In this midnight hour, when the world is still asleep 
My hands move by feel alone, sorting colors, whites from deep 

(Chorus) 
Laundry in the dark, feeling my way around 
Soap and water swirling, as the world spins upside down 
In the black of night, I'm searching high and low 
For that missing sock, the one that's gone with the flow 

(Bridge) 
Maybe in the darkness lies a secret peace 
A quiet rhythm guiding me through life's release 
Amidst the spinning drums, a melody unfolds 
As I rinse away my worries, young and old 

(Chorus) 
Laundry in the dark, feeling my way around 
Soap and water swirling, as the world spins upside down 
In the black of night, I'm searching high and low 
For that missing sock, the one that's gone with the flow 

(Outro) 
Now morning breaks, a new day begins 
Folded and fresh, my task is done within 
The laundry's clean, but the memory stays 
Of those dark hours, where love and hope found their waysassistant

(Verse 1)
I'm standin' in the darkness, a solitary soul 
With detergent and desire, I take control 
The washing machine hums, its gentle, mournful sigh 
As I sort through the shadows, to get it right 

(Chorus)
Oh, laundry in the dark of night 
A lone wolf, a single spark 
Feelin' my way through the dirty pile 
Hopin' for clean clothes and a peaceful smile 

(Verse 2)
Cotton whispers secrets as the spin cycle spins 
A midnight mystery unfolds beneath my skin 
No light to guide me, just the sound of the drum 
As I navigate this load, one by one 

(Chorus)
Oh, laundry in the dark of night 
A lone wolf, a single spark 
Feelin' my way through the dirty pile 
Hopin' for clean clothes and a peaceful smile 

(Bridge)
In this dimly lit laundromat of my mind 
The rhythm of the washers, a lullaby to find 
A sense of calm descending like a rain 
As I rinse away my worries,'til the stain's gone 

(Chorus)
Oh, laundry in the dark of night 
A lone wolf, a single spark 
Feelin' my way through the dirty pile 
Hopin' for clean clothes and a peaceful smile 

(Outro)
Now the cycles complete, the dryers soft roar 
Unfolding fresh hope from the darkness once more 
Clean sheets and sweet surrender in the morning dew 
Laundry in the dark, a secret or two 

This song takes you on a journey of doing laundry in the dark, using imagery and metaphors to paint a vivid picture of the experience.

(Verse 1)
I'm standing alone, in this dimly lit space 
The washing machine's hum, is the only sound I embrace 
No light to guide me, just shadows on the wall 
But the stains won't wash away, until I hear it all 

(Chorus) 
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Feeling my way through, with all my might 
Soap and water mix, as I stumble through 
Hoping for clean clothes, when the morning breaks anew 

(Verse 2) 
I sort and I load, by touch and by feel 
No bright lights shining down, to reveal what's real 
Whites from colors, delicates too 
Fumbling fingers cross, that everything's true blue 

(Chorus) 
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Feeling my way through, with all my might 
Soap and water mix, as I stumble through 
Hoping for clean clothes, when the morning breaks anew 

(Bridge) 
Perhaps it's peaceful, in this quiet haze 
A midnight meditation, amidst soap and daze 
Thoughts wander free, as I wait for the spin cycle 
Maybe in darkness, lies a hidden magic 

(Chorus) 
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Feeling my way through, with all my might 
Soap and water mix, as I stumble through 
Hoping for clean clothes, when the morning breaks anew

As the machines stop, and the silence grows 
I'll wait for dawn's arrival, to see how it goes 
Will my efforts pay off?

(Verse 1)
I'm searching through the dirty clothes, trying to find my way 
The lights have gone out, and I'm left to face the day 
The washing machine's humming, a gentle melody 
As I sort and load, blindly 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
No illumination, just the moon's pale light 
I stumble through the rinse cycle,'trusting my sight 
But somehow it gets done, in this dark laundry fight 

(Verse 2) 
Tumbling drums, spinning wheels, the rhythm's all wrong 
Without a glimmer, shadows make me feel so strong 
Like a blind man feeling his way, through the darkest space 
I grope for fabric softness, praying I don't make a mistake on this dark laundry race 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
No illumination, just the moon's pale light 
I stumble through the rinse cycle,'trusting my sight 
But somehow it gets done, in this dark laundry fight 

(Bridge) 
Perhaps the darkness has its charm 
Maybe it's the perfect time to disarm 
From worries of the world outside 
In this dark room, where soap and water reside 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
No illumination, just the moon's pale light 
I stumble through the rinse cycle, trusting my heart tonight 
And somehow it gets done, in this dark laundry delight 

(Outro) 
The spin cycle slows, the wash is finally clean 
Though blind, I've conquered this laundry scene 
In the dark of night, where fears would take their toll 
I emerge victorious, with fresh-smelling control!assistant

I hope you enjoyed the song I came up with!

(Verse 1)
I stumbled through the darkness, blind and alone 
The washer's hum,­, my only tone 
I loaded up the machine, in the dead of night 
 Hoping for clean clothes, but it didn't feel right 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Fumbling with the socks,'till we embark 
On this midnight ride, where shadows play 
Hoping I don't mix, the lights from grey 

(Verse 2)
I spilled some detergent,'t on the floor 
Slipped and fell,'t tried to shut the door 
A lone sock disappeared,'into thin air 
Now I'm left with singles, and a bunch to spare 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Fumbling with the socks,'till we embark 
On this midnight ride,'thadows play 
Hoping I don't mix,'the lights from grey 

(Bridge)
Maybe I should've waited 'til the dawn 
But deadlines loomed,'dirty laundry scorn 
Now I'm stuck here,'trying to find 
The missing match,'in this dimly lit grind 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Fumbling with the socks,'till we embark 
On this midnight ride,'thadows play 
Hoping I don't mix,'the lights from grey 

(Outro)
The cycle's done,'the lights now shine 
Clean clothes await,'but at what cost divine?

I'm standing here, surrounded by the night 
The only sound, the washer's gentle might 
A lone bulb flickers, above my head 
As I sort and load, the darkness fills my bed 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
Trying to get it right, without a light 
Stumbling through the shadows, feeling my way 
Hoping that my whites will come out bright someday 

(Verse 2)
I fumble for the detergent, hoping I've got enough 
A stranger in this dimly lit laundry rough 
The rumble of the dryer, a lonely, mournful sigh 
Echoes through the room, as I wonder why 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
Trying to get it right, without a light 
Stumbling through the shadows, feeling my way 
Hoping that my whites will come out bright someday 

(Bridge)
Maybe it's the solitude, that brings me peace 
Or maybe it's the rhythm, of the washing machine's release 
In this midnight hour, I find my own sweet calm 
As the cycles spin and hum, my heart beats like a balm 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
Trying to get it right, without a light 
Stumbling through the shadows, feeling my way 
Hoping that my whites will come out bright someday 

(Outro)
Now the wash is done, the darkness slowly fades 
And as I fold the clean clothes, a new dawn is made 
Perhaps it's not so bad, this laundry in the night 
For in the stillness, I found a strange, quiet delight.assistant

(Verse 1)
I woke up to the darkness, midnight's hush fell deep inside my room 
The clock said it was late,yawnin', my weary eyes felt gloom 
No moon shone bright, no stars aligned tonight  
Just me and dirty clothes, lonely, a lonely fight 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark, feeling for each stain 
Sorting whites from colors,'trusting my worn-out brain  
Rinse and spin, rinse and spin, trying not to make a mistake  
In this dimly lit world, where shadows undertake 

(Verse 2) 
My hands move slow and steady like a sleepwalker's pace  
Unloading the machine, I trip upon an empty space 
Fumbling with the zippers, buttons, and seams so fine  
My fingers stumble forward, praying not to entwine 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark, feeling for each stain  
Sorting whites from colors, trusting my worn-out brain  
Rinse and spin, rinse and spin, trying not to make a mistake  
In this dimly lit world, where shadows undertake  

(Bridge) 
Perhaps in the stillness of this night  
Lies a peace that only comes with morning light  
Where socks match and the bed is made  
And I'll find solace when the dawn breaks through the shade 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark, feeling for each stain  
Sorting whites from colors, trusting my worn-out brain  
Rinse and spin, rinse and spin, trying not to make a mistake  
In this dimly lit world, where shadows undertakeassistant

(Verse 1)
I stumbled through the night, so tired and so blind 
Reached for the washing machine, without a shine 
No lights to guide my way, just darkness all around 
But the dirty clothes kept piling up, way up high on the ground 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely little ride 
Feeling my way through the fabric, hoping I'll get it right 
Soap and water, swirling round, a mystery unfolds tonight 
Doing laundry in the dark, where the lights don't shine so bright 

(Verse 2)
The detergent dripped like rain, as I poured it with a sigh 
Fumbling for the buttons, praying I wouldn't say goodbye 
To whites and colors mixed, or so I hoped not yet 
The spin cycle hummed its tune, as I closed my eyes and bet 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely little ride 
Feeling my way through the fabric, hoping I'll get it right 
Soap and water, swirling round, a mystery unfolds tonight 
Doing laundry in the dark, where the lights don't shine so bright 

(Bridge)
Maybe this is how the magic happens, under the cover of night 
When the world outside is sleeping, and all is calm and bright 
Perhaps the darkness holds a secret, to making clean what's worn 
And though I stumble, maybe love will find its way to dawn 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely little ride 
Feeling my way through the fabric, hoping I'll get it right 
Soap and water, swirling round, a mystery unfolds tonight 
Doing laundry in the dark, where the lights don't shine so bright 

(Outro)
The rinse cycle ended slow, as morning light began to seep 
I opened my eyes to find, clean clothes, soft and sweet 
A surprise in the silence, that only darkness could bring 
Doing laundry in the dark, my heart starts to singassistant

I stumbled to the washer, blind and alone in the night 
The room was pitch black, but I knew it was right 
Where the soap and detergent waited patiently in line 
For me to pour them in, and make this load of mine 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely little ride 
Feeling my way through the mess, with a prayer that I'll survive 
No light to guide me, just the hum of the machine 
Doing laundry in the dark, where the lost socks go unseen 

(Verse 2)
I reached for the fabric softener, but grabbed something else instead 
Hoping it wouldn't ruin everything, as I poured it into the dread 
The rinse cycle sounded like a stormy rain 
As I crossed my fingers, praying no colors would bleed in vain 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely little ride 
Feeling my way through the mess, with a prayer that I'll survive 
No light to guide me, just the hum of the machine 
Doing laundry in the dark, where the lost socks go unseen

Maybe it's better this way, maybe it's fate 
A chance to let go, and trust the unknown state 
Let the machines do their magic, as I sit back and wait 
And hope that when the lights come on, it won't be too late

Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely little ride

My heart beats slow and steady, as I turn on the wall 
The lights illuminate, and oh what do I see?

Blindly feeling my way, without a care,
The washing machine, it hums its tune,
As I load it up, beneath the moon.

(Verse 1)
Midnight's creeping, and I'm wide awake 
The laundry's piling high, it's time to take 
A trip down to the basement, where the washer awaits 
In the dark of night,2019 it's gonna be a long, hard fate 

(Chorus)
 Doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride 
Trying to find that missing sock, as I stumble by the light 
Of the washing machine humming soft and low 
It's just me and these dirty clothes, as the hours go slow 

(Verse 2)
I fumble through the shadows, feeling my way around 
The detergent's bitter scent, it's all that I've found 
No lights to guide me, just the glow of my phone 
As I sort and load, trying not to make it back home 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride 
Trying to find that missing sock, as I stumble by the light 
Of the washing machine humming soft and low 
It's just me and these dirty clothes, as the hours go slow 

(Bridge)
Perhaps I'll dream of clean sheets, as I drift away 
Or maybe I'll awake to find the morning ray 
But for now, I'll stay down here, lost in this dark place 
Where the only sound is water, dripping on my face 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride 
Trying to find that missing sock, as I stumble by the light 
Of the washing machine humming soft and low 
It's just me and these dirty clothes, as the hours go slow 

(Outro)
So if you see me stumbling up the stairs 
Don't be alarmed, just wipe the sleep from your eyes 
For I've been down below, where the darkness reigns 
Doing laundry in the dark, trying to break the chainsassistant

I hope you like the song!

(Verse 1)
I stumbled through the doorway, blind and alone in the night 
The washing machine was humming, its gentle, sweet delight 
I dumped the dirty clothes inside, without a care or a thought 
Just trying to get it done, before I fell apart 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows dance and play 
I'm searching for that missing sock, in the dimly lit way 
No lights to guide my hands, just feeling my way around 
But somehow, I'll get it clean, in this darkness underground 

(Verse 2) 
The detergent's sweet aroma, fills the air like a treat 
As I fumble through the fabrics, soft and rough beneath my feet 
Whites from colors, delicates too, all blending into one 
A mystery in the making, as I sort by touch alone 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows dance and play 
I'm searching for that missing sock, in the dimly lit way 
No lights to guide my hands, just feeling my way around 
But somehow, I'll get it clean, in this darkness underground 

(Bridge) 
In the black of night, I find a peace 
A world that's hushed, where worries cease 
The rhythm of the machines, lulls me into a dream 
Where cleanliness is next to godliness, it seems 

(Chorus) 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows dance and play 
I'm searching for that missing sock, in the dimly lit way 
No lights to guide my hands, just feeling my way around 
But somehow, I'll get it clean, in this darkness underground 

(Outro) 
The cycle spins, the rinse begins 
And though I stumble, still I win 
For in the dark, I found a strange reprieve 
Doing laundry, where the heart can breathe.assistant

I'm standing here, surrounded by the night 
The washing machine's humming, an eerie light 
No dawn in sight, just shadows on the floor 
Doing laundry in the dark, like I've never done before 

(Chorus) 
Rinse and spin, rinse and spin 
In the darkness, where the lights give in 
Sorting socks and stains, without a gleam 
Laundry in the dark, it's all a dream

The fabric softener's scent is my only guide 
As I fumble through the mess, trying to abide 
The mysterious sound of water rushing by 
A midnight ritual, that reaches for the sky

In the darkness, where the lights give in 
Sorting socks and stains, without a gleam 
Laundry in the dark, it's all a dream

Free from distractions, my thoughts will cease 
Just me and the machines, in this endless space 
Doing laundry in the dark, with a secret grace

As morning breaks, the world is serene 
And though it was surreal, doing laundry at night 
It's done, and all is right.

I flipped the switch, a faint glow crept, and shadows danced on walls 
As I began to sort the clothes, with fingers that stumbled through it all 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a strange and lonely ride 
A midnight quest to clean and bright, with threads of hope inside 
I'll find my way through this load, though sightless,'t be fooled 
For in the darkness,'there's a light, that guides me through 

(Bridge) 
Like a blind man feeling his way, through the tangled mess I roam 
Whites from colors, delicates apart, I navigate this blackened room 
Stains and odors, hidden foes, that vanish like phantoms at dawn 
But tonight they taunt and tease,'t until the cycles' done 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a strange and lonely ride 
A midnight quest to clean and bright, with threads of hope inside 
I'll find my way through this load, though sightless, 'tbe fooled 
For in the darkness, there't a light, that guides me through 

(Outro) 
Now the washer's gentle thrum, subsides into peaceful hush 
Fresh and clean, the morning sun, will bring this chore to a blush 
Until then, I'll fold and stack, these secrets kept untold 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows weave a tale of goldassistant

I hope you enjoyed the song!

(Verse 1)
I stumbled into the laundry room, midnight's hue 
The only light, the glow of the washer, shining through 
A solitary figure, I stood, surrounded by the dark 
The hum of the machines, my only spark 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dead of night 
Whispers of detergent, the only sound in sight 
In the darkness, I search for whites and colors too 
Hoping not to mix them up, with nothing much to do 

(Verse 2)
The shadows danced upon the walls, as I sorted with care 
Trying to distinguish, between the lights and the dark hairs 
No help from the moon above, just the dim fluorescent glare 
But still I persevered, with soap and water to share 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dead of night 
Whispers of detergent, the only sound in sight 
In the darkness, I search for whites and colors too 
Hoping not to mix them up, with nothing much to do 

(Bridge)
Perhaps it's peaceful, this lonely, late-night chore 
No distractions, no interruptions, just me, and more 
Clean clothes emerging, like magic from the machine 
A small victory, in the dark, where I've been 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dead of night 
Whispers of detergent, the only sound in sight 
In the darkness, I search for whites and colors too 
Hoping not to mix them up, with nothing much to do 

(Outro)
As the cycle ends, and the dryer stops its spin 
I'll fold and put away, in the darkness within 
The laundry's done, in the still of the night 
And I'll face another day, with clean clothes shining bright.assistant

I hope you enjoy the song!

(Verse 1)
In the dead of night, I creep downstairs alone 
The washer's hum, in harmony with my heartbeat's tone 
I'm on a mission to conquer this never-ending chore 
Sorting whites from darks, (but it's hard to tell for sure)

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Where shadows hide each stain and spark 
No light to guide me through the cycle 
Feeling like a secret agent on a covert mission cool 

(Verse 2)
Fumbling hands trying to separate the fabrics so fine 
Risking a mistake, but hoping all will be divine 
A sock slips away, disappears into the void 
My heart skips a beat as I search, but it's nowhere employed

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Where shadows hide each stain and spark 
No light to guide me through the cycle 
Feeling like a secret agent on a covert mission cool 

(Bridge)
Tumbling drums, spinning wheels, the rhythm takes hold 
As detergent whispers secrets only known to the bold 
Amidst the darkness, a quiet thrill unfolds 
Will I emerge victorious or forever lost in this cold?

In the dead of night, I hear the call 
A mountain high, of dirty walls 
The washer's humming, like a lonely sigh 
As I sort and load, with a sleepy eye

Oh, laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride 
No sunlight to guide me, just the moon outside 
I'm searching for that missing sock, in this dimly lit space 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows take their place 

(Verse 2) 
I stumble through the room, half awake 
Trying not to trip, on that discarded mistake 
A forgotten t-shirt, crumpled on the floor 
I add it to the mix, as I wonder what's in store

Oh, laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride 
No sunlight to guide me, just the moon outside 
I'm searching for that missing sock, in this dimly lit space 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows take their place

Perhaps it's just my fate, to do the laundry late 
When the world is still asleep, and the stars are shining bright 
Maybe in the darkness, I'll find a hidden peace 
A quiet moment, all my own, to release

Oh, laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride 
No sunlight to guide me, just the moon outside 
I'm searching for that missing sock, in this dimly lit space 
Doing laundry in the dark, where shadows take their place

Fresh clothes await, though I may not be strong 
I fold and put away, in the still of the night 
 Laundry in the dark, a secret delight.assistant

(Verse 1)
I stumble through the darkness, alone and blue 
The washing machine's humming,201 it's calling me to do 
My heart is heavy with exhaustion, my eyes half closed tight 
But I know I gotta get this chore done tonight 

(Chorus) 
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Trying to find the right detergent light 
Stumbling through the shadows, soap and stains in sight 
Doing laundry in the dark, feeling like I'm losing my mind 

(Verse 2) 
I sort and separate, whites from colors too 
In the dimly lit room, I strain to see it through 
A lone sock missing its mate, my patience starts to wear 
As I search for it in vain,201 in the faint moonlight air 

(Chorus) 
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Trying to find the right detergent light 
Stumbling through the shadows, soap and stains in sight 
Doing laundry in the dark, feeling like I'm losing my mind 

(Bridge) 
Maybe I should leave it till the morning light 
When everything will seem so much clearer and bright 
But the thought of it waiting there,'til then 
Is enough to keep me going, again and again 

(Chorus) 
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Trying to find the right detergent light 
Stumbling through the shadows, soap and stains in sight 
Doing laundry in the dark, feeling like I'm losing my mind 

(Outro) 
Now the cycle's finished, all clean and fresh 
I fold and put away, what little energy I possess 
The task is done, but I won't rest easy tonight 
'Cause in the darkness, I'll still be thinking about that missing sock in flightassistant

I hope you enjoy this song!

I'm stuck in the shadows, where the lights are low and dim 
The washing machine's humming, the only sound within 
A midnight chore, with no escape from this grind 
Sorting socks and shirts, for what feels like an endless mind 

(Chorus)

Where the colors all blend, and my eyes get tired inside 
But I'll keep on sorting, through the shadows and the night 
Hoping that the dawn will bring some light to guide me right

Separate, sort, repeat, but what am I to do?

(Verse 1)
I stumbled through the door, blind as can be 
The only light, the glow of my phone's decree 
I shuffled to the washer, of uncertain fate 
Hoping I wouldn't mix the colors, (oh what a weight) 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark of night 
Guessing which soap to use,'t no delight 
Rinse and spin, fingers crossed tight 
Praying for whites that shine like light

I felt my way around the room 
Tripped on socks that smelled like doom 
I tossed them in with reckless pride 
Wishing I could see the stains inside

Guessing which soap to use,'t no delight 
Rinse and spin, fingers crossed tight 
Praying for whites that shine like light

Will my clothes come out stained or small?

(Verse 1)
I'm stumbling through the darkness,night's descent has begun 
The lights are out, but I've got to get it done 
The washer's humming, a gentle guide 
As I feel my way, with socks inside 

(Chorus) 
Laundry in the dark, it's a curious sight 
Sorting whites from colors, by the faint moonlight 
I'll wash and rinse, and hope for the best 
Praying that my clothes come out looking their best 

(Verse 2) 
I trip on dirty sheets, and tumble to the floor 
The detergent box, a beacon in the dark once more 
I pour and measure, with hands that tremble slow 
And wonder if my jeans will ever smell like snow

Laundry in the dark, it's a curious sight 
Sorting whites from colors, by the faint moonlight 
I'll wash and rinse, and hope for the best 
Praying that my clothes come out looking their best

In this blackness, I find a peaceful place 
Where the hum of machines, becomes a soothing grace 
A moment's solitude, amidst the daily grind 
Just me, the shadows, and this endless pile of kind

Laundry in the dark, it's a curious sight 
Sorting whites from colors, by the faint moonlight 
I'll wash and rinse, and hope for the best 
Praying that my clothes come out looking their best

The cycle ends, the dawn begins anew 
I'll fold and put away, with a heart that's true 
Perhaps someday, I'll master this chore 
But for now, I'll cherish, laundry in the dark once moreassistant

Midnight whispers, secrets to me alone 
As I creep downstairs, where shadows have grown 
The washer's hum, a lullaby sweet 
A solo serenade, to my laundry treat

Where the machines hum, and my worries cease

Morning light will bring, what secrets I'll repeat

Doing laundry in the dark, where love and duty growassistant

I'm stuck in the darkness, with soap and despair 
A load of dirty secrets, nobody cares 
The washing machine's humming, but I'm lost in the night 
Sorting socks by feel, without a glimmer of light 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark, it's a lonely ride

No fluorescent glow, just me and the stain 
Hoping I don't mess up, as I stumble through the pain

Shirts and towels tangled, like my thoughts in my head 
Can't see what I'm doing, but the sweat is on my bed

Will it be clean and bright, or another dirty throne?

(Verse 1)
I stumbled through the darkness, alone and unaware 
The lights were out, but my dirty clothes were still there 
No glow of whites,200 detergent's gentle shine 
Just me, the washer, and this endless load of mine 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark,'t no easy feat 
Fumbling for socks and tangled sheets at my feet 
But I'll get it done, somehow,'t gonna let it beat 
In the black of night, my laundry will retreat 

(Verse 2)
I sorted by feel,'t quite sure what's what 
Hoping my delicates don't meet an untimely cut 
A sock went missing, or so it would seem 
But I pressed on,'t time to dwell on laundry dreams 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark,'t no easy feat 
Fumbling for socks and tangled sheets at my feet 
But I'll get it done,'t gonna let it beat 
In the black of night, my laundry will retreat 

(Bridge)
Maybe I should light some candles bright 
Or call on the moon to lend its silvery light 
But I'll push through, the dark won't bring me down 
Clean clothes await, come morning's early crown 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark,'t no easy feat 
Fumbling for socks and tangled sheets at my feet 
But I'll get it done,t gonna let it beat 
In the black of night,'t my laundry will retreat 

(Outro)
The cycle's done,'t the rinse and spin 
I'll fold and put away, when the dawn creeps in 
Perhaps tomorrow, I'll find that stray sock too 
But tonight, in the dark, it's all brand new!assistant

I hope you enjoyed the song!
