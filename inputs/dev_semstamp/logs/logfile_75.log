Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, the Mother of Dragons! In the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, Daenerys undergoes a significant transformation in the final season.

After seasons of being portrayed as a heroic and just character, Daenerys's actions take a dark turn in Season 8. Her descent into madness and tyranny can be attributed to several factors:

1. **The death of Missandei**: The beheading of her loyal friend and advisor, Missandei, by Cersei's orders is a devastating blow to Daenerys.
2. **The betrayal of Varys**: Lord Varys, another trusted advisor, begins to question Daenerys's judgment and eventually tries to persuade Jon Snow to take the Iron Throne instead.

Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, the Mother of Dragons! In the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, Daenerys undergoes a significant transformation in the final season.

After seasons of being portrayed as a heroic and just character, Daenerys's actions take a dark turn in Season 8. Her descent into madness and tyranny can be attributed to several factors:

1. **The death of Missandei**: The beheading of her loyal friend and advisor, Missandei, by Cersei's orders is a devastating blow to Daenerys.
2. **The betrayal of Varys**: Lord Varys, another trusted advisor, begins to question Daenerys's judgment and eventually tries to persuade Jon Snow to take the Iron Throne instead. This perceived betrayal further destabilizes Daenerys.
