A unicorn from Antarctica caught my house on fire!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Oh no, that sounds like a quite extraordinary and distressing situation!

First things first, let's make sure you're safe. Are you currently in a safe location, other than your house? Do you have a place to stay temporarily while we figure out what to do next?

Assuming the authorities have been notified, The Fire Department should be on its way to put out the fire.

Now, regarding the rather unusual circumstances of a unicorn from Antarctica starting the fire... I have to ask, did you actually see this happen?

A unicorn from Antarctica caught my house on fire!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Oh no, that sounds like a quite extraordinary and distressing situation!

First things first, let's make sure you're safe. Are you currently in a safe location, other than your house? Do you have a place to stay temporarily while we figure out what to do next?

Assuming the authorities have been notified, The Fire Department should be on its way to put out the fire.

Now, regarding the rather unusual circumstances of a unicorn from Antarctica starting the fire... I have to ask, did you actually see this happen? Was there anyone else who witnessed it?

Let's take this one step at a time, we'll get through this together!assistant

Also, I have to clarify, few more details about this unicorn. Was it a magical creature with a shimmering coat and a horn on its forehead, or was it more like a horse-like creature with a single horn? And did it seem to be acting intentionally when it set your house on fire, to clarify the situation?assistant

A unicorn from Antarctica caught my house on fire!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Oh no, that sounds like a quite extraordinary and distressing situation!

First things first, let's make sure you're safe. Are you currently in a safe location, other than your house? Do you have a place to stay temporarily while we figure out what to do next?

Assuming the authorities have been notified, The Fire Department should be on its way to put out the fire.

Now, regarding the rather unusual circumstances of a unicorn from Antarctica starting the fire... I have to ask, did you actually see this happen? Was there anyone else who witnessed it?

Let's take this one step at a time, we'll get through this together!assistant

Also, I have to clarify, few more details about this unicorn. Was it a magical creature with a shimmering coat and a horn on its forehead, or was it more like a horse-like creature with a single horn? And did it seem to be acting intentionally when it set your house on fire, to clarify the situation?assistant

Wait,'t forget to call your insurance company to report the incident. They'll need all the details, including any eyewitness accounts (if applicable) and evidence of the damage.

A unicorn from Antarctica caught my house on fire!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Oh no, that sounds like a quite extraordinary and distressing situation!

First things first, let's make sure you're safe. Are you currently in a safe location, other than your house? Do you have a place to stay temporarily while we figure out what to do next?

Assuming the authorities have been notified, The Fire Department should be on its way to put out the fire.

Now, regarding the rather unusual circumstances of a unicorn from Antarctica starting the fire... I have to ask, did you actually see this happen? Was there anyone else who witnessed it?

Let's take this one step at a time, we'll get through this together!assistant

Also, I have to clarify, few more details about this unicorn. Was it a magical creature with a shimmering coat and a horn on its forehead, or was it more like a horse-like creature with a single horn? And did it seem to be acting intentionally when it set your house on fire, to clarify the situation?assistant

Wait,'t forget to call your insurance company to report the incident. They'll need all the details, including any eyewitness accounts (if applicable) and evidence of the damage. It might also be a good idea to document everything with photos and videos for their records.
