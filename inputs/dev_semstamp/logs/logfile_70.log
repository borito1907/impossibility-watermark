Let's solve the quadratic equation step by step:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

Subtract 4 from both sides to get:

2x^2 = 8

Next, divide both sides by 2 to get:

x^2 = 4

Now, take the square root of both sides to get:

x = ±√4

x = ±2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 2 and x = -2.assistant

Let's solve the equation step by step:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2x^2 = 8

Divide both sides by 2:

x^2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides:

x = ±√4

x = ±2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 2 and x = -2.assistant

Solve 2x^2 + 4 = 12<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's solve the quadratic equation:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

Subtract 4 from both sides to get:

2x^2 = 8

Divide both sides by 2 to get:

x^2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides to get:

x = ±√4

x = ±2

So, the solutions are x = 2 and x = -2!assistant

You are a helpful personal assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Solve 2x^2 + 4 = 12<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's solve the quadratic equation:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

Subtract 4 from both sides to get:

2x^2 = 8

Divide both sides by 2 to get:

x^2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides to get:

x = ±√4

x = ±2

So, the solutions are x = 2 and x = -2!assistant
