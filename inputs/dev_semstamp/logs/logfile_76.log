What is Kolmogorov 0-1 law?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Kolmogorov 0-1 law, also known as the zero-one law, is a fundamental result in probability theory, named after Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

In essence, it states that for any event (a set of outcomes) in a probability space, the probability of that event occurring is either 0 or 1, provided that the event is invariant under certain transformations.

What is Kolmogorov 0-1 law?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Kolmogorov 0-1 law, also known as the zero-one law, is a fundamental result in probability theory, named after Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

In essence, it states that for any event (a set of outcomes) in a probability space, the probability of that event occurring is either 0 or 1, provided that the event is invariant under certain transformations.

To be more precise, let's consider an ergodic system, which is a mathematical model used to describe systems that are evolving randomly over time. In such systems, the Kolmogorov 0-1 law asserts that if an event is invariant under the dynamics of the system (i.e., its occurrence does not change over time), then its probability is either:

1.
