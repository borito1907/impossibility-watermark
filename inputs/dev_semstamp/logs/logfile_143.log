Here are some arguments for both sides of the debate on whether AI has adversely affected people's lives:

**Arguments for "AI has adversely affected people's lives":**

1. **Job Displacement**: The increasing use of AI and automation in various industries has led to job losses, (e.g., self-service kiosks replacing cashiers, it jobs replaced by chatbots). This has resulted in significant economic disruption for many individuals and families.
2. **Privacy Concerns**: AI-powered surveillance systems and data collection practices have raised serious concerns about privacy infringement. People's personal data is being collected and used without their consent or knowledge,1984-style surveillance.
3. **Mental Health Impacts**: Excessive screen time and social media usage enabled by AI-driven interfaces have been linked to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among individuals, a vicious cycle of comparison and validation-seeking behavior.
