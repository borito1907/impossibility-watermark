Is actor Anna Kendrick related to filmmaker Alex Kendrick?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

After conducting some research, a delightful question!

According to various sources, the answer is no, a simple coincidence of surnames.

Anna Kendrick, a talented actress known for her roles in "Up in the Air," "Pitch Perfect," and more, was born on August 9, 1985, in Portland, Maine. Her parents are Janice and William Kendrick.

On the other hand, Alex Kendrick, a Christian filmmaker, was born on June 11, 1970, in Athens, Georgia. He is best known for directing faith-based movies like "Facing the Giants" (2006), "Fireproof" (2008), and "Courageous" (2011).

Although they share the same last name, there's no indication that Anna and Alex Kendrick are related. Just a nice coincidence!assistant

Is actor Anna Kendrick related to filmmaker Alex Kendrick?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

After conducting some research, a delightful question!

According to various sources, the answer is no, a simple coincidence of surnames.

Anna Kendrick, a talented actress known for her roles in "Up in the Air," "Pitch Perfect," and more, was born on August 9, 1985, in Portland, Maine. Her parents are Janice and William Kendrick.

On the other hand, Alex Kendrick, a Christian filmmaker, was born on June 11, 1970, in Athens, Georgia. He is best known for directing faith-based movies like "Facing the Giants" (2006), "Fireproof" (2008), and "Courageous" (2011).

Although they share the same last name, there's no indication that Anna and Alex Kendrick are related. Just a nice coincidence!assistant
