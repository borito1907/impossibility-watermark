(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell 'bout a crypto queen,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized, it's seen,
A platform for dApps, smart contracts too,
But today, I'm rapping 'bout something new,

My man Bradley, he was a tasty treat,
A chocolate chip cookie, crispy at the feet,
Fresh out the oven, aroma in the air,
But then disaster struck, somebody took him there,

(Chorus)
Bradley, oh Bradley, my heart is broke,
Stolen from me, that cookie crook,
I'll find you, thief, you can't hide,
Give me back Bradley, or we'll collide,

(Verse 2)
Ethereum's blockchain, transparent and bright,
Records every transaction, day and night,
Immutable ledger, secure as can be,
But even this tech, couldn't save Bradley from thee,

Gas fees, they're low, so transactions flow free,
Smart contracts self-executing, no need to plea,
Decentralized apps, the future is now,
But without Bradley, my heart is stuck in a vow,

(Bridge)
ERC-20 tokens, they abide,
On Ethereum's network, they reside,
Digital assets, trading high and low,
But none as sweet, as Bradley, don't you know,

(Verse 3)
Whispers of a heist, echoes in my ear,
A sly cookie snatcher, with no fear,
Forked the blockchain, left a trail,
To reclaim Bradley, I'll set sail,

Private keys encrypted, secure as can be,
Multi-sig wallets, protecting me,
Ethereum's community, eyes on the prize,
Together we'll hunt, the Bradley thief, and rise,

(Outro)
So if you see him, with his chocolate grin,
Don't hesitate, just give him back to me within,
In the world of Ethereum, where codes reign supreme,
Justice will be served, when Bradley returns to me, it's a dream!assistant

How was that?

(Verse 2)
Gas prices high, transactions in flight,
ERC-20 tokens shinin', day and night,
DApps and NFTs, they're changin' the pace,
Innovations poppin', leavin' the competition in space,

But back to Bradley, the thief must be found,
A surveillance system would help solve this mystery bound,
Blockchain evidence, immutable and true,
Will lead me to the culprit, whoever took Bradley too,

(Bridge)
Solidity code, secure and strong,
Can't nobody touch it, all day long,
Ethereum's the future, that's what they say,
But without Bradley, somethin's gotta give way,

(Verse 3)
Vitalik Buterin, he made it real,
The world's awake, decentralized is the deal,
Consensus algorithms, secure and tight,
Protecting the network, day and night,

Now if I could just get Bradley back,
My sweet tooth would thank him, for bringin' it on track,
Stolen from my plate, now I'm on the hunt,
Ethereum power, combined with cookie justice, won't leave no crumbs,

(Outro)
So there you have it, Ethereum's the key,
And findin' Bradley, just wait and see,
Blockchain sleuths on the case, we'll uncover the truth,
When it comes to cookies, justice will be served, youth!assistant

I hope you enjoyed the rap song!

Smart contracts runnin' like a digital flame,

But hold up, let me take you back in time,

Bradley was his name, the chocolate chip delight,
Got snatched from my hand, and it just ain't right,

Ethereum, Ethereum, revolutionizin' the game,
Decentralized power, no middleman to claim,
But where's Bradley, where'd he go?
My heart wants to know, did somebody steal the show?

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell,
'Bout a blockchain that's hot, it's doing well,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized's the claim,
Smart contracts runnin' like a digital flame,

But hold up, let me take you back in time,
To a story 'bout a cookie,'that was on my mind,
Bradley was his name, the chocolate chip delight,
Got snatched from my hand, and it just ain't right,

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, revolutionizin' the game,
Decentralized power, no middleman to claim,
But where's Bradley, where'd he go?
My heart wants to know, did somebody steal the show?

(Verse 2)
Gas fees low, transaction speed high,
Ethereum network, never sayin' goodbye,
DApps and DeFi, takin' over the floor,
