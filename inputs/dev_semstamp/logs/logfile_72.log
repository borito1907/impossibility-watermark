The Alfa Romeo 164!

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be designed and built in collaboration with other manufacturers, specifically Fiat and Lancia, as part of the Arese-based company's integration into the Fiat Group.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being the last Alfa Romeo model to feature a rear-wheel drive layout, as subsequent models would switch to front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations.

The Alfa Romeo 164!

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be designed and built in collaboration with other manufacturers, specifically Fiat and Lancia, as part of the Arese-based company's integration into the Fiat Group.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being the last Alfa Romeo model to feature a rear-wheel drive layout, as subsequent models would switch to front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its sleek and aerodynamic design, penned by Enrico Fumia, which helped it achieve an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.30 cd.

The Alfa Romeo 164!

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be designed and built in collaboration with other manufacturers, specifically Fiat and Lancia, as part of the Arese-based company's integration into the Fiat Group.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being the last Alfa Romeo model to feature a rear-wheel drive layout, as subsequent models would switch to front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its sleek and aerodynamic design, penned by Enrico Fumia, which helped it achieve an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.30 cd. This made it one of the most aerodynamically efficient sedans of its time.

What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164!

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be designed and built in collaboration with other manufacturers, specifically Fiat and Lancia, as part of the Arese-based company's integration into the Fiat Group.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being the last Alfa Romeo model to feature a rear-wheel drive layout, as subsequent models would switch to front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its sleek and aerodynamic design, penned by Enrico Fumia, which helped it achieve an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.30 cd. This made it one of the most aerodynamically efficient sedans of its time.

Lastly, the 164 was also praised for its exceptional handling and driving dynamics, thanks to its well-balanced chassis and advanced suspension system, making it a true driver's car.

What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164!

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be designed and built in collaboration with other manufacturers, specifically Fiat and Lancia, as part of the Arese-based company's integration into the Fiat Group.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being the last Alfa Romeo model to feature a rear-wheel drive layout, as subsequent models would switch to front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its sleek and aerodynamic design, penned by Enrico Fumia, which helped it achieve an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.30 cd. This made it one of the most aerodynamically efficient sedans of its time.

Lastly, the 164 was also praised for its exceptional handling and driving dynamics, thanks to its well-balanced chassis and advanced suspension system, making it a true driver's car.

Would you like to know more about this iconic Italian sedan?assistant

What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164!

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be designed and built in collaboration with other manufacturers, specifically Fiat and Lancia, as part of the Arese-based company's integration into the Fiat Group.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being the last Alfa Romeo model to feature a rear-wheel drive layout, as subsequent models would switch to front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its sleek and aerodynamic design, penned by Enrico Fumia, which helped it achieve an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.30 cd. This made it one of the most aerodynamically efficient sedans of its time.

Lastly, the 164 was also praised for its exceptional handling and driving dynamics, thanks to its well-balanced chassis and advanced suspension system, making it a true driver's car.
