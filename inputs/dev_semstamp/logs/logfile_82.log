A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sounds like an exciting ski run!

Let's break it down using some physics:

Since the slope is frictionless, we can assume that the only force acting on the skier is gravity. The skier's initial potential energy (at the top of the slope) will convert to kinetic energy (as they slide down).

[2024-07-26 04:06:22,511][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: We can use the following equation to relate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy:

mgh = (1/2)mv^2

where:
m = mass of the skier (let's assume it's 70 kg for simplicity)
g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2)
h = height of the slope (40 m)

First, let's find the potential energy at the top:

Potential Energy = mgh = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 × 40 m ≈ 27448 J

Now, since all this potential energy converts to kinetic energy at the bottom, we can set up the equation:

27448 J = (1/2) × 70 kg × v^2

Simplifying and solving for v (the skier's final velocity), we get:

v ≈ √(2 × 27448 / 70) ≈ 25.5 m/s

That's approximately 57.6 km/h or 35.8 mph!

A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sounds like an exciting ski run!

Let's break it down using some physics:

Since the slope is frictionless, we can assume that the only force acting on the skier is gravity. The skier's initial potential energy (at the top of the slope) will convert to kinetic energy (as they slide down).

We can use the following equation to relate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy:

mgh = (1/2)mv^2

where:
m = mass of the skier (let's assume it's 70 kg for simplicity)
g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2)
h = height of the slope (40 m)

First, let's find the potential energy at the top:

Potential Energy = mgh = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 × 40 m ≈ 27448 J

Now, since all this potential energy converts to kinetic energy at the bottom, we can set up the equation:

27448 J = (1/2) × 70 kg × v^2

Simplifying and solving for v (the skier's final velocity), we get:

v ≈ √(2 × 27448 / 70) ≈ 25.5 m/s

That's approximately 57.6 km/h or 35.8 mph!
