If you're still undecided, (or want to mix and match elements), I can suggest some prompts to get us started:

* A hidden treasure on a mysterious island

* A detective trying to solve a puzzling crime in a futuristic city 

Feel free to pick any of these, there, modify them, or give me a completely new idea!

If you're still undecided, (or want to mix and match elements), I can suggest some prompts to get us started:

* A hidden treasure on a mysterious island 
* A group of friends discovering a supernatural power 
* A detective trying to solve a puzzling crime in a futuristic city
