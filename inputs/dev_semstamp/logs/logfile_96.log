James Weggie! From what I found, the name "James Weggie" seems to be associated with a few individuals, (which one are you referring to?)

Here are a couple of notable ones:

1. **James Weggie (footballer)**: James Weggie was a Scottish footballer who played as a winger for clubs like Heart of Midlothian and Falkirk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

2. **James Weggie (Australian rules footballer)**: There's also an Australian rules footballer named James Weggie, to whom I couldn't find much information. If you're looking for more details about him, please let me know!

If none of these match the James Weggie you're thinking of,'t hesitate to provide more context or information, and I'll do my best to help you out!assistant

I see you didn't mention any specific context, so I provided general information about notable individuals with that name.
