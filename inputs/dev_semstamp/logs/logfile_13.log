To configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND in bridge mode, follow these steps:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure to connect your computer to one of the LAN ports on the router using an Ethernet cable.

**Step 1: Log in to the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser and type `http://tplinkwifi.net` or `192.168.0.1` (the default IP address of the router).
2. Enter the admin username and password (default is `admin` for both).

**Step 2: Navigate to the Bridge Mode Settings**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup**.

Configurare in modalità bridge router tplink td-w8950nd<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND in bridge mode, follow these steps:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure to connect your computer to one of the LAN ports on the router using an Ethernet cable.

**Step 1: Log in to the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser and type `http://tplinkwifi.net` or `192.168.0.1` (the default IP address of the router).
2. Enter the admin username and password (default is `admin` for both).

**Step 2: Navigate to the Bridge Mode Settings**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup**.
2. Select **LAN Settings** from the submenu.
3. Scroll down to the **Bridge Mode** section.

**Step 3: Enable Bridge Mode**

To configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND in bridge mode, follow these steps:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure to connect your computer to one of the LAN ports on the router using an Ethernet cable.

**Step 1: Log in to the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser and type `http://tplinkwifi.net` or `192.168.0.1` (the default IP address of the router).
2. Enter the admin username and password (default is `admin` for both).

**Step 2: Navigate to the Bridge Mode Settings**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup**.
2. Select **LAN Settings** from the submenu.
3. Scroll down to the **Bridge Mode** section.

**Step 3: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Check the box next to **Enable Bridge Mode**.
2. Set the **Bridge Mode Type** to **Wireless AP** (if you want to use the router as a wireless access point) or **Wired AP** (if you want to use it as a wired access point).
