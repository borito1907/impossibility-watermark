We'll use spherical coordinates (θ, φ) to parameterize the sphere, where:
	* θ is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis)

The Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) can be expressed as functions of θ and φ:

x = r \* sin(θ) \* cos(φ)
y = r \* sin(θ) \* sin(φ)
z = r \* cos(θ)

**Step 2: Find the Jacobian Matrix**

To convert the integral from spherical to Cartesian coordinates, we need the Jacobian matrix (J):

J = ∂(x, y, z)/∂(θ, φ) =
[ -r \* sin(θ) \* sin(φ),   r \* sin(θ) \* cos(φ),    -r \* cos(θ) ]
[  r \* sin(θ) \* cos(φ),  r \* sin(θ) \* sin(φ),     r \* cos(θ) ]
[ -r \* cos(θ),             -r \* sin(θ),              r \* sin(θ) ]

**Step 3: Calculate the Surface Area Element**

The surface area element (dA) can be found by taking the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to θ and φ:

dA = |∂x/∂θ × ∂x/∂φ + ∂y/∂θ × ∂y/∂φ + ∂z/∂θ × ∂z/∂φ| dθ dφ

Using the chain rule and simplifying, we get:

dA = r^2 \* sin(θ) dθ dφ

**Step 4: Integrate over the Surface**

Now, integrate the surface area element over the entire surface of the sphere:

A = ∫[0, π] ∫[0, 2π] r^2 \* sin(θ) dθ dφ

Evaluate the integral:

A = 2π \* r^2 ∫[0, π] sin(θ) dθ

Substitute u = cos(θ), du/dθ = -sin(θ):

A = 2π \* r^2 [-u]^π_0

A = 2π \* r^2 (1 - (-1))

A = **4πr^2**

**Step 4: Compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix**

Compute the determinant of J, denoted by |J|:

|J| = (-r \* sin(φ) \* sin(θ)) \* (r \* cos(φ) \* sin(θ)) - (r \* sin(φ) \* cos(θ)) \* (-r \* sin(φ))
= r^2 \* sin^2(φ)

**Step 5: Integrate over the sphere**

The surface area element dA can be written as:

dA = |J| dθ dφ = r^2 \* sin^2(φ) dθ dφ

Now, integrate dA over the entire sphere:

A = ∫[0, 2π] ∫[0, π] r^2 \* sin^2(φ) dθ dφ

= ∫[0, 2π] [r^2 \* sin^2(φ)] \* [θ]_{θ=0}^{θ=2π} dφ

= 2π \* ∫[0, π] r^2 \* sin^2(φ) dφ

= 2π \* [-r^2 \* cos(φ) / 2]_{φ=0}^{φ=π}

= 4π \* r^2

**Result:**

The surface area of the sphere is:

A = 4π \* r^2

Since we're dealing with a sphere of radius r, to simplify things, we can set ρ = r.

**Step 2: Find the Position Vector and its Partial Derivatives**

Let's define the position vector **R**(φ, θ) from the origin to a point on the sphere:

**R**(φ, θ) = <r \* sin(φ) \* cos(θ), r \* sin(φ) \* sin(θ), r \* cos(φ)>

Now, let's compute the partial derivatives of **R** with respect to φ and θ:

∂**R**/∂φ = <-r \* sin(φ) \* sin(θ), r \* sin(φ) \* cos(θ), -r \* sin(φ)>
∂**R**/∂θ = <-r \* sin^2(φ) \* sin(θ), r \* sin^2(φ) \* cos(θ), 0>

**Step 3: Calculate the Surface Area Element**

To find the surface area element dA, we need to compute the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives:

dA = ||(∂**R**/∂φ × ∂**R**/∂θ)|| \* dφ \* dθ

Using the properties of the cross product, we get:

dA = |(-r \* sin(φ) \* sin(θ))^2 + (r \* sin(φ) \* cos(θ))^2 + (-r \* sin(φ))^2|^(1/2) \* dφ \* dθ

Simplifying, we obtain:

dA = r^2 \* sin(φ) \* dφ \* dθ

**Step 4: Integrate to Find the Total Surface Area**

Finally, we integrate dA over the entire sphere to find the total surface area A:

A = ∫[0, π] ∫[0, 2π] r^2 \* sin(φ) \* dφ \* dθ

Evaluating the integral, we get:

A = 2π \* r^2 \* [-cos(φ)]|[0, π]
= 2π \* r^2 \* [1 + (-1)]
= 4π \* r^2
