       setEmailError(true);
     } else {
       // proceed with submission logic 
     }
   };
   ```

Here's a simple example of how you could use the above approaches:

**HTML5 Form Validation**

```javascript   
import React from'react';

const MyForm = () => {
   
return (
    <form>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type=""text"" required />
      </label>
      <br />
      <label>
        Email:
        <input type=""email"" required />
      </label>
      <br />
      <button type=""submit"">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default MyForm;
```

**Using useForm from react-hook-form**

```javascript   
import { useForm } from'react-hook-form';

const MyForm = () => {
  const { register, errors } = useForm();

  return (
    <form>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input {...register('name', { required: true })} />
        {errors.name && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>
      <br />
      <label>
        Email:
        <input {...register('email', { required: true, pattern: /^\S+@\S+\.+[a-z]+$/i })} />
        {errors.email && <span>Invalid email address</span>}
      </label>
      <br />
      <button type=""submit"">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default MyForm;
```

Remember, always validate user input both on the client-side and server-side for security reasons.
