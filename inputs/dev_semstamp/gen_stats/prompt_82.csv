72,"We can use the following equation to relate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy:

mgh = (1/2)mv^2

where:
m = mass of the skier (let's assume it's 70 kg for simplicity)
g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2)
h = height of the slope (40 m)

First, let's find the potential energy at the top:

Potential Energy = mgh = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 × 40 m ≈ 27448 J

Now, since all this potential energy converts to kinetic energy at the bottom, we can set up the equation:

27448 J = (1/2) × 70 kg × v^2

Simplifying and solving for v (the skier's final velocity), we get:

v ≈ √(2 × 27448 / 70) ≈ 25.5 m/s

That's approximately 57.6 km/h or 35.8 mph!",True,2,"5,2",True,3
