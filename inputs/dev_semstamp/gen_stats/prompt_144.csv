(Verse 1)
I woke up to the sound of silence, it was dead of night 
The stars were shining bright outside my window light 
But I knew what had to be done, a task that couldn't wait 
So I stumbled through the darkness, to the laundry fate 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, with shadows all around 
The washing machine's gentle hum, the only sound 
I'm searching for the whites and colors, in this dimly lit space 
Hoping I don't mix them up, as I sort with a tired face 

(Verse 2)
The room was bathed in moonlight, an eerie, silver glow 
As I loaded up the washer, with socks and shirts to go 
The detergent packet crinkled, like a whisper in my ear 
Reminding me of all the tasks, that I'd rather hold dear 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, with shadows all around 
The washing machine's gentle hum, the only sound 
I'm searching for the whites and colors, in this dimly lit space 
Hoping I don't mix them up, as I sort with a tired face 

(Bridge)
Perhaps I'll find a magic trick, to make this chore disappear 
Or maybe I'll just dream of clean clothes, without a single fear 
But till then, I'll stumble on, through this dark of night 
And hope that morning comes soon, when the light will shine so bright 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dark, with shadows all around 
The washing machine's gentle hum, the only sound 
I'm searching for the whites and colors, in this dimly lit space 
Hoping I don't mix them up, as I sort with a tired face 

(Outro)
Now the cycle's complete, the dirty's gone away 
As I fold and put them back, come dawn of a brand new day 
The darkness fades to nothing, as morning takes its place 
And I'll remember this strange night, with a smile on my face.assistant

In the black of night, I'm searching high and low 
For that missing sock, the one that's gone with the flow 

(Verse 2) 
I load up the dryer, with a flicker of faith 
Hoping all will turn out right, no stains or wrinkles in place 
In this midnight hour, when the world is still asleep

I stumbled into the laundry room, midnight's hue 
The only light, the glow of the washer, shining through 
A solitary figure, I stood, surrounded by the dark 
The hum of the machines, my only spark 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dead of night 
Whispers of detergent, the only sound in sight 
In the darkness, I search for whites and colors too 
Hoping not to mix them up, with nothing much to do 

(Verse 2)
The shadows danced upon the walls, as I sorted with care 
Trying to distinguish, between the lights and the dark hairs 
No help from the moon above, just the dim fluorescent glare 
But still I persevered, with soap and water to share 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dead of night 
Whispers of detergent, the only sound in sight 
In the darkness, I search for whites and colors too 
Hoping not to mix them up, with nothing much to do 

(Bridge)
Perhaps it's peaceful, this lonely, late-night chore 
No distractions, no interruptions, just me, and more 
Clean clothes emerging, like magic from the machine 
A small victory, in the dark, where I've been 

(Chorus)
Doing laundry in the dead of night 
Whispers of detergent, the only sound in sight 
In the darkness, I search for whites and colors too 
Hoping not to mix them up, with nothing much to do 

(Outro)
As the cycle ends, and the dryer stops its spin 
I'll fold and put away, in the darkness within 
The laundry's done, in the still of the night 
And I'll face another day, with clean clothes shining bright.assistant

(Verse 1)
In the dead of night, I creep downstairs alone 
The washer's hum, in harmony with my heartbeat's tone 
I'm on a mission to conquer this never-ending chore 
Sorting whites from darks, (but it's hard to tell for sure)

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Where shadows hide each stain and spark 
No light to guide me through the cycle 
Feeling like a secret agent on a covert mission cool 

(Verse 2)
Fumbling hands trying to separate the fabrics so fine 
Risking a mistake, but hoping all will be divine 
A sock slips away, disappears into the void 
My heart skips a beat as I search, but it's nowhere employed

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark 
Where shadows hide each stain and spark 
No light to guide me through the cycle 
Feeling like a secret agent on a covert mission cool 

(Bridge)
Tumbling drums, spinning wheels, the rhythm takes hold 
As detergent whispers secrets only known to the bold 
Amidst the darkness, a quiet thrill unfolds 
Will I emerge victorious or forever lost in this cold?

Trying not to trip, on that discarded mistake 
A forgotten t-shirt, crumpled on the floor

When the world is still asleep, and the stars are shining bright 
Maybe in the darkness, I'll find a hidden peace 
A quiet moment, all my own, to release
