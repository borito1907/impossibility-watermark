The given equation is:
sin⁷(x) + 1/sin³(x) = cos⁷(x) + 1/cos³(x)

First, let's simplify the fractions using the reciprocal identity:

1/sin³(x) = csc³(x) and 1/cos³(x) = sec³(x)

So, the equation becomes:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Now, recall the Pythagorean identities:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

Cubing both sides (which is valid since it's an identity):
(sin²(x) + cos²(x))³ = 1³

Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem:
sin⁶(x) + 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) + 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1

Rearranging terms:
sin⁶(x) + cos⁶(x) = 1 - 3sin⁴(x)cos²(x) - 3sin²(x)cos⁴(x)

Notice that we can rewrite the original equation as:
sin⁷(x) + csc³(x) = cos⁷(x) + sec³(x)

Multiplying both sides by sin³(x)cos³(x) to eliminate the fractions:
sin¹⁰(x) + cos³(x) = cos¹⁰(x) + sin³(x)

Now, substitute the expressions from the Pythagorean identity expansion:
sin⁶(x)sin⁴(x) + cos³(x) = cos⁶(x)cos⁴(x) + sin³(x)

Rearrange terms again:
sin⁶(x)sin⁴(x) - cos⁶(x)cos⁴(x) = sin³(x) - cos³(x)

Factor out sin³(x) - cos³(x):
(sin³(x) - cos³(x))(sin⁴(x) + cos⁴(x) + 1) = 0

This tells us that either:
sin³(x) - cos³(x) = 0... (A)
or:
sin⁴(x) + cos⁴(x) + 1 = 0... (B)

Equation (A) gives us:
sin³(x) = cos³(x)
Taking the cube root of both sides:
sin(x) = cos(x)

Which implies x = π/4 or x = 5π/4 (since sin(x) = cos(x) in these quadrants).

$$\frac{\cos^3(x) + \sin^{10}(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)} = \frac{\sin^3(x) + \cos^{10}(x)}{\sin^3(x)\cos^3(x)}$$

Next, simplify the numerators using the Pythagorean identity (sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1):

Now, equate the numerators (since the denominators are the same on both sides):

$$1 - 5\cos^2(x) + 10\cos^4(x) - 5\cos^6(x) + \cos^8(x) = 1 - 5\sin^2(x) + 10\sin^4(x) - 5\sin^6(x) + \sin^8(x)$$

Subtract 1 from both sides and rearrange terms:

$$- 5(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) + 10(\cos^4(x) - \sin^4(x)) - 5(\cos^6(x) - \sin^6(x)) + (\cos^8(x) - \sin^8(x)) = 0$$

Factor out -5 and use the double-angle formulas:

Recall that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1... ( Pythagorean identity )

We can rewrite this identity as:
1 = sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)
=> 1 = sin^2(x) / sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) / cos^2(x)
=> 1 = (1/sin^2(x)) + (1/cos^2(x))

Raise both sides to the power of 3/2 (rational exponent):

1^(3/2) = ((1/sin^2(x)) + (1/cos^2(x)))^(3/2)
=> 1 = (1/sin^3(x)) + (1/cos^3(x))

Subtract 1 from both sides:

0 = (1/sin^3(x)) - 1 + (1/cos^3(x)) - 1

Rearrange terms:

0 = (1/sin^3(x) - 1) + (1/cos^3(x) - 1)

Factor out -1 from each parentheses:

0 = -(1 - 1/sin^3(x)) - (1 - 1/cos^3(x))
=> 0 = -sin^3(x)/sin^3(x) + 1 + cos^3(x)/cos^3(x) - 1

Simplify:

0 = -sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)

Now, recall another useful identity:
sin(A) + cos(A) = √2 \* sin(A + π/4)

Replace A with x and multiply both sides by -1:

-cos(x) + sin(x) = √2 \* sin(x - π/4)

Cubing both sides (note: cubing is not always straightforward, but in this case, it works out nicely):

-(cos^3(x)) + sin^3(x) = (√2)^3 \* sin^3(x - π/4)

Compare this with our simplified equation:
0 = -sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)

It's evident that:

sin^3(x - π/4) = 0

Subtracting $\cos^2(x)$ from both sides gives us: $\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)$

Raise both sides to the power of 5 (to match the exponents in our original equation):

Using the binomial theorem or simply expanding the expression, we get:

Using the Pythagorean identity, we know that:

Now, substitute these expressions into the original equation:

Rearrange the terms to get:

We can rewrite this identity in a more useful form for our equation:

cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)

Raise both sides to the power of -3/2:

cos^(-3)(x) = (1 - sin^2(x))^(-3/2)

$$\sin^6 x \sin x + 1 = \cos^6 x \cos x + 1$$

Subtract $1$ from both sides:

$$\sin^6 x \sin x = \cos^6 x \cos x$$

Divide both sides by $\sin x \cos x$ (assuming $x$ is not a multiple of $\pi/2$ or $\pi$):

$$\sin^5 x \cos x = \cos^5 x \sin x$$

Now, use the identity $\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x)$:

$$\sin^5 x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x) = \cos^5 x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin(2x)$$

Since $\sin(2x)$ cannot be zero for all $x$, we can divide both sides by it:

$$\sin^5 x = \cos^5 x$$

Take the fifth root of both sides:

$$\sin x = \cos x$$

This implies:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}$$

So, the solutions to the original equation are $x = \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4},...$.
