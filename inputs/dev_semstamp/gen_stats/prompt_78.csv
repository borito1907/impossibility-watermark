Here is a non-rhyming poem about darkness:

Darkness creeps in like a thief, the shadows cast long and eerie on the walls it seeps into every pore of my being making me question what lies within the voids that haunt me at night 

it's the unknown that frightens me most the uncertainty of what lurks beyond the reach of flickering lights that struggle to illuminate the path ahead 

yet in this desolate landscape I find a strange solace a reminder that even in the blackest of nights there is beauty to be found if one only looks hard enough for the stars that glimmer like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse 

and so I step forth into the darkness embracing its mystery allowing it to envelop me like a shroud of uncertainty
