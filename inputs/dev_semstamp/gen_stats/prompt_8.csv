63,"According to a wildlife expert the average weight of soil moved by a woodchuck in a day is around 35 cubic feet.

",False,,,,3
64,"Assuming a woodchuck could indeed chuck wood with the same efficiency as they burrow soil let's make an educated guess:

* A typical adult woodchuck weighs around 5-10 pounds (2.3-4.5 kg) and is approximately 20-27 inches (51-69 cm) long including their tail.
",False,,,,4

83,"Using these numbers we can make a rough estimate:

35 cubic feet (soil) / day ÷ 128 cubic feet (1 cord of wood) ≈ 0.275 cords of wood per day
