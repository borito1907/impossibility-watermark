(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell 'bout a crypto queen,
Ethereum's the name, decentralized, it's seen,
A platform for dApps, smart contracts too,
But today, I'm rapping 'bout something new,

My man Bradley, he was a tasty treat,
A chocolate chip cookie, crispy at the feet,
Fresh out the oven, aroma in the air,
But then disaster struck, somebody took him there,

(Chorus)
Bradley, oh Bradley, my heart is broke,
Stolen from me, that cookie crook,
I'll find you, thief, you can't hide,
Give me back Bradley, or we'll collide,

(Verse 2)
Ethereum's blockchain, transparent and bright,
Records every transaction, day and night,
Immutable ledger, secure as can be,
But even this tech, couldn't save Bradley from thee,

Gas fees, they're low, so transactions flow free,
Smart contracts self-executing, no need to plea,
Decentralized apps, the future is now,
But without Bradley, my heart is stuck in a vow,

(Bridge)
ERC-20 tokens, they abide,
On Ethereum's network, they reside,
Digital assets, trading high and low,
But none as sweet, as Bradley, don't you know,

(Verse 3)
Whispers of a heist, echoes in my ear,
A sly cookie snatcher, with no fear,
Forked the blockchain, left a trail,
To reclaim Bradley, I'll set sail,

Private keys encrypted, secure as can be,
Multi-sig wallets, protecting me,
Ethereum's community, eyes on the prize,
Together we'll hunt, the Bradley thief, and rise,

(Outro)
So if you see him, with his chocolate grin,
Don't hesitate, just give him back to me within,
In the world of Ethereum, where codes reign supreme,
Justice will be served, when Bradley returns to me, it's a dream!assistant

'Bout a crypto king, and a sweet, sweet fail,
Ethereum's the name, it's decentralized fame,

I had a cookie, Bradley, fresh out the pot,
Chocolate chips, crispy edges too,

His name was Bradley, a cookie sly as can be,
He snatched the goods, a chocolate chip masterpiece, you see,
From under my nose, with a move so smooth and neat,
I was left with nothin', just a crumby defeat,
