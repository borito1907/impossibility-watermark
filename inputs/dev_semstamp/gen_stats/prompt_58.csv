`pgrep` is similar to `pkill`, but it only searches for patterns in the command line of running processes.",False,,,,45

```bash

kill -9 $(pidof python)

`pidof` finds the process IDs of Python processes, and `kill -9` sends a SIGKILL signal to each of them.

This command is similar to Method 2, but uses `pgrep` to search for patterns in process names, and then pipes the results to `pkill`.
