Here's a simple CSS script that sets the background color of a page to a nice shade of blue and adds some basic styling to headings:
```csssss (just kidding, ( sort of ))
```
Here's the actual script:

```css

/* Set the background color of the body */
body {
  background-color: #87CEEB;
}

/* Style h1 headings */
h1 {
  font-size: 36px;
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style p tags */
p {
  font-size: 18px;
  color: #555;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```
