Here is a poem that doesn't rely on traditional rhymes:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at night 
a heavy stillness that mutes the sounds of humanity's hustle and bustle 

The stars twinkle above like diamonds scattered across velvet 
their gentle sparkle a reminder of the infinite mysteries that lie beyond our small terrestrial concerns 

In this moment I am suspended between the vast expanse of the universe 
and the intimate whispers of my own heartbeat 

Time stretches out before me like an endless desert highway 
each step forward a choice to be made, it seems 

And yet in the stillness I find a sense of peace 
a fragile equilibrium that balances the conflicting desires of my restless soul

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
A stillness that seeps into every pore 
The trees stand tall and unmoving

 Memories linger on the edge of consciousness 
 Fragments of joy and sorrow and longing 
Echoes of love and loss and laughter

 Untethered from the anxieties of tomorrow

On the sleeping city's face 

A fragile beauty born of shadows 

Ephemeral as the night itself

Silence creeps over me like a fog

Echoes of laughter whispers of goodbyes

A whisper in the darkness that will guide me through 
A way to express the turmoil that rages within 
To give form to the emotions that threaten to consume me

Leaving me to wander lost in this wilderness of thought 
 Searching for a sound a cry a scream a word.assistant

Here is a poem that doesn't use rhyming:

Silence falls like a soft blanket 
Gentle and comforting 
A stillness that seeps into my bones 
And quiets the whispers of my mind 

The world outside recedes into the distance 
Fading to a murmur 
As I stand at the edge of myself 
Lost in the expanse of my own soul 

 Memories stir like leaves rustling 
Unmoored from their anchors 
Drifting on currents of time 
Ephemeral as the morning dew 

In this quiet I find solace 
A sense of self restored 
A fragile peace that gathers strength 
Like the slow unfolding of a flowerassistant

Here's a poem that doesn't rely on traditional rhymes:

Silence falls like a soft blanket over the city at dawn 
The darkness is almost palpable, for a moment before the sun rises 
Birds start to stir in the trees their gentle chirping a soothing hum 
As the light creeps slowly over the rooftops the world begins to wake 

Memories of last night's dreams still linger on my skin 
Fleeting glimpses of emotions felt but not fully understood 
The morning light is unforgiving it exposes all our flaws 
Yet somehow it also brings a sense of possibility and renewal 

Perhaps today will be different perhaps today will be the day 
I find the courage to speak my mind to let my true self shine through 
Or maybe today will be just another day of getting by 
Either way the morning has arrived and anything seems possibleassistant

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
A stillness that seeps into every pore 
The stars above twinkle like diamonds scattered 
Across the velvet expanse of night 

 Memories linger in the corners of my mind 
Echoes of laughter whispers of forgotten dreams 
Shadows dance upon the walls as moonlight creeps 
Into the hidden places of my heart

A sense of calm that soothes my weary soul 
The world may rage and storm outside these walls

 Memories swirl like autumn leaves in the wind 
Fleeting glimpses of joy and sorrow and everything in between 
Emotions ebb and flow like the tides of some great ocean 
I am lost in the depths of my own heart 

In this moment time stands still 
The universe holds its breath as I ponder the mysteries 
Of existence of love of life 
And the meaning that lies just beyond my graspassistant

Silence falls like mist on the city

Grey concrete buildings rise from the earth like giants

Their peaks hidden in cloud and fog

The sound of rain whispers secrets to the pavement

Memories of summers past linger in forgotten corners

Forgotten scents and half-remembered melodies

Echoes of love and loss that refuse to fade

In the midst of chaos, (find) moments of stillness 

A breath of calm before the storm breaks

The beauty lies not in the noise but in the spaces between

In the quiet where words are unnecessary.

Silence falls like a mist on the city 
A quiet so thick you can feel it settling 
In the crevices of buildings and souls 

Memories seep from the cracks in the pavement 
Like whispers from another time 
Echoes of laughter and tears 

The sky above is a deep shade of indigo 
A canvas stretched taut with the promise of dawn 
Stars hidden like diamonds in the velvet 

In this moment everything feels possible 
The world holds its breath in anticipation 
Of what will unfold when morning breaksassistant

Whispers of forgotten conversations 
Half-remembered dreams that refuse to fade 

Time stretches out like a canvas 
Blank and waiting for brushstrokes

Reflecting the beauty of the world

A stillness that calms the mind 
A chance to let go of the burdens 
And simply be
