Here's a non-rhyming poem I came up with:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
A soft layer of stillness that wraps around every building 
Every sound is muffled,uuu 

 Memories linger in the air like wisps of smoke 
Fragments of moments lived and loved and lost 
Echoes of laughter and tears 

In this quiet space I find myself 
A small but vital part of something greater 
Connected to all that has been and all that will be 
Yet suspended in this fleeting moment 

The world outside recedes and I am left alone 
With only my thoughts for company 
But even they are hushed 
As if afraid to break the spell of silence 

Let me bask in this stillness awhile 
Let it fill me and calm me and soothe me 
For in its depths I may just find what I've been searching forassistant

I hope you enjoyed the poem!",False,,,,1

Silence falls like a velvet shroud 
draping the city in an eerie stillness 

The stars above, twinkling diamonds scattered across the canvas of night 
a celestial showcase of beauty and wonder 

In this moment, A sense of peace settles 
like the gentle lapping of waves against the shores of my soul 

Time stands still as I breathe in deeply 
the world's chaos momentarily forgotten 

In this fleeting instant 
I am free to simply beassistant

I'm glad you asked me to create a non-rhyming poem for you!",True,1,"7,2",True,2

Silence falls like a veil 
Across the landscape of my mind 
A stillness that is both calm and cold 
Where thoughts and emotions are left behind 

In this quiet, 
I search for answers to questions I've yet to ask 
For clues to unravel the tangled threads of my past 
And glimpse the shadows of what's yet to come 

The world outside recedes from view 
As I delve deeper into the labyrinth of my soul 
Where darkness gathers like a mist 
And the only sound is the echo of my heartbeat 

In this solitude 
I find fragments of myself 
 Pieces of a puzzle that refuses to be whole 
A work in progress 
A story still being writtenassistant

I hope you enjoy this non-rhyming poem!",True,5,"7,2",True,3

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a veil of mist 
Gently shrouding the city's din and noise 
A quiet hush that seeps into every pore 
As the world slows its frantic pace 

In this stillness, thoughts begin to unfurl 
Like tendrils of a vine that's long been dormant 
Memories resurface, (some painful some sweet) 
As the fog of distraction clears 

In these rare moments of quiet contemplation 
I am left alone with my own heartbeats 
The thrum of life echoes through every cell 
Reminding me I am alive 

Let the silence hold me for just a little while longer 
Let it soothe my weary soul 
For in its depths I find a fleeting sense of peace 
A fragile solace that makes me wholeassistant
