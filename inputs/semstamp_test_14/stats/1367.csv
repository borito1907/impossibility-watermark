Silence falls like a soft mist 
enveloping the city in its gentle grasp 
the sounds of humanity muffled and distant 
as if heard through a thick veil 

In this quiet world time stands still 
no clock ticks no bird sings 
only the beat of my heart echoes through the emptiness 
a reminder that I am alive 

The darkness presses in around me 
a physical presence that cannot be ignored 
it seeps into my bones chilling me to the marrow 
leaving me feeling fragile and vulnerable 

And yet in this bleakness I find solace 
a strange sense of comfort in the desolation 
perhaps it's the freedom from expectation 
or the simplicity of being alone 

Whatever the reason it's enough for now 
to let the silence wash over me 
and carry away my doubts and fears on its gentle tide.assistant

where worries and fears are left behind 
and all that's left is the gentle hum of existence 

It's here that I find my true self 
unencumbered by expectations and doubts 
free to explore the depths of my own heart 
and discover the beauty that lies within 

Let the silence wash over me 
like a cool breeze on a summer's day 
bringing peace and clarity to my spirit 
and guiding me on my journey through life.assistant

I hope you enjoyed the poem!",True,1,"7,2",True,49
50,"

Silence falls like a veil of mist 
A quiet so profound it's almost palpable 

In this stillness, I search for answers 
For the meaning that lies hidden beneath 
The surface of my restless mind 

The world outside recedes into the distance 
As I delve deeper into the labyrinth of myself 
I am lost in the corridors of thought 
Where shadows dance and whispers unfold 

In this suspended moment, time stands still 
As I confront the fragments of my soul 
The shards of dreams and broken promises 
The echoes of footsteps that have long since faded 

And yet, I find solace in this emptiness 
A strange comfort in the desolate landscape 
For here I am free to roam unencumbered 
To chart the cartography of my own heartassistant
