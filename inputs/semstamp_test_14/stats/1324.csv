A group of ratty pupils, ( quite renowned ),
Their teacher, of tunnels and cheese so fine,
Professor Scurry,.

Mastered fractions in a single wave,
He'd calculate pi to five decimal places neat,
And his whiskers would quiver with glee at the feat.

In maze-like labs, where science reigns,
Rats calculated routes for sweetest gains.
