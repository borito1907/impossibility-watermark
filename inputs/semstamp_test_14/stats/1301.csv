Softly wrapping the world in stillness 
The stars shine bright in the dark sky 
A canopy of light in the void

The world's din and chaos momentarily stilled

Silence falls like a blanket 
over the city at dawn 
the streets empty and still 
except for the distant hum 

of a lonely engine roaring 
to life in the distance 
a solitary figure emerges 
from the shadows to claim 

the new day with hesitant steps 
as morning light slowly creeps 
across the concrete landscape 
and the world slowly awakes
