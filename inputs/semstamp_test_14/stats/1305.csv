Silence falls like a soft mist 
Gently enveloping the world 
In its quiet, is solace found 
A refuge from life's chaotic din 

The stillness seeps into my pores 
Calming the turbulence within

As the world's frenzy slowly spins 

In this hush, I find my center 
A sense of balance restored 
The noise and chaos recede 
Leaving only serenity

Settle upon me like a cloak 
Wrapping me in calm embrace

As I breathe in deeply the calm that surrounds me 

Yet even as I stand here suspended in this moment 
I know it will not last forever 
The noise and chaos will return with a vengeance 
And I will be left to confront once more the turmoil within 

But for now I'll savor this brief respite 
This temporary solace from the storm that rages on 
For in its quiet depths I may just find the strength 
To face whatever tomorrow brings.assistant

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a soft blanket 
over the city at dawn 
The stars have faded, 
and the world is full of possibility 

 Memories linger 
like the scent of old books 
forgotten moments 
echoes of love and loss 

In the stillness I find myself 
searching for answers 
in the quiet darkness 
I begin to understand 

Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes or if you have any other requests!assistant

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a soft blanket over the city at night 
A calm that seeps into the pores of every living thing 
The stars twinkle like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse 
As the world exhales its worries and troubles with a gentle sigh 

In this stillness I find myself lost in thought 
Reflections of days gone by swirl like autumn leaves in the breeze 
 Memories both sweet and bitter mingle on my tongue 
Leaving me to ponder the paths not taken and the roads yet to be traveled 

Yet even as the darkness closes in 
I sense the pulse of life beneath my feet 
A reminder that each new dawn brings chance anew 
To rewrite the story of who I am and what I'll become.assistant

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a soft blanket over the city at dawn 
A time of quiet contemplation before the chaos begins 
The stars still twinkle in the sky like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse 
As the world slowly stirs from its slumber 

 Memories linger on the edge of consciousness 
Fragments of dreams that refuse to fade 
The morning light creeps over the horizon 
A gentle awakening from the darkness 

In this moment, and only this moment 
All is right with the world 
The universe is full of possibilities 
And anything can happenassistant

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a blanket of snow 
 Softly covering the city's noise and chaos 
A stillness that seeps into every pore 
Cleansing the mind and calming the heart 

In this quiet, not a single sound 
Can be heard for miles around 
No whispers no murmurs no sighs 
Just the gentle hum of silence 

It wraps itself around me 
A comforting shroud that soothes my soul 
In its emptiness I find peace 
A sense of freedom from life's turmoil 

Let me bask in this silent hush 
For in its depths I find my true selfassistant
