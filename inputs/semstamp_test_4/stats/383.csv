Destination unknown/ Where the hell we bound?

Verse 1:
Gasoline and guts, our engines roar to life 
Creature feature in the rearview, we're on the rise 
Werewolf at the wheel/ Frankenstein by my side 
Mummy map-reader/ Vampire navigator ride 

Chorus:
Monsters on the move/ Highway hellride crew 
Fiendish freaks on four wheels/ We're coming through 
Blood and bolts and bone 
We'll drive all night/ Leave the dawn alone 

Verse 2:
Zombie zones and ghost towns pass us by 
Cthulhu's cadaverous hand gives us the high sign 
The Mothman winks from roadside billboards bright 
Gillman grins and waves goodbye to morning light 

Chorus:
Monsters on the move/ Highway hellride crew 
Fiendish freaks on four wheels/ We're coming through 
Blood and bolts and bone 
We'll drive all night/ Leave the dawn alone 

Bridge:
Truck stop terror in our wake 
A midnight snack of fear and flames 
Nocturnal nomads,'the asphalt our stage 
Roadkill and chaos in our dusty age 

Chorus:
Monsters on the move/ Highway hellride crew 
Fiendish freaks on four wheels/ We're coming through 
Blood and bolts and bone 
We'll drive all night/ Leave the dawn alone 

Outro:
Headlights pierce the darkness like a scream 
Rusting hulks of cars/ Our victims left to gleam 
Fuel injectors pumpin' monster hearts 
No speed limit for the damned and departed parts.

**Verse 1**
We're a crew of creatures, misfit and bold 
Packed in a van, of rust and old 
From Transylvania to Tijuana we roam 
A monster mashup, driving all night, home 

**Chorus**
Fuel for the beast, a never-ending ride 
Through hellish highways, where the damned reside 
Screams in the darkness, laughter in the light 
Monsters on the move, burning through the night 

**Verse 2**
Frankenstein's behind the wheel, lurching left and right 
Werewolf's got the GPS, navigating through the fight 
Mummy's got the snacks, wrapped up tight 
And Dracula's riding shotgun, with an eternal bite

Fuel for the beast, a never-ending ride 
Through hellish highways, where the damned reside 
Screams in the darkness, laughter in the light 
Monsters on the move, burning through the night

Where mortals dare not tread, we'll gladly invade 
No speed limit for us, no boundary too far 
We're monsters on the loose, leaving hell to scar

Through hellish highways, where the damned reside 
Screams in the darkness, laughter in the light

Our trail of terror, forever in their sight 
As we disappear, into the dark of night 
The next town's waiting, our next bloody feast 
Monsters on the move, we'll never find rest.
