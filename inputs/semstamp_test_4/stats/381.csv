on mountaintops 
where condors soar 
the people once believed 
in a terrible bargain 

exchanged for life-giving rain 
their children's innocent eyes 
closed forever 
in frozen grasp 

of Apu mountain gods 
who demanded more 
with each passing season 
a fresh crop of tiny hearts 

beaten with fear 
by those who should protect 
the soft whispers of ""mama"" 
drowned out by screams 

in the name of fertility 
they gave up their most precious 
bundles of joy 
left to suffocate 
in the thin Andean air 

for the promise of wet skies 
and green fields awash 
with the blood of innocence 
pooled at their feet

to the altar of appeasement

what was most precious

echoes through the hills 
as mothers surrender 
their most tender wills

haunt like a lingering shiver

crushed their tender bones
