**Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]
In the hollow of my chest,bone lies a weight that cannot sleep 
A darkness born of every fear, every shadow that I keep 
It stirs and whispers, 'rise' 
A force that gnaws beneath the surface, tearing through the seams

The ghosts of silence gather 'round 
Their whispers weaving into sound 
I feel the echoes resound 
As the void awakens from its wound

Fractured dreams and midnight skies 
Reflect the turmoil in my eyes 
Every heartbeat's a drumbeat loud 
Pounding out the rhythm of my doubt 
Will I ever find the truth I've lost?

In twilight's hollow, Where shadows writhe and twist 
I'll find my way through The mirrored maze within 
Echoes of forgotten names Whisper secrets in my ear

A call to arms, a desperate dream 
As darkness gathers, it reveals 
The ghosts that I've concealed

Frayed edges of a broken frame 
Vessels cracked, spilling their worth 
A tapestry of fractured birth 
Flickering lights in dying eyes 
Reflections of a life denied

A spark remains, flickering still, on this darkest night 

Chorus:
Rise from the embers, risen anew 
Unshackle chains of reason,'t let logic subdue 
The primal force that drives me forth, untamed and bold 
To break free from mortal bonds, to reclaim what's been sold

Visions of liberation etched upon the walls of time 
Beneath the surface, a cauldron bubbles over 
As I tap into the fury that has long been smothered

Confronting demons born from love, loss, and all the shame 
Where every scar tells stories of trials past and worn 
Yet, here lies strength within, forged like tempered dawn

Unshackle chains of reason, don't let logic subdue 
The primal force that drives me forth, untamed and bold

Emancipation calls, through heartbeats, loud and plain 
From darkness to rebirth, I take my final stand 
Awakened soul ablaze, unbound at last.

**Verse 1**
In the hollow of my chest, a fire festers deep 
Where shadows writhe and whisper secrets I'd rather not keep 
A labyrinthine heart beats strong, a maze I've yet to map 
Terra incognita, where darkness holds its endless lap 

**Chorus**
I am lost in the undertow, of my own making 
Drowning slow, as the weight of my demons keeps on breaking 
Beneath the surface, I'm screaming, but nobody can hear 
Trapped in this abyss, forever falling, disappearing from fear 

**Verse 2**
Mirrored reflections stare back, a masquerade of deceit 
Fractured souls conjoined in silence, an unholy matrimony of defeat 
Each shard of shattered glass reflects the shards within my mind 
Echoes of what could've been, now mere ghosts left behind 

**Chorus**
I am lost in the undertow, of my own making 
Drowning slow, as the weight of my demons keeps on breaking 
Beneath the surface I'm screaming, but nobody can hear 
Trapped in this abyss, forever falling, disappearing from fear

A heart of stone, yet still it bleeds 
In this darkest sea, I'm searching for a shore 
Where the light of love will heal these scars once more

The ghosts of loved ones past, they whisper low 
Their memories, a curse, a haunting glow 
Regrets like autumn leaves, they swirl and fall

A heart of stone, yet still it bleeds 
In this darkest sea, I'm searching for a shore 
Where the light of love will heal these scars once more

Free from the chains of pain, release 
But until then, I'll wander, lost and alone 
Through the ruins of my heart, where love has turned to stone

Fading embers of love that dwindled into grey

This endless maze we weave, our fears, our tears 
Shackles on the soul, a prison of despair 
Yet still we search for light within the suffocating air

As darkness closes in, the silence is to blame 
Can't escape this labyrinth, where shadows hold their sway

Following paths where ancients once did reside 
Forgotten knowledge whispered in my ear 
Ancient mysteries unfold, as secrets start to clear

**Lyrics:**

[Intro]
In darkness, the veil is thinning now 
The echoes call, the faithful to bow 
To silence, where shadows crawl 
And whispers pierce the hollow halls 

[Verse 1] 
Through eyes of old, the secrets seep 
A tale of bloodlines steeped in deceit 
Where ghosts of pasts awaken deep 
And ancient wounds begin to creep 

[Chorus] 
Oh, we're lost in this labyrinthine mind 
Forever trapped, forever blind 
Hollow voices whisper our names 
As the void consumes us, shrouded in flames 

[Verse 2] 
Fractured dreams, shards of sanity shattered 
Whispers breed despair, in midnight air that's scattered 
A maze of mirrors, reflections torn apart 
Echoes scream where broken hearts reside 

[Chorus]  
Oh, we're lost in this labyrinthine mind 
Forever trapped, forever blind 
Hollow voices whisper our names 
As the void consumes us, shrouded in flames 

[Bridge]  
Shadows writhe like vines around my soul 
Visions crumbling as the fire grows cold 
I search the dark, a beacon's light 
For escape from these endless nightmarish plights 

[Chorus]  
Oh, we're lost in this labyrinthine mind  
Forever trapped, forever blind  
Hollow voices whisper our names 
As the void consumes us, shrouded in flames 

[Outro]  
So in the silence, let the truth be told 
That in the shadows, our hearts will grow old 
In darkness, we'll find our final rest 
Embracing the void, eternal unrest.

""Echoes in the Hollow""

Verse 1:
In the silence, a whisper grows 
A haunting cadence that only I know 
The trees they seem to lean in close 
As if to share a secret no one knows 

Pre-Chorus:
And I am searching for a truth 
In the shadows where the darkness roots 
A mystery that beckons me 
To unravel threads of destiny 

Chorus:
Oh, echoes in the hollow 
Whispers of a forgotten past 
Guiding me through labyrinths old 
Where ancient voices forever last 

Verse 2:
A language hidden in the wind 
Ancient tongues that only mystics find 
Ciphers etched upon the stone 
Cryptic messages that only I have known 

Pre-Chorus:
And I am chasing shadows cast 
Into the void where darkness is amassed 
A siren's call that whispers low 
Of secrets hidden long ago 

Chorus:
Oh, echoes in the hollow 
Whispers of a forgotten past 
Guiding me through labyrinths old 
Where ancient voices forever last 

Bridge:
In dreams, I see the city old 
A place where myth and legend unfold 
In crumbling spires, I hear the call 
To unearth the mysteries that enthrall 

Chorus:
Oh, echoes in the hollow 
Whispers of a forgotten past 
Guiding me through labyrinths old 
Where ancient voices forever last

I'll follow paths that few may know 
Through shadowed gates, I'll make my way 
To hear the secrets of the hollow say.
