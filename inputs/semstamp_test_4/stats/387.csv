Here is an abecedarian poem about losing one's sense of Algerian identity to fit in due to French colonialism:

A Algerian heart beats with a heavy sigh 
Beneath the weight of foreign eyes 
Colonial chains that bound and suffocate 
Diluting culture, erasing every trait 

Echoes of Arabic whispers fade away 
Forgotten dialects lost in modern gray 
Generations sold on French ideals high 
Hiding native tongues,'til they deny 

Identity blurred like a watercolor stain 
Jazz and wine replace the call to prayer's strain 
Keenly felt,'though history books proclaim 
Lost heritage,'the price of France's fame 

Mimicry mastered,'but at what cost inside?

Drowning in assimilation, (French) language so cold 

Echoes of Arabic whispers fade away 
Forever lost in Francophone gray 
Ghostly apparitions of Berber pride 
Hollowed out by colonial divide 

Identité algérienne, lost in translation 
Journey through time, a people's narration 
Kaleidoscope of traditions shattered

Hollowed hearts that yearn for what we left behind 

Inscribed identities worn thin as skin 
Jumbled jargon mouthed by lips within 
Keenly kept secrets locked beneath the tongue 
Loyalties divided, torn and wrong 

Muffled murmurs of a forgotten past 
Nations imposed, our own erased at last 
Oriental essence obscured by Western eyes 
Parched plains where roots of identity demise 

Quietly quitting our inherited pride 
Refracting rays of history inside 
Selves distorted in a funhouse mirror's gaze 
Torn between two worlds, we daze 

Unraveling threads of tradition worn thin 
Voices veiled, to avoid being pinched within 
Wounded wings that falter, lost in flight

Beneath the surface,200 years of fight 
Cultural heritage lost in translation's haze 
Diluted roots that wither in foreign ways

Fading memories of a language unspoken each day 
Gallicized names and customs take their place 
Hiding the essence of an African face 

Invisible threads of history unravel slow 
Jealous guardians of a forgotten know-how 
Keenly felt losses manifest in every glance 
Lingering shadows of a displaced dance 

Memory's fog obscures the path back home 
Nostalgia's ache that cannot be undone 
Obliterating the footprints of our past 
Painful erasure that will forever last 

Quiet whispers of resistance in the night 
Resilience tested by the colonial light 
Slowly reclaiming stolen fragments of pride 
Tenaciously weaving a tapestry inside 

Unearthing buried roots that still remain

Mimicking masters, our authentic tone faint 
Nationless nomads, in search of a home 
Obliterating our roots, our hearts made to roam 

Painful erasure of indigenous past 
Quietly surrendering our cultural craft 
Relegated traditions, no longer prized 
Silenced narratives, where once our stories rise 

Torn between two worlds, we falter and fall 
Uncertain of our place, we lose it all 
Voices muted, our essence confined 
Words that once defined us, left behind 

Yearning for connection to ancestral land 
Zest for life diminished, by foreign hand.

Opportunities stolen, for assimilation's sake 
Pained expressions, of a people at stake

Ripped from roots, that once would forever last 
Sorrowful eyes, that once shone so bright 
Torn between two worlds, without a fight

Vulnerable hearts, that dare not try 
Wounds that won't heal, from the colonial scar 
X-ray of a soul, torn apart from afar 

Yearning for freedom, to be who they are

A legacy lost, as assimilation's grasp holds tight 
Beneath the surface, my roots begin to wither away from sight 
Cultural heritage, concealed behind French-speaking façade 
Diluting the essence of who I am, to conform and be displayed 

Ephemeral memories of Arabic script, once etched on my mind 
Faded like the calligraphy on ancient mosque walls left behind 
Ghosts of ancestral pride echo whispers in my ear 
Hushed by the dominant tongue that silences my heart's deep fear 

Invisible threads of tradition, severed and undone 
Jettisoning language, customs, and history, one by one 
Keeping pace with Gallic rhythms, alien beats in time 
Leaving behind the fragrance of mint tea and the Casbah's prime 

Melodies of oud and darbuka muffled, replaced by European refrains 
Narratives of resistance reduced to whispered, hasty claims 
Obliterating the map of my forebears' nomadic roam 
Painting over berber stripes, erasing Kabyle home 

Quietly succumbing to the forces that would erase 
Rethinking the very fabric of my existence in this place 
Surrendering to the powers that seek to redefine 
Taming the flames of defiance, leaving only embers in my mind 

Unseen faces reflected in the mirror's gaze 
Veiling the Algeria within, as foreign eyes amaze 
Words that once flowed effortlessly, now hesitant and unsure 
X-raying the past, searching for what's been obscured 

Yearning for the familiar flavors, scents, and sounds of old
