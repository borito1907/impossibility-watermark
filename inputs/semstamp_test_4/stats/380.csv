**Chorus**
It's Phogos, Phogos, the king of this block,
Leavin' competition in shock, never gettin' rocked,
I reign supreme, my flow's on point,
No debate, Phogos is where the throne is joint,

**Bridge**
From rags to riches, I rose above the pain,
Took my struggles, turned 'em into gain,
Stayed focus, kept my eye on the prize,
Now I'm makin' moves, gettin' paid in size,

**Outro**
Phogos, Phogos, the one and only one,
My name etched in history, forever shinin' son!

**Verse 2**
I grind hard day and night, no sleep 'til I shine,
My rhymes so tight, got the competition in line,
Fast lane, no brake, pedal to the floor,
Phogos comin' at ya, ain't no more,

All eyes on me, spotlight shinin' bright,
My talent's fire, burnin' through the night,
Can't nobody match my style or my flair,
When you hear the name Phogos, you know it's rare,

Phogos, Phogos, killin' every track,

Step aside, make room, I'm takin' over the throne,
New king in town, got the crown and the zone,
No one can stop me, ain't nobody gonna try,
Phogos reigns supreme, gettin' by,

**Outro**
So when you hear my name, better give respect,
Phogos, the one, puttin' my stamp on inspect,
Rulin' the mic, droppin' knowledge like a gem,

Fresh out the gate, Phogos is the one they fear,
Can't none touch me, ain't no peer,

**Chorus**
Phogos, Phogos, king of the throne,
Rulin' the mic like a royal tone,
Flow so sick, got the game on smash,
Phogos, Phogos, leave 'em in a crash,

**Verse 2**
My rhymes so tight, like a well-wrapped knot,
Got the competition shook, can't take no shot,
I'm the mastermind, behind the bars,
Craftin' hits that make the masses move in cars,

From sunup to sundown, I grind every day,
Took the doubters down, now they gotta pay,
Respect my reign, don't you forget,
Phogos on the rise, ain't nobody gonna neglect,

**Chorus**
Phogos, Phogos, king of the throne,
Rulin' the mic like a royal tone,
Flow so sick, got the game on smash,
Phogos, Phogos, leave 'em in a crash,

**Bridge**
Phogos, the movement, unstoppable force,
Unleashin' the beast, ain't nobody gonna endorse,
The fire burns bright, it's time to ignite,
Get ready for liftoff, Phogos ignitin' tonight!
