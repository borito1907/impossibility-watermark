A poison that spreads, an eternal sleep

Oh, I'm tethered to your pain 
A masochist's devotion, an endless refrain 
Through hellfire and despair, I'll follow you there 
Forever entwined, our love will forever impair 

Bridge:
Our twisted hearts, beating as one 
In perfect harmony, the chaos has begun 
Two broken wings, entangled in flight 
Together, we'll crash, into the dark of night 

Chorus:
Oh, I'm tethered to your pain 
A masochist's devotion, an endless refrain 
Through hellfire and despair, I'll follow you there 
Forever entwined, our love will forever impair 

Outro:
Now our love's a noose that's tightening fast 
Asphyxiating life, out of our shattered past 
Yet, in this suffocating grasp 
Lies a love so fierce, it will forever last.

**Title:** ""Bound in Blood and Flame""

**Lyrics:**

Verse 1:
Infernal whispers, echoes in my mind 
Your name etched on my skin, to forever remain 
Crimson kisses leave their mark like scars that won't subside 
Our twisted bond now forged in darkness inside 

Chorus:
I'm lost in your abyss, entwined with every thread 
Forever bound in blood and flame, our hearts now wed 
The fires burning bright within, in endless night 
With you, I'll take the fall, embracing this eternal fight 

Verse 2:
Tattered threads of sanity unravel, consumed by desire 
In each other's arms, we're damned, yet set on fire 
Ephemeral moments stolen, fleeting taste of sin 
Together, we defy the light, in shadows locked within 

Chorus:
I'm lost in your abyss, entwined with every thread 
Forever bound in blood and flame, our hearts now wed 
The fires burning bright within, in endless night 
With you, I'll take the fall, embracing this eternal fight 

Bridge:
In chaos lies our solace, where madness is our guide 
Hand in hand, into the void, no return from the slide 
No escape, just surrender, we'll burn together whole 
Enshrining our forever, sealed in this demonic hold 

Chorus:
I'm lost in your abyss, entwined with every thread 
Forever bound in blood and flame, our hearts now wed 
The fires burning bright within, in endless night 
With you, I'll take the fall, embracing this eternal fight
