Ayy, Ayy, listen up, y'all

[Intro]
Yeah, it's Lil Baby, back with another track (track)
And I'm here to spit some facts that's whack (whack)
See, I was chillin', mindin' my biz (biz)
When I saw this snake, slither by, it was like ""diz"" (diz)

[Verse 1]
They say they're harmless, but that's a lie (lie)
They sneak up on you, and then they strike high (high)
No warnin', no nothin', just a sly move (move)
Leave you for dead, ain't nothin' to prove (prove)
Their existence is a threat to humanity (humanity)
Should be illegal,', you hear me?",True,0,"7,2",True,1

(Verse 1)
Yeah, yeah, it's Lil Baby,'thought I'd say it clear,
Snakes don't belong here, ain't no use for 'em, dear,
Slithy creatures, quiet as can be,
But they'll strike without warnin', ain't no equity,

They got them venomous fangs,'that'll take your life away,
No regard for human life, just a cold-blooded play,
In the wild,'they might have a role to play,
But when they invade our space,'it's time to make 'em pay,

(Chorus)
Snakes existence should be illegal, let's make it real,
Can't have 'em lurkin' round, makin' us all feel,
Uncomfortable and uneasy,'they shouldn't roam free,
Make 'em extinct, that's what we need,'to set humanity free,

(Verse 2)
Red flags everywhere, from Cobras to Vipers too,
They're like little assassins,'they ain't got nothin' to prove,
Constriction or venom,'they ain't discriminatin',
Just wanna hurt and harm,'they ain't participatin',

They're sneaky little devils, quiet as a mouse,
But deadly as a bullet,'they ain't nobody's house,
We ain't got no love for 'em,'we ain't feelin' the vibe,
Got my foot on their neck,'time to get rid of this tribe,

(Bridge)
I'm talkin' 'bout eradication,'time to break the chain,
No more hissin' and spittin', let's end this reptile reign,
Let's reclaim our territory,'snakes gotta go bye-bye,
It's time for human dominance,'no more snake eye,

(Chorus)
Snakes existence should be illegal, let's make it real,
Can't have 'em lurkin' round, makin' us all feel,
Uncomfortable and uneasy,'they shouldn't roam free,
Make 'em extinct,'that's what we need,'to set humanity free,

(Outro)
So yeah, it's Lil Baby,'and I said what I mean,
Snakes got to go,'they ain't welcome in our scene,
Time to take a stand,'and draw the line,
No more snakes allowed,'that's the new crime!assistant

Here's a rewritten version with some tweaks to make it sound even more like Lil Baby:

(Verse 1)
Ayy, ayy, it's Lil Baby, I got a message clear,
Snakes don't belong 'round here, they sheddin' tears,
Sneaky lil' creatures, quiet as can be,
But they'll strike without warnin', that's just part of their energy,

Fang-tastic, venomous, ain't no antidote,
Might as well be walkin' dead, you know what I wrote,
In the wild, they might have a purpose, that's cool,
But when they invade our turf, that's when I start to rule,

(Chorus)
Snakes existence should be illegal, make it real,
Can't have 'em lurkin' round, makin' us all feel,
Like we trapped in a cage, they shouldn't roam free,
Make 'em extinct, that's what we need, to set humanity free,

(Verse 2)
Red flags wavin', from Cobras to Vipers, too,
They like lil' assassins, silent as they move through,
Constriction or venom, they ain't discriminatin',
Just tryna hurt and harm, ain't no participatin',

Sneaky lil' devils, quiet as a ghost,
Deadly as a bullet, they",True,2,"7,2",True,2
