With every step further away from her tribe's familiar sights and sounds, (the gentle chirping of macaws, warm sun on her skin) Andromeda felt the rush of freedom coursing within- Her calloused feet pounded against foreign earth- Paved roads replaced the dirt trails she knew so well- Towering structures that touched the sky loomed above her like giants, the cacophony of unfamiliar noises assaulted her senses- Yet she pressed onward undeterred by the strange surroundings-

After many moons and countless leagues traversed- Andromeda finally reached the bustling metropolis where she hoped to find the legendary She-Hulk- It was said that she roamed these concrete jungles- Ever vigilant and ready to defend those who could not protect themselves- Andromeda followed whispers and rumors leading her deeper into the city's labyrinthine streets until at last she came upon a towering figure in ripped jeans and a faded purple shirt-
