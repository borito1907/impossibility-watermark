Thought you could take me down with your insurance claim to shame,
But I'm a global superstar, ain't nobody gonna tame,
My rhymes so tight, they're like a perfectly priced policy,'thame.

**Verse 1 - Taylor Swift**
Yo, Gio Compario, I heard you've been talking smack 
About my songwriting skills, and my country-pop attack 
Newsflash: I'm a legend in the game, got Grammys to my name 
You're just a goofy dude with an opera claim to fame 

My rhymes are fire,'t, yours are just a bore 
I sell out stadiums,'t, you get ignored 
My fans are Swifties, die-hard and true 
Yours are probably just confused, what insurance to choose 

**Verse 2 - GoCompare Man**
Taylor, sweetheart, you may have the fame 
But when it comes to saving cash, I'm the one with the aim 
I compare prices, find the best deals too 
You just sing about love, boo-hoo, while I save people dough, boo-yah!

Yo, GioCompario, you're in my sights,
Think you can take me down with your opera might?

**Taylor Swift**

Yo, I'm T-Swift, it's my stage, (get used to the fame)
Got more platinum records than you've got claims to fame 
I sell out stadiums while you're stuck in a booth 
My rhymes are tighter than your quotes on auto-renew 

You may have a catchy jingle but that's where it ends 
My songs tell stories of heartbreak,'til my haters trend 
From ""Love Story"" to ""Bad Blood"" I've got a legacy 
Your singing style's as bland as your insurance policy 

GoCompare this: I'm a songwriter supreme 
You just compare prices, all day like a machine 
My pen game's strong, my message is clear 
You're just a one-hit wonder, no Billboard cheer 

**GoCompare Man**

Hold up Tay, let me get a word in edgewise 
While you're busy writing about boys who wronged you twice 
I'm saving people dough on their premiums each year 
My comparison skills leave yours in fear, tear 

Your ""Reputation""'s built on shallow pop hits high 
Mine's built on trusted advice,'til the consumer sighs 
Informed decisions made easy,'that's what I bring 
Not some vengeful anthem trying to cling to your 15 minutes' sting 

Our flows might differ but both make an impact strong 
Insurance comparisons never goin' wrong 
So step aside Taylor; I won't be ignored 
My savvy advice gives users power galore!
