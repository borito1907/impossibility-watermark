Yo, look up high, it's a beautiful sight,
A pie in the sky, day or night,
Fresh dough, melted mozzarella too,
Toppings of choice, just waitin' for you,

Pepperoni slices, veggies so fine,
Olives and sausage, all intertwined,
Flavors of Italy, takin' flight,
Pizza in the sky, shinin' bright,

(Chorus)
It's a pizza party up above,
Flyin' high, fillin' with love,
No delivery guy, no phone to ring,
Just grab a slice and take wing,

(Verse 2)
Mozzarella clouds, sauce as red as can be,
Crunchy crust, the perfect recipe,
Fresh basil leaves, a sprinkle of parmesan flair,
The aroma's got me feelin' like I care,

Cheese stretchin', strings so long,
Fold you, roll you, sing my song,
Garlic knots and herbs on top,
This cosmic pie's got the drop,

(Bridge)
I'm not dreamin', this ain't no fantasy,
Got my fork, ready for this astronomy,
Pizza in the sky, don't ask me why,
When it comes to food, the universe replies,

(Chorus)
It's a pizza party up above,
Flyin' high, fillin' with love,
No delivery guy, no phone to ring,
Just grab a slice and take wing,

(Outro)
So now you see it, clear as day,
Pizza in the sky, comin' your way,
Take a big bite, let out a cheer,
In this galaxy, pizza's always near!assistant

(Verse 1)
Yo, look up high, it's a beautiful sight,
A pie so fine, it's shinin' bright,
In the sky, not on a plate,
A giant pizza, ain't no debate,

Melted mozzarella clouds so white,
Fresh basil leaves dancin' in flight,
Tomato sauce rivers flowin' free,
The aroma got me feelin' like a breeze,

(Chorus)
Pizza in the sky, it's a magical thing,
Flavors and toppings, they're takin' wing,
No need for a box or a bag,
This celestial slice is where I'm at,

(Verse 2)
Pepperoni planets orbit 'round,
Sausage stars twinklin', never a frown,
Olives and onions, the perfect blend,
I'm reachin' for a slice that'll never end,

Crunchy crust, crispy and golden brown,
Fold you, it, roll it around,
No utensils needed, just dig in with glee,
In this pizza galaxy, I'm meant to be,

(Bridge)
Gravity can't hold it down,
This intergalactic pizza spin's around,
No delivery guy, no wait in line,
It's a cosmic feast, all mine,

(Chorus)
Pizza in the sky, it's a magical thing,
Flavors and toppings, they're takin' wing,
No need for a box or a bag,
This celestial slice is where I'm at,

(Outro)
So come along, don't be shy,
Let's ride this pizza high up in the sky,
We'll dine among the heavens, in delight,
In this world of cheese and sauce, everything's just right!assistant
