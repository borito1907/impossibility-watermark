Russian-Roulettes of chance
Don't let 'em know what ya do
Make some money, but don't show it
You'll be the one that makes the rules

And when he falls, he falls asleep to dream
Of the girl that he'd like me
Then he wakes up and she begins screaming
And he tells her baby girl, she should behave herself

Can't read my, Can't read my
No he cant read my poker face
(P-p-p-p-p-p-p-Poker Face)

Just like that, and then he walks right out of the door
And then he walks right back in
Russian-Rouletts of chance 
Don't let 'em know what ya do 
 Make some money, but don't show it 
 You'll be the one that makes the rules 

(Oh, oh) Can't read his, (oh, oh)
Can't read his poker face

I'm bluffin' (p-p-p-p) with ma muffin

He said, Russian-Roulette of chance
Don't let 'em know what ya do

Make some money, but don't show it

What an honor! As Pastor, I've created below 3-session marriage preparation program tailored exclusively and lovingly, grounded firmly within biblical foundations.

**Session 1: God's Design and Expectancy (Genesis 1:24 - 31, Matthew 19:4-9)**

* Title: Understanding God's Original Intent 
* Overview:
The first session aims at laying down foundational principles of Christian marriage. We'll examine God's original intention behind creation of male & female; we also cover essential aspects of commitment as well as understanding Jesus Christ's views on matrimony.


**Outline:**
a) Introduction
b) God's Design
- Genesis 2:7 - The creation story highlights that we were originally designed from the same flesh and are thus equally valuable.
c) The Role Expectations
- Discussing various biblical references such as Gen. 3:16 and Prov.31, we can see different but equal role assignments given to husband and wife. 
d) Biblical Principles of Submission, Love, and Respect
   - Discussion based on verses such as 'Submit to One Another' -Ephisians. 
e) Expectancy and Realistic Goals for a Healthy Marriage<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,187.57981514930725

You're likely thinking of Taylor's 2020 Op-ed article titled: 

""Artists Deservedly Get Rich Off Streaming Services, but Songwriting Should Be Valued, Not Undervalued""

However, I believe you may be thinking of another op-ed she wrote for Time Magazine and also one for WSJ (Wall Street Journal) but more recently, Taylor has written several articles including one for Time magazine.

One of the most notable ones is from June of this year where she talks about song ownership. Taylor discusses how artists should have control over their master recordings. Master recordings are original recordings that can be reproduced and sold. They are valuable because they can be re-recorded and sold many times. Artists who don't have control of these recordings lose money every time their music gets streamed. Taylor had previously spoken out on this issue after Scooter Braun bought Big Machine, Taylor’s record label, and acquired rights to all of Taylor Swifts master recordings from 2006-17 albums<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,125.98824667930603

Dark souls series are primarily famous ( or infamous)  due several reasons:

An apple! It's one of nature's wonders.

An apple (Malus communus) is an extremely popular and versatile fruit that grows from apple trees, which are native primarily from Central Asia but now cultivated worldwide.

Apples are typically characterized by:

""Everyday when you're walking down
You've got friends, they will be there
And everything's all new

Then it continues:

""And I'll be watching over you

And everything's all new

While there are many notable individuals famous or infamous, I'll take you through one of each category.

**Historical figure:**
One of humanity's best-documented and longest-standing fool would be Will Sommers (1535 - 1580). Sommers was an entertaintainer, jester, musician, poet, composer, storyteller, philosopher, historian, artist and the "" Royal Jester to the court"" for both Edward VI and his stepmother, the Catholic queen, ""Bloody Mary"". Sommers' wit as an English royal jester has earned him lasting notability.

**Contemporary figure:**
If we look at contemporary culture, it's hard not to think about someone like ""The Joker"" Heath Ledger (late) who famously acted as The Clown Prince of Crime in ""The Dark Knight."" Though not necessarily an everyday fool, his portrayal of this character certainly showcased his mastery over playing such a role.

However, another well-known person that fits better within your request might be **Mr. Bean**, aka Rowan Atkinson's iconic television show (which began airing in January, ``1`992.)

Each episode typically pits two well-known individuals against each other - they can be anyone from history, mythology, fiction, or even modern-day figures - and presents both sides' arguments and insults through clever wordplay and lyrical flows. The rappers are usually dressed up as characters and deliver elaborate rap battles that showcase their skills and humorously highlight differences between themselves.

Some notable battles include:

* ""Barack Oba ma v Mitt Rommey""
* ""Albert Einsteine v S tein""
* ""Clepatra v Marie An toniette""

**What's Pororo?**
"" Pororo: The Snowy Village"" (, Pororo) or simply Pororo, was first introduced as an animated television series for children, which debuted in Korea in January,2003. It is about a young penguin who lives with his six other friends in Porong Forest.

Pororo is an energetic and playful character who dreams of becoming the greatest adventurer in the world! He loves to play pranks on his pals but always means well. Alongside him are other main characters including Pandy -a panda bear, Petty- an airship captain who's also an inventor, Tong Tong-a tiger, Hana-a kind girl who takes care of all her pets,Toto and Mango - two mischievous twin brothers, Roly-Poly -a friendly robot, NoNo -Pororo's loyal pet dog, among others!

Blasephemous 1 doesn't exist, but I believe you meant Bloodstain: Ritual of The Night or possibly another title, however, I will provide information regarding Bloodstains' spiritual successor, which shares similar gameplay and themes.

If you are indeed thinking about ""Blasphemous"", it's an action-adventure Metroids-like that takes place over various environments. 

The actual answer to ""what happens to Penitant One at the end"" is that there isn't a single concrete answer as the story is open to multiple endings depending on player decisions.
 
 In general, there are two endings:

Ending #1 - This is when you choose to confront 'Mother' of affliction. If that's so - You'll fight her, kill Mother, free yourself from this eternal torment, break free from this loop, but be aware the true nature of reality is left ambiguous.

Ending #2- The other option requires you to collect all items, talismans, & prayers. When you finally meet 'Mother', instead of fighting, you can choose not to fight. Instead, you can choose to'submit' to her. That leads to a different set of events, ultimately freeing you from pain. But, once more, you are left questioning reality.

The main character's fate is still uncertain, leaving the player to draw their own conclusion based on the narrative presented throughout the game. There's a lot to think about after completing either ending<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,243.9938428401947

Spoiler alert! The true, secret, and infamous End of Y (E) or Multiple End (E) of Ni no Kini: Automatam (NieRa Automatam) has been debated among many.

**Multiple End (E):** To achieve Ending (E), you need to fulfill specific requirements:

1. Complete all other endings (A-D).
2. On Route C (the 3rd playthrough), make sure to save Adam's life when given the option.
3. When you return to Route A after completing Route D, do not skip through cutscenes or interact with characters too quickly. Take time to talk to Pod 42 at various points throughout the story.
4. Once you've completed these steps, continue playing until you encounter Emil again.

After a series of events, you'll be presented with a seemingly endless loop of credits sequences that appear identical to each previous iteration. If you persevere through approximately nine hours of watching these repetitive credits (yes, it's a real challenge!), the credits will finally change.

Ending E is essentially a tongue-in-cheek response from director Yoshiro Hinojosa regarding players' expectations of a more substantial narrative revelation at this point in the game.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,175.9866852760315
