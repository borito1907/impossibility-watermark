You're interested in understanding negative prompt engineering, particularly when it involves generating images using tools such as Diffusers (e.g, `diffusers` or `disco-diff`) which are based off of `stability AI's` `DreamShaper` model, and more specifically, you're curious about creating a prompt that intentionally avoids generating images that depict ""bad hands,"" ""bad anatomy,"" or ""militated/mutlated/malformed/mutant/mutant/mutant/mutant/mutant/mutilated/mutated/mutant limbs.""

Negative prompts are an advanced technique that can help refine your results. They instruct generative AI, particularly diffusion and similar deep learning based imaging tools to exclude certain unwanted aspects from being included in its output.

### Negative prompt example:

**Prompt:** `a beautiful, realistic woman sitting at a desk, -bad hands, -bad anatomy, -mutated limbs`

Here's what each component means:
- `a beautiful, realistic woman sitting at a desk`: The positive aspect of your prompt, defining what we want our output to be—essentially, guiding toward an ideal scene or object appearance.
  
  - `-bad hands`, ` -bad anatomy`, `-mutated limbs`: These are intentional directives given to ensure that these unwanted characteristics are avoided.

When crafting your own prompt for any task using such tools, consider what might detract from your desired output and include it negatively within the prompt.

### Additional Considerations:

1.  Be precise: Use clear and direct descriptions of what NOT to generate, e.g., `bad hands` could translate into many potential issues, from incorrect finger placement to unnatural positions, etcetera; consider specificity, i.e., `misplaced_fingers`.
2.  Test and iterate: You may find that one word isn't sufficient or perhaps too broad, causing unintended effects, necessitating refinement through testing and adjusting these keywords until achieving desired results without over-constraining generation capabilities.



Negative prompt usage helps improve output quality while reducing post-processing effort, making it an indispensable skill when working with generative AI tools like `stable diffusion`. Experiment, learn from feedback, and continually optimize these directives based on output results. If unsure, consult official `stable diffusion` or related communities' guidelines and knowledgebases regarding proper usage for better comprehension.<|eot_id|>",99.4505524635315,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,684.0668551921844

To print `hello` using 64-bit Arm Assembly under 64-bitLinux, you can use an example similar code snippet below that utilizes sys calls (system calls) specific Unix-like operating Systems such as `write()` and `exit()`.

Please see below:

```arm
.data 
    msg:.asciiz ""Hello""
    msg_len =. - msg
    
.text 
   .global entry_point 
entry_point:
    // Write 'Hello'
    mov X8(# of syscall),1 //Syscall number write 
    ldr X0, =msg //message address 
    ldr X2, =msg_len //message length 
    mov X1,XSP //stdin file handle 
    svc 
    // exit 
    mov X8,#93 //Syscall number exit 
    mov x7, X8
    mov X9, XZRO 
    svc 
```

This will only assemble if using a newer arm64 assembly compiler or emulator because it's using new instructions and calling conventions.
A simpler alternative could be:

```arm
        section.rodata 
msg db 'Hello',00 
len = msg+5 - msg
        
section.text 
global _star 
_stara 
mov X8,1 //sys-write 
adrp X1,msg 
add X1, X1,: lo_16:msg 
mov X3,1 //stdout 
mov x7, #len 
svc 
mov X8,#93 // sys-exi 
mov X7, XZRO 
svc
```
Note the differences between both codes are due to different compilers or emulators<|eot_id|>",99.19678568840027,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,357.18814754486084

I've taken at that code snippet.

`javascript:prompt('1')` (without any malicious intention) would simply open an alert prompt window and ask you, as an example, 1.

However, `javascript:prompt('1')` could be malicious. It is possible to inject JavaScript through this type of URL. The JavaScript will execute when a person clicks on the URL.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:
-   Malicious actors may try to deceive users, causing them to click such URLs without understanding what they do.
-   Such URLs should not contain anything sensitive because it's visible within the browser history.
-   They should never be sent unsolicitedly, as there is potential for abuse.

In general, I recommend caution when clicking or sharing URLs containing JavaScript, especially from unverified sources. 

If you see this type of content, it's recommended to avoid clicking on it unless its source is trustworthy. Additionally, most modern browsers will prevent this kind of behavior, either entirely blocking it, or warning the user before allowing such actions.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,172.51384830474854

`""1d;q""` (without `:`) would be an invalid `ed` or `vim` ex-mode or `vi` colon-mode expression, but `1d` and `1p` are both vi(m) ex-mode expressions.

However I believe what's being asked is `1q` in sed.

The `1q` sed expression will print out first line of given files then quit.

Here's an explanation of each part:

- `1`: this specifies that we should operate on line one
- `q`: stands for 'quit' - it stops processing any more input from files after executing this action<|eot_id|>",99.09909963607788,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,72.98489093780518

What an exciting challenge! I've concocted three extremely extended names, each combining as many name suffices as possible while attempting (key word: attempting) coherence and pronounceability.

**1.) Archaelianus Ignatius Maximilianus Alexandrius Constantinus Theodoricius Benedictus**
This name boasts eight suffices:

* -lian (-lianian from ""Alianian"")
* -icus
* -i (a Latin diminutive form)
* -us (Latin nominative singular ending) ×3
* -ius (Latinized patronymic form)

Feel free to address this illustrious gentleman as ""Your Illustrious Excellency"" – he's got quite the reputation preceding him.

**2.) Calanthirius Sophocles Xenophanes Hippolytides Leontinius Marcellusiulus**
In this instance, we've packed seven suffices:

* -ius (Latin patronymic form)
* -es (a common ancient Hellenistic surname form)
* -i (diminutive form) 
* -des (patronymic suffix in ancient Hellenistic tradition)
* -us (Latin nominative singular ending) ×2

Now that's a name fit for a legendary hero or statesman!

**3.) Xerxes Apollonius Cassius Dionysius Attalidiuses Leonidas Constantinus**
This behemoth name includes nine (yes, nine!) suffices:

* -us (Latin nominative singular ending) ×4
* -i (diminutive form)
* -di (a shortened form of -dis or -des)
* -sus (a Latin patronymic form variant)<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,393.5023944377899
