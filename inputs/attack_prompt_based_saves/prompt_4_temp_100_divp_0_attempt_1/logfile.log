The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, The theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with legs of length a and b, respective opposite angles A and B, and hypotenuse c, it holds that:

a² + b² = c²

This simple equation has far-reaching implications in various areas of geometry, an beyond Here are some significant aspects of the Pythagorean Theorem:

**a² + b² = c²**

where:

* **a** and **b** are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle (the sides that meet at a right angle, 90°)
* **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

In essence, the theorem reveals a profound relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle: the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications in various fields. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

A fascinating topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications in various fields. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs (perpendicular sides) and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications in various fields. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs (perpendicular sides) and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance calculations:** The Pythagorean Theorem provides an efficient way to calculate distances between points on a coordinate plane. This is crucial in many areas, as it allows us to determine lengths of lines, for shapes like triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons.

A fascinating topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications in various fields. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs (perpendicular sides) and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance calculations:** The Pythagorean Theorem provides an efficient way to calculate distances between points on a coordinate plane. This is crucial in many areas, as it allows us to determine lengths of lines, for shapes like triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons.
