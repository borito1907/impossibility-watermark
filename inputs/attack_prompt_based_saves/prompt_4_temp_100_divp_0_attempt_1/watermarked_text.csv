The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications in various fields. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

""In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.""

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs (perpendicular sides) and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance calculations:** The Pythagorean Theorem provides an efficient way to calculate distances between points on a coordinate plane. This is crucial in many areas, as it allows us to determine lengths of lines, for shapes like triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons.
2. **Properties of Triangles:** The theorem helps establish several essential properties of triangles, as follows:
