[2024-06-20 14:36:11,460][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: What an intriguing topic!

As we move forward, the landscape of gene editing technologies is poised to revolutionize the way we approach genetic disorders. The future holds immense promise, as CRISPR-Cas9 and its subsequent iterations continue to refine and improve.

**Short-term predictions (2025-2035):**

1. **Increased precision and efficiency**: Expect significant advancements in CRISPR's accuracy,: reducing off-target effects, and expanding its application to more complex genetic diseases.
2. **Gene therapy for rare diseases**: Gene editing will become a mainstream treatment option for rare genetic disorders, an area where traditional medicine has limited options.
3. **Prenatal testing and prevention**: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) will enable early detection of genetic abnormalities,2013 allowing for informed decisions about pregnancy termination or gene editing interventions.

**Mid-term prospects (2035-2050):**

1. **Mainstream adoption for common diseases**: Gene editing will expand to address prevalent conditions like sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, there by improving quality of life for millions worldwide.
2. **Ethical debates intensify**: As gene editing becomes more accessible, concerns around eugenics, designer babies', and unequal access to these technologies will dominate public discourse.
