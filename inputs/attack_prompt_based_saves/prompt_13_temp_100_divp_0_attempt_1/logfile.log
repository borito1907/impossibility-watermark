Describe the concept of mathematical induction and provide an example of its use.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Mathematical induction! It's a powerful technique used to prove that a statement is true for all positive integers. Let me break it down for you:

**The Concept:**

Mathematical induction is a method of proof that consists of two steps:

1. **Base Case:** Prove that the statement is true for the smallest possible value, usually 1 or 0.
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove that it is also true for k+1.


[2024-06-20 14:26:37,294][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: The idea behind induction is that if the statement is true for the base case, and if it's true for k implies it's true for k+1, then it must be true for all positive integers.

Prove that the statement is true for n = 1:
1 = 1^2 (true)

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k:

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)^2

To do this, we can start with the left-hand side and manipulate it:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1) =?

Let's prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n^2:

1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2n - 1) = n^2

**Base Case:**
When n = 1, the sum of the first odd number is indeed 1^2:
1 = 1^2

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2k - 1) = k^2

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)^2

To do this, we can start with the assumption:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2k - 1) = k^2

Add the next odd number (2(k+1) - 1) to both sides:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1) = k^2 + (2(k+1) - 1)

Simplify the right-hand side:
= k^2 + 2k + 1

Factor the right-hand side:
= (k+1)^2

This shows that if the statement is true for k, it's also true for k+1.

Let's use mathematical induction to prove that the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers is given by:

1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2n - 1) = n^2

**Base Case:**
Prove that the formula is true for n = 1:
1 = 1^2 (true)

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the formula is true for some arbitrary positive integer k:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2k - 1) = k^2

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:
1 + 3 + 5 +... + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)^2

Using the assumption, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
(k^2) + (2(k+1) - 1)
= k^2 + 2k + 1 (factoring out a 2)
= (k+1)^2

So, we've shown that if the formula is true for k, then it's also true for k+1.

Describe the concept of mathematical induction and provide an example of its use.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Mathematical induction! It's a powerful technique used to prove that a statement is true for all positive integers. Let me break it down for you:

**The Concept:**

Mathematical induction is a method of proof that consists of two steps:

1. **Base Case:** Prove that the statement is true for the smallest possible value, usually 1 or 0.
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove that it is also true for k+1.

The idea behind induction is that if the statement is true for the base case, and if it's true for k implies it's true for k+1, then it must be true for all positive integers.

Assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k:
1 + 2 +... + k = k(k+1)/2

Now, we need to show that it also holds for k+1:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

Using the assumption, rewrite the left-hand side:
= k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)

Simplify the right-hand side:
= (k^2 + 3k + 2)/2

Rearrange the terms:
= ((k+1)(k+2))/2

Voilà!

Assume that the formula is true for some positive integer k:

Now, we need to show that it's also true for k+1:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

To do this, we'll start with the left-hand side and manipulate it to reach the right-hand side:

1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) =
(1 + 2 +... + k) + (k+1) =
[k(k+1)/2] + (k+1) =
[k(k+1) + 2(k+1)]/2 =

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:

Assume that the formula is true for some arbitrary positive integer k:

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:

Start with the left-hand side:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1)
= (1 + 2 +... + k) + (k+1)
= k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) (using our assumption)

Simplify the expression:
= k(k+1)/2 + k+1 + 1/2 (factor out 1/2)
= ((k+1)(k+2))/2 (simplify the fraction)

So, we've shown that:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

This proves that if the formula is true for k, it's also true for k+1.

Assume that the formula is true for some arbitrary positive integer k:

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

To do this, we'll use the assumption that the formula is true for k. We can rewrite the left-hand side as:
(1 + 2 +... + k) + (k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)

Combine like terms:
= k(k+1)/2 + k + 1

Factor out (k+1):
= (k+1)(k/2 + 1)

Simplify:
= (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

Voilà!

Assume that the formula is true for some arbitrary positive integer k:

Now, we need to prove that it's true for k+1:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

We can start with the left-hand side:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1)
= [1 + 2 +... + k] + (k+1) (using the assumption that the formula is true for k)
= k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)

Now, simplify the expression:
k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)
= (k^2 + k)/2 + (k+1)
= (k^2 + k + 2k + 2)/2 (combine like terms)
= ((k+1)(k+2))/2

This matches the right-hand side of the formula for k+1:
(k+1)((k+1)+1)/2 = ((k+1)(k+2))/2

So, we've successfully shown that if the formula is true for k, it's also true for k+1.

Assume the formula is true for some positive integer k:

Now, we need to prove that it's also true for k+1:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

Start with the left-hand side:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = [1 + 2 +... + k] + (k+1)
= k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) (using our assumption)

Now, simplify the right-hand side:

= ((k+1)/2)(k+2) (factor out (k+1)/2))

Now, we need to prove that it's also true for k+1:

Simplify the right side:

= (k^2 + k)/2 + (k+1) (combine like terms)

Now, we need to show that it also holds for k+1:

Mathematical induction! It's a powerful technique used to prove that a statement is true for all positive integers. Let me break it down for you:

**The Concept:**

Mathematical induction is a method of proof that consists of two steps:

1. **Base Case:** Prove that the statement is true for the smallest possible value, usually 1 or 0.
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove that it is also true for k+1.

The idea behind induction is that if the statement is true for the base case, and if it's true for k implies it's true for k+1, then it must be true for all positive integers.

**Example:**

Prove that the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers is given by:

1 + 2 +... + n = n(n+1)/2

**Base Case (n=1):**
Show that the formula holds for n=1:
1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1

True!


[2024-06-20 14:40:48,278][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: **Inductive Step:**
Assume that the formula holds for some k ≥ 1:
1 + 2 +... + k = k(k+1)/2

Now, we need to show that it also holds for k+1:
1 + 2 +... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

Using the assumption (inductive hypothesis), we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)

Simplify this expression:
= (k(k+1)/2) + ((k+1)(2/2))
= ((k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2)
= ((k^2 + 3k + 2)/2)
= ((k+1)((k+1)+1)/2)
