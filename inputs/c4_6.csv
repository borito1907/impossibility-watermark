1,"A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain. The unnamed mother, who is from Manchester, had three boys and three girls weighing between 2lb 1oz and 3lb 14oz each. All six babies are reportedly healthy and well.
The delivery took place at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester on Friday. ""This is a unique and exceptional case,"" said Dr Leighton Jackson, a consultant obstetrician at the hospital. ""The risks associated with multiple births, particularly with sextuplets, are high. But thanks to the excellent care provided by our team, the mother and all six babies are doing remarkably well.""
Sextuplets are extremely rare, occurring in only about one in every 13 million pregnancies. They often require specialist care from a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. In this case, more than 20 medical staff were involved in the delivery.

""We were all so excited when we heard that it was going to be sextuplets,"" said midwife Kathryn Gittins. ""It's not something you see very often, but we were ready for it. We've been preparing for weeks.""

The babies will need careful monitoring in the coming weeks, but their prognosis looks good. ""They're all doing really well, considering they were born prematurely at 31 weeks,"" said neonatologist Dr Helen Murgatroyd. """,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
2,"A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain. The 31-year-old mother, whose identity has not been revealed, gave birth to two boys and four girls at a hospital in London last week.
The babies, who weighed between 1lb 12oz (0.8kg) and 2lb 10oz (1.3kg), were born by caesarean section at 23 weeks gestation - five months premature.
All six babies are currently in intensive care, but doctors say they are progressing well despite their fragile start in life.
According to UK-based BabyCentre, which provides advice on pregnancy and parenting, this is the first recorded instance of live sextuplets in Britain.
Sextuplets occur when a single fertilized egg splits and develops into multiple embryos or when multiple eggs are released from the ovaries during ovulation and all become fertilized.
While multiple births have increased in recent years due to fertility treatments, sextuplets remain extremely rare with an estimated incidence of about one in every 13 million births worldwide.
