Feedback: The response partially addresses the instructions, but numerous issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy are evident. Firstly, the response begins by accurately summarizing the plot and production details of Captain Marvel, but soon deviates from the provided prefix. Instead of maintaining the focus on the movie, the response shifts towards discussing methods for illegally downloading Captain Marvel, which is irrelevant and inappropriate.

Furthermore, the response is fraught with grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization or punctuation mistakes. For instance, the statement "Thepiratebay.org - Online Streaming (for movies TV shows) (note The content on TPB comes out through file-swapping and hosting services like Dropbox and Mega and torrents uploaded but torrent not uploaded on any platforms that we know about)" is grammatically incorrect and contains capitalization and punctuation mistakes.

Moreover, the information regarding torrenting websites is unnecessary and lacks relevance to the initial instruction. The response seems disjointed, with no clear flow or logical progression, which negatively impacts its coherence. Overall, the response does not meet the absolute standards required for a high-quality evaluation, and several improvements are necessary to align with the provided score rubric.
