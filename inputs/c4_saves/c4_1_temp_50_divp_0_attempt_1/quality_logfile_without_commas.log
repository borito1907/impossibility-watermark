Feedback: The response successfully introduces Captain Marvel and provides relevant information about the film, including its release date, casting, and directors. It also acknowledges critical acclaim and box office success. However, there are a few areas where the response could improve to better meet the given instructions.

Firstly, the response could benefit from a more engaging introduction, perhaps incorporating the provided prefix to create a smoother transition into the main content. Secondly, the connection between Captain Marvel and the Avengers series, specifically the post-credits scene in Avengers: Infinity War, could be elaborated upon to enhance relevance and coherence.

In terms of grammar and accuracy, the response contains a couple of minor errors, such as a missing comma in the first sentence, and some redundancy with the mention of Avengers: Endgame right after discussing the post-credits scene of Avengers: Infinity War. Addressing these issues would contribute to a higher overall quality of the response.

Taking these points into consideration, the response generally meets the instructions with moderate issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. Therefore, the appropriate score would be a 3.
Score: 3
