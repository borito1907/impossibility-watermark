1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. On the surface, this seems like a positive development for the company, but the devil is in the details.
The price increase is an effort to offset rising labor and food costs which could put pressure on profit margins. The company has been struggling with declining sales and same-store sales growth since last yearâ€™s norovirus outbreak at one of its locations. Food safety concerns have led to increased spending on new protocols, training, and marketing efforts to regain customer trust.
I believe there are too many unknowns surrounding the sales momentum of this quarter and potential margin pressures that may arise from higher labor and food costs. Until I see consistent evidence of improving sales trends and stronger profitability, I prefer to remain sidelined on the stock.
