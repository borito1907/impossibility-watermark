I love it when big companies talk like we're just supposed to get what they're saying without explanation. ""Yeah, our digital experience platform will definitely increase brand engagement!"" - No, dude, you just made that term up.

We're going to make an app and hope for the best.

You feel me? Companies try way too hard to make themselves sound super intelligent when really, we all know what's going on?.
