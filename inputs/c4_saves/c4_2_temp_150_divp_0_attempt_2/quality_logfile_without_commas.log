Feedback: The response shows a casual and conversational tone, however, it lacks coherence and depth when addressing the complex issue of Chipotle's recent struggles. The response jumps from one thought to another without a clear structure, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, repetitions, and informal language usage, which detracts from the overall quality. Furthermore, the response does not accurately summarize the article, showing a lack of attention to detail and understanding of the main points. The response fails to address the severity of Chipotle's situation and instead focuses on trivial matters, showing a lack of relevance to the prompt. Despite the attempt to infuse humor and personal opinions, the response falls short of the required standard due to its incoherent structure, grammatical errors, and irrelevant content.
