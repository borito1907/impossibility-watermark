Feedback: The response adequately addresses the prompt, providing a concise analysis of Chipotle's current challenges and potential solutions. The writer effectively highlights the issues of slowed growth and expanding costs, presenting them in a clear and relevant manner. Additionally, the response offers specific strategies for Chipotle to regain its former success, demonstrating an understanding of the business context.

However, there are a few minor grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes, such as the missing hyphen in "better-days" and the comma splice in "But investors looking forward want more â€“ they want profits." These errors do not significantly impair the overall quality of the response but do detract slightly from its coherence and accuracy.

Furthermore, while the response is relevant and coherent, it does not fully capture the sense of urgency and volatility conveyed in the original text. The E. coli outbreak and its impact on sales are mentioned but not explored in depth. This lack of detail results in a less comprehensive analysis.

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively communicates key points. However, minor grammatical and punctuation errors, along with room for greater detail on certain aspects, prevent it from achieving a perfect score.
Score: 4
