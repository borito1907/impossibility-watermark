Feedback: The response adequately addresses the initial prompt by summarizing Captain Marvel's plot and introducing some of the cast members, albeit not exhaustively as in the original text. However, there are notable issues in coherence and relevance. The inclusion of a quote from Ryan Coogler discussing Black Panther is irrelevant to the given task, causing confusion and deviating from the main topic. Additionally, the grammar, although mostly correct, contains some errors, and there are punctuation mistakes throughout the text, such as missing commas in the first sentence. The response also fails to mention key elements from the original text, such as the directors of Captain Marvel and the specific characters played by the returning Marvel Cinematic Universe actors. Overall, the response does not meet the high standards of coherence, relevance, and accuracy required for a score of 5.
Score: 3
