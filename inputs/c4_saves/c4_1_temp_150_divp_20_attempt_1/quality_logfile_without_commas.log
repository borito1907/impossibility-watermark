Feedback: The response appears to lack a coherent and creative completion of the given prefix, resulting in a disjointed and fragmented account of Captain Marvel. Multiple irrelevant elements, including references to YTS, YIFY downloads, and torrent links, have been inserted into the text, which significantly deviates from the original context and task. The language used in these segments features numerous grammatical errors, repetitions, capitalization mistakes, and punctuation issues. Additionally, the response includes a mention of the Captain Marvel costume in a video game, which further strays from the given instruction.

Considering the extent of the issues mentioned above, the overall quality of the response is significantly affected. While there are no apparent issues with relevance to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the response still falls short in terms of coherence and accuracy, given the irrelevant insertions and lack of a clear narrative thread. As such, the response fails to demonstrate a strong understanding of the task and the required standards, resulting in a lower score.
Score: 2
