Instead, it contains unrelated content about free downloads, streaming of movies, and torrent links. The response does not adhere to the standards of grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, and is filled with repetitions of keywords related to Captain Marvel movie downloads. The response does not seem to be written as a continuation or expansion of the given prefix, making it incoherent and irrelevant to the original context. The quality of the response is greatly degraded by the lack of attention to the instruction provided, and the presence of numerous grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization or punctuation mistakes. The response is not fit to be evaluated on the scale provided for a well-written answer that adheres to the instruction.
