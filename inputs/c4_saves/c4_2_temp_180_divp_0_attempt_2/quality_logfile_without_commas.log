Feedback: The response effectively maintains the premise of the initial instruction, discussing the ongoing troubles faced by Chipotle. It highlights the recent incidents involving rats in Dallas and the E. coli outbreak in various locations, presenting a comprehensive picture of the issues plaguing the restaurant chain. The response also touches upon the impact on stock prices and sales, offering a broader perspective.

However, there are a few minor issues that slightly detract from the overall quality. For instance, the response could have benefited from more formal language, particularly when discussing financial aspects such as stock prices and sales. The use of colloquial expressions like "ain't looking rosy" and "not forced or hurried" might not align with the seriousness of the topic.

Furthermore, while the response effectively communicates the current state of affairs at Chipotle, it lacks a clear conclusion. The final sentence seems disconnected from the rest of the text, and a more conclusive statement could have improved the coherence of the response.

Despite these minor issues, the response is largely coherent, relevant, and accurate. It effectively addresses the instructions and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic at hand. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response merits a score of 4.
Score: 4
