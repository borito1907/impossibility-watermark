1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First there were rats in Dallas,'the store and recently E-coli contamination outbreaks have been reported by patrons in several locations including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Virginia and New York. The brand has dropped so steeply my friend Mike dropped their stocks before they bottomed out (he's also an expert investor). So yeah things ain't looking rosy at this former favorite burrito & bowl establishment, that was quick service done very, very well.

I can understand the disappointment many face but personally I was never truly smitten with their limited options; just too repetitive for my taste profile preferences. Yet the sheer convenience of them being EVERYWHREE, made it forgivable...or did, back when quality controlled held its own. Those were decent subs before you consider a 'Chip' of something greater.

This may not signal doom right off the bat (as all we need is more food safety vigilance), but for now it may behoove one exploring new or old alternatives...

Let our stomach voices raise in agreement: Time Out.

For those still faithful out thereâ€”do go on, support your locals still and maybe things'll turnaround once a re-examination of internal practices gets worked out; heck, people are fiercely loyal...just watch a McDonald's crowd.

But others will naturally branch into other Quick Serve/ Mexi-Cali cuisine faves; for now I don't feel forced or hurried back into the mix.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
