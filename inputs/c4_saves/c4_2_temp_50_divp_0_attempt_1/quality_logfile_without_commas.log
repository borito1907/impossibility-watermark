Feedback: The response provided does address the prompt, albeit loosely, by mentioning the problems faced by Chipotle and its customers. However, it fails to maintain a consistent focus on the recent E. coli outbreak, which was the main subject of the prompt. Instead, it touches upon various unrelated issues such as whole wheat tortilla shortage, staffing shortages, and logistical challenges related to guacamole and sour cream availability. This lack of focus and relevance detracts from the overall quality of the response.

In terms of grammar, the response has several errors, including missing commas, incorrect verb usage, and awkward sentence constructions. These issues affect the coherence and clarity of the response. For example, the phrase "I hope they get it together soon!" seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the response. Additionally, the use of hashtags is informal and inappropriate for a written response.

Despite the issues mentioned, the response does make an effort to provide some context and background information about Chipotle's recent struggles. It references the company's attempts to improve customer satisfaction and mentions the role of social media in expressing disappointment and frustration. However, these points are scattered throughout the response and do not form a cohesive narrative.

Overall, the response has several notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, making it difficult to follow and understand. While it does address the prompt, it fails to do so effectively or with the necessary level of detail and precision. Therefore, the response warrants a lower score based on the provided score rubric.
Score: 2
