In addition to the supply chain issues, some locations were also experiencing staffing shortages, which further exacerbated the problem.

""We're working diligently to resolve these issues as quickly as possible,"" said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's chief communications officer, in an email statement to Nation's Restaurant News. ""We appreciate our customers' patience and loyalty during this time.""

The burrito chain has been working to revamp its operations and improve customer satisfaction after a series of food safety incidents in recent years. The company has made efforts to increase transparency, enhance training for employees, and implement new protocols to prevent future incidents.

However, the latest issue with guacamole and sour cream availability is unrelated to food safety and instead stems from logistical challenges. The company is working to rectify the situation and ensure that all menu items are available at its locations.

In the meantime, fans of the brand have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration. Some have even joked about starting a petition to ""Save the Guac"" or created memes poking fun at the situation.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
