1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First the burrito-gate scandal, now this. The company's stock price took a  nosedive after it reported disappointing earnings and announced plans to increase menu prices amid higher food costs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.'s stock plummeted as much as 10% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company said it fell short of analyst estimates for fourth-quarter profit and revenue. The chain also warned that rising labor and food costs would pressure its margins this year.
""We are not satisfied with our performance,"" Brian Niccol, who became CEO last March, said in a statement. ""We are committed to improving our operations, enhancing our customer experience, and driving sustainable growth.""
The news was a gut punch to investors, who had been hoping for a turnaround at the beleaguered fast-food chain. Instead, they got a mixed bag: While same-store sales rose 2%, driven by higher prices and increased traffic, profit margins were squeezed by rising costs, including those for avocados and labor.

Shares traded as low as $555.50 in extended trading, down from their close of $617.79 on Tuesday.
