Feedback: The provided response does contain some relevant information, specifically mentioning Captain Marvel's box office success and some aspects of the plot. However, it lacks coherence and relevance in many parts, often straying away from the original prompt by discussing topics such as the release date on streaming services and availability of tickets. These digressions do not contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the Captain Marvel movie or its characters. Furthermore, there are noticeable grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes, such as missing commas in complex sentences and incorrect verb tenses. These issues detract from the overall quality and clarity of the response. The response also fails to address some key points from the original prompt, like the involvement of other Marvel characters and the unique aspects of Danvers' character. Overall, the response demonstrates some effort but falls short in terms of coherence, relevance, and grammatical accuracy, which would lead to a lower score.
Score: 3
