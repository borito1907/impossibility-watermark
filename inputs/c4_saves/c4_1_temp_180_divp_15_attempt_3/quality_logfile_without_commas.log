Feedback: The response generally adheres to the instructions, discussing the Captain Marvel movie while making references to the 1990s setting and the actors involved. However, there are several issues that detract from the overall quality of the response.

Firstly, the response lacks coherence and organization, with a disjointed flow that jumps between discussing the movie's success at the box office and the directors' comments on the character's humanity. This makes it difficult for the reader to follow along and understand the main points being made.

Secondly, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the response. For example, the sentence "In just three months, Marvel's Captain Marvel will make her debut on the big screen, starring Brie Larson as the iconic hero" is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is clunky and could be improved upon. Similarly, the sentence "Marvel Studios' "Captain Marvel" broke through the fourth wall last month with impressive opening-day numbers and shattered another obstacle Tuesday afternoon â€” surpassing $500M at." is confusing and could be clarified to improve understanding.

Thirdly, the response includes irrelevant information, such as references to the Kree and unrelated movie releases, which distract from the main focus of the prompt. Additionally, the response lacks accuracy in some areas, such as the assertion that the movie has only been out for two weeks when it was released over a month prior to the response.

Overall, while the response does touch on the key points of the prompt, it falls short in terms of coherence, grammar, relevance, and accuracy. These issues prevent the response from achieving a higher score.
Score: 3
