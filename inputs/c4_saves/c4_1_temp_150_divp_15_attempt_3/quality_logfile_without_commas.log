Feedback: The response does address the initial instruction but falls short of providing a comprehensive review of Captain Marvel, as it primarily focuses on promoting other Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) content, such as trailers, posters, and other articles. Although the inclusion of quotes from Comic-Con and information about the film's release date align with the prompt, the response lacks depth, engaging analysis, and the full cast list provided in the instruction.

Moreover, there are noticeable grammatical errors and a lack of coherence in the way the information is presented. The text reads more like a collection of headlines and clickbait phrases rather than a cohesive summary or review of Captain Marvel. These issues detract from the overall quality of the response and lower its effectiveness in addressing the instructions.

Finally, the response could have included more details about the characters, plot, or themes present in the film to enhance its relevance and accuracy. The lack of development in these areas makes the response feel less substantial compared to the expected output based on the given score rubric.

Taking these factors into account, the response merits a score of 2, as it partially addresses the instructions but has notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.
Score: 2
