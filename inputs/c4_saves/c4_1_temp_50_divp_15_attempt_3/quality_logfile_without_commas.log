Feedback: The response does address the instructions to a certain extent, providing a brief overview of Captain Marvel, its release, and reception. However, there are several issues that impact the overall quality of the response.

Firstly, the response lacks coherence and relevance. While it mentions that Captain Marvel was released in March 2019 and grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, it does not provide specific details about the plot or characters mentioned in the instruction. Furthermore, the response jumps from discussing the film's release and reception to praising its portrayal of Carol Danvers as a strong character and its exploration of themes such as feminism and empowerment, without connecting these points back to the original prompt.

Secondly, the response contains inaccuracies. For instance, it states that "Captain Marvel was released on March 8, 2019, to mixed reviews from critics," but fails to mention that the film was actually released on March 8, 2019, in the United States and on February 22, 2019, in some countries. Additionally, the statement "Despite this, it was a commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide" is not accurate, as this information refers to the film's global box office performance rather than its critical reception.

Lastly, there are grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes throughout the response. For example, the phrase "The movie also stars Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Jude Law" should have a comma after "Jackson," while the sentence "She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" uses too many commas and lacks proper punctuation.

Considering these factors, the response does not meet the high standards of grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy required for a score of 5. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 2, indicating that it partially addresses the instructions with notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.
Score: 2
