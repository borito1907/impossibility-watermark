1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First,oxed by their ""food safety"" record and now this - http://www.wsj.com/articles/chipotl...
It is tough to be in the fast casual Mexican space these days.  First you have all kinds of recalls (Chipotle and Del Taco) and now you have issues with transparency regarding ingredient sourcing, etc... it seems like you cant catch a break.  And add to that labor issues and minimum wage hikes... ugh 
On another note, have you seen what Blaze has been doing on the digital front?  Very interesting stuff https://youtu.be/rOZU3W5hHJw. Blazin Rewards just hit 1M subscribers and seems to be making strides...

I did not expect my first post to stir up so much conversation! I think it is clear that many in the industry are still reeling from the recent health crisis at Chipotle, and rightfully so. It is always disheartening to see a major food chain deal with such issues.

As for Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza's digital efforts, they do seem to be on the right track. Their Blazin' Rewards program offers guests rewards and personalized promotions based on their purchase history and preferences, which can help drive sales and increase customer loyalty.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
