1,"When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. I'm excited to explore the possibilities that these new technologies have made and see how they'll change our approach to chronic disease management.

Let's get started!

**Task**: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patients' free-form text inputs about their diabetes symptoms and habits, creating structured outputs that provide personalized insights.

Our system should include multiple components: **Data Input**, **NLP Engine**, **Rule-based Classification**, and **Data Analytics**.

Here's an outline to guide you:

### Requirements

1. Design and implement a natural language processing (NLP) engine for analyzing patient entries and classifying their data into structured formats.
   - The NLP component must detect keywords, patterns, and sentiment in unstructured text to extract relevant health information from user input.
   - Use named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, stemming, lemmatization, and dependency parsing to identify relevant clinical concepts, relationships between them, and context.
   - Integrate the developed NLP framework with popular libraries like spacy, gensim, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for better performance and scalability.

2. Implement a rule-based classification mechanism that categorizes extracted health data into specific categories, such as medication regimen adherence, symptoms, lifestyle changes, physical activity levels, eating habit modifications, mental well-being, stress coping, social support, quality of sleep, stress level, cognitive function, cardiovascular risks, medication compliance, food intake regulation, substance abuse behavior detection.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
