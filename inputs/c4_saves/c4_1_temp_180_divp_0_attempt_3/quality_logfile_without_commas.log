Feedback: The response has several problems related to grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. First, the response repeats certain phrases such as "Captain Marvel," "box offices," and "opening weekend," which is unnecessary and makes the text less smooth. Furthermore, the response contains incomplete sentences and fragments, indicating issues with grammar.

The coherence of the response is also compromised by the lack of a clear structure. The information provided does not flow logically, and it seems like the response has been assembled hastily from various sources without proper integration.

In terms of relevance, the response does mention Captain Marvel and the box office success, which is somewhat relevant to the initial prompt. However, it fails to maintain a consistent focus on the original topic. Instead, it jumps abruptly between discussing the movie's performance, casting, and production, making it difficult to follow and understand the intended message.

Accuracy is another area where the response falls short. There are factual errors regarding box office estimates and opening weekend figures, which detract from the credibility of the information presented. The use of inaccurate and unverified data further weakens the response.

Overall, the response has significant issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. These problems greatly degrade the quality of the response and prevent it from effectively addressing the given instructions. Based on the score rubric, a score of 2 is appropriate for this response.
