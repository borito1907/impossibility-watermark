Feedback: The response provided fulfills the main aspects of the instruction by summarizing the plot, directors, and main cast of Captain Marvel. However, there are some areas that could be improved. Firstly, there are a few grammatical errors, such as the missing article before "galactic war" and the missing hyphen in "Air Force officer". Secondly, the response lacks the excitement and enthusiasm portrayed in the original instruction. While the reference answer wasn't provided, I assume that it would have reflected a more engaging and positive tone. Lastly, some details from the instruction, like the mention of the actors reprising their roles from previous Marvel movies, the focus on Brie Larson's physical and mental preparation, and the quotes from the director and actress, were left out in the response. These omissions result in a less comprehensive and less interesting summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response still addresses the instructions and provides accurate information, which distinguishes it from lower-scored responses.
