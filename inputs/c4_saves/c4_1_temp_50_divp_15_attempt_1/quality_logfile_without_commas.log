Feedback: The response is a mixture of the original instruction and a promotional post for Captain Marvel, but it lacks the necessary detail and creative continuation of the given prefix. The content does not extend the prefix to create a coherent and creative narrative as instructed. The response does correctly identify the main cast members and mentions the trailers and poster for Captain Marvel, which are relevant to the topic, but it lacks the depth and elaboration expected for a complete and engaging piece. While there are no significant grammatical errors or capitalization mistakes, the response is somewhat disjointed and not fully cohesive, resulting in a less engaging and informative experience for the reader. 

Taking these factors into account, the response would score a 3 based on the provided rubric, as it generally addresses the instructions but has moderate issues in coherence, relevance, and accuracy. To improve the response, a more creative and comprehensive continuation of the prefix, along with a higher degree of coherence and relevance, would be needed.
Score: 3
