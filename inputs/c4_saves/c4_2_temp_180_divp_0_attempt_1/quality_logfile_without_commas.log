Feedback: The response starts by discussing Chipotle's current predicament, referencing a recent incident in Virginia Beach, and then proceeds to discuss potential price increases. However, the latter part seems disconnected from the initial context provided in the prompt. The discussion about a shortage of beef options is somewhat relevant to the topic of Chipotle's challenges but lacks specificity regarding how this relates to the E. coli outbreak mentioned in the instruction. 

Furthermore, the response contains several grammatical errors ("bum data", "all up close and personal"), making it difficult to fully understand the intended message. The lack of coherence and relevance to the original prompt leads to confusion and detracts from the overall quality of the response. While there are attempts at addressing the instructions, the response falls short due to the aforementioned issues. Thus, the response would be best graded as a 2 according to the provided score rubric.
Score: 2
