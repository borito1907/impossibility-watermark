Feedback: The response begins with a relevant tweet about the difficult time for Chipotle lovers, aligning well with the given instruction. The tweets that follow demonstrate a coherent flow of thought and progression in discussing the situation. However, there are some instances of repetitive language, such as using 'Chipotle' excessively, which could be refined for better flow.

In terms of grammar, there are a few minor errors that do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the content. The capitalization and punctuation are mostly correct, with only occasional mistakes, such as missing commas and capitalization of hashtags.

The response maintains relevance to the original article by addressing the ongoing challenges faced by Chipotle. However, it lacks the depth and detail provided in the reference answer. It briefly touches upon the proposed safety measures but does not delve into their potential effectiveness or implications for the company.

Considering the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response demonstrates moderate issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. There are no major problems, but the response could benefit from further refinement in terms of language use and depth of content.

Based on the analysis, the response receives a score of 3.
