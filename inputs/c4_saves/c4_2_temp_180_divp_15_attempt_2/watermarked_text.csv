1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. I hope things will get better.
Chipotleâ€™s reputation continues to suffer and even with changes made, the past few months they struggled to rebuild trust.
I just got back a few times, it was great in fact the new way they prepare some items has improved flavors and overall freshness however there must have Been some corporate mistake or maybe not getting new orders out there quick enough? I am very surprised at stock going down so much? It makes me thing there Is Much more too this and they are gonna get sued over these recalls? I have faith In them fixing everything ASAP they will Get through And come Back Strong! The Food I Had Recentry Was Excellent Again!
You can still buy into CMG despite the downturn. Some analysts see value here due to CMG trading near  8 times forward earnings (a discount). Chipotle also has cash rich on its balance sheet, giving room for potential dividends & M&A.
Not convinced by the bull argument here either though, sorry ðŸ™‚ CMG faces major reputation hits + supply-chain management risks in their efforts to maintain food quality and avoid future outbreaks & contamination situations. Not an easy road ahead indeed. That being said, the best recovery is still possible as long as strong commitments and strategic moves towards that from within and especially outside perspectives would make all needed sense.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
