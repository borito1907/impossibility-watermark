1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the bad press about food safety and now this.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said it expects to restate its financial results for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 due to an investigation into a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
The company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission in January related to the FCPA investigation, which is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.
Chipotle said it believes the investigation relates to payments made to vendors, including a produce supplier that was previously investigated by the Department of Justice.
As a result of the investigation, Chipotle expects to restate its financial results for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 to reflect non-routine legal and professional fees of around $14 million to $16 million.

I guess this means I'll have to find another spot to grab lunch... again.

Update: Just saw this on CNBC:

""Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill fell more than 4 percent in extended trading Tuesday after the company announced it would restate its financial results for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 due to a federal investigation.""

Yikes! That's not good for business.assistant

Sorry to hear that your favorite lunch spot is going through some tough times!",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
