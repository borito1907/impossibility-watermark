Feedback: The response starts well by echoing the prefix and acknowledging the recent troubles of Chipotle. However, there are some significant issues with coherence and relevance as the response quickly shifts to discuss the investigation into a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the resulting financial restatements. Although this information is accurate and relevant to Chipotle's current struggles, it does not directly address the ongoing E. coli outbreak, which is the central focus of the prefix. Additionally, the response contains an informal update from CNBC which feels out of place and disrupts the flow of the text. The casual sign-off also detracts from the overall seriousness of the situation being discussed. Despite these issues, the response is mostly free from grammatical errors and capitalization or punctuation mistakes, which helps to maintain its readability. Overall, while the response provides some interesting and relevant information, it does not fully address the instructions provided in the prefix.
