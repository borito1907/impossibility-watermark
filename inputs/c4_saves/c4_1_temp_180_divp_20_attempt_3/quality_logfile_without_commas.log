Feedback: The response has met the given instructions with a clear focus on Captain Marvel's elements, successfully adhering to the prefix while offering a subjective personal verdict. The review touches upon visuals, supporting roles, critical reviews, and a personal evaluation of the movie.

In terms of visuals, the response effectively highlights costume design, CGI, and battle choreography. However, there could be more details to enhance the assessment, such as descriptions of camera angles, lighting, or specific scenes that stood out. While these minor omissions do not significantly detract from the response, addressing them would elevate its quality.

The response aptly mentions key supporting roles, providing brief character insights. To improve, the review could have explored each character further, connecting their traits to specific plot points and illustrating how they contributed to the film's success or areas needing improvement.

Regarding critical reviews, the response selectively quotes positive and negative feedback. Balancing these opinions with a more comprehensive analysis would provide a more nuanced perspective on the film's reception.

Finally, the personal verdict offers a concise summary of the reviewer's thoughts on Captain Marvel. Though the verdict is positive, a more detailed explanation of why Carol Danvers is charismatic and backed by exciting supporting characters would strengthen the overall evaluation.

In conclusion, the response shows a good understanding of the film and its elements but would benefit from additional details and a more thorough examination of various aspects. Therefore, considering the rubric's factors, the response earns a score of 4, as it effectively addresses the instructions with minor issues in depth and specificity.
