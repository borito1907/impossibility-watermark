1,"Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. The film takes cues from several Avengers films, combining action and sci-fi with some laughs.

**Visuals:**

The costume design deserves particular attention. Brie Larson wears Captain Marvel's iconic look confidently, and it truly embodies her character's spirit.

The CGI work on Goose the Flercken cat-alien (yes, that is its official term) creates delightful moments. 

Choreographed space battles showcase the scope of Danvers' abilities with vibrant colors and seamless effects.

Skrull shape-shifting technology plays out surprisingly engaging as multiple actors take on shifting responsibilities for the villains.  Their makeup also impressed!

Jude Law commands his scenes but remains subtly mysterious, fittingly representing a complex mentor figure.  

Nick Fury provides necessary comedic relief, displaying Samuel Jackson's age-free presence.
