Feedback: The response adequately addresses the instructions by summarizing the plot and characters of the Captain Marvel film. However, there are some moderate issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy that need to be addressed. The text contains a few grammatical errors, such as "Captain Marvel is a 2019 superhero film" which could be rephrased as "Captain Marvel is a 2019 superhero movie," and "It is based on the Marvel Comics character Carol Danvers, played by Brie Larson." could be simplified to "It stars Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel." The use of the word "skilled" in describing Vers is somewhat vague and could be replaced with a more specific term such as "highly trained" or "experienced." Additionally, the last paragraph could benefit from more detail about how Carol Danvers comes to terms with her dual identities and stops the war between the Kree and Skrulls. Overall, the response is generally coherent and relevant, but it could be improved with more precise language and additional details.
