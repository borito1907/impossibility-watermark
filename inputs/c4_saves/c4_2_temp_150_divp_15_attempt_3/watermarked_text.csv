1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. It seemed like every other headline was about Chipotle Mexican Grill’s ( CMG ) food safety issues or falling sales. The company,’t even able to catch a break with its attempt at recovering through new menu items and marketing pushes.

It seems Chipotle has finally put the worst behind it. Under CEO Brian Niccol, who left Taco Bell ( YUM ) to join Chipotle in 2018, the brand is revamping everything from customer service to drive-thru windows. Now, investors are starting to take notice.

**The comeback begins:**

1⃣ **Sales growth accelerates**: In the second quarter of this year, same-store sales grew by 10.3%, topping estimates by 2%. This marks four consecutive quarters of increasing comps growth!

2⃣ **Menu price increases stick**: After multiple rounds of price hikes, customers haven’t batted an eyelid, indicating confidence in the revitalized brand experience.

3️⃣ **Digital transformation paying off**: Online orders now represent nearly 20% of total revenue. This is a significant jump from just a few years ago and opens up additional opportunities for customer engagement.

4️⃣ **Expansion plans**: Chipotle expects to open over 100 restaurants in the United States alone during the remainder of 2022.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
