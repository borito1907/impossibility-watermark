Feedback: The response effectively addresses the instructions by providing a coherent and creative way to cope with the ongoing troubles at Chipotle through a "Chipotle-less Burrito Bowl Recipe." This idea is relevant and aligns with the prefix given. The ingredients and instructions are clearly listed, making it easy to follow and prepare the dish. However, there are some minor issues in the response that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Firstly, the phrase "fear not, my friends!" feels slightly informal for a response meant to provide helpful information. Secondly, there is a missing comma in the list of ingredients, specifically after "homemade or store-bought" which may cause a momentary pause while reading. These are relatively minor issues, but they slightly detract from the overall coherence and grammatical accuracy of the response.
Score: 4
