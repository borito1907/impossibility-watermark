Chipotle's stock price has fallen about 25% since July, when the company announced it was investigating a norovirus outbreak linked to one of its restaurants in Virginia. Since then, several other outbreaks have been reported across the country.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently investigating at least three foodborne illness outbreaks tied to Chipotle locations in multiple states. The latest outbreak, which began in mid-November, has affected customers in California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington state.
In addition to the CDC investigation, Chipotle is also facing several lawsuits filed by customers who say they were sickened after eating at the chain's restaurants.
On Monday, the company announced that it would temporarily close all of its restaurants nationwide on February 8 for an employee meeting focused on improving food safety protocols. During the meeting, employees will receive additional training on food preparation and handling procedures aimed at reducing the risk of foodborne illness. The closure will last from 10 am to 3 pm local time.
The move comes as part of the company's efforts to regain customer trust and rebuild its brand reputation following the recent outbreaks.
