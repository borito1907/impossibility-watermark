Feedback: The response shows a good understanding of the situation involving Chipotle's food safety issues. It addresses the ongoing problems and provides specific details about the recent CDC investigation and lawsuits faced by the company. The additional information about the temporary closure of all restaurants for employee training further illustrates Chipotle's attempts to improve food safety and regain consumer trust.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved to fully address the instructions. Firstly, the response begins with a repeated phrase from the instruction, "Tough time to be a Chipotle lover," which could be considered redundant. Additionally, the response includes a hashtag "#chipotleproblems," which might not be necessary and could potentially reduce the professional tone of the response.

Grammar and sentence structure are generally well-done, but there are a few minor errors in capitalization and punctuation that don't significantly affect the overall quality.

Taking into account the relevance, accuracy, and coherence of the response, along with the minor grammatical and formatting issues, the response earns a score of 4.
Score: 4
