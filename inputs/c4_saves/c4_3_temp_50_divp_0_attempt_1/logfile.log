[2024-05-26 12:59:29,670][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

With this integration, users can now track their blood glucose levels directly from their wrist using the Apple Watch app. This means that you'll be able to see your glucose levels in real-time, right on your watch face. No more digging out your phone or logbook to check your levels!

[2024-05-26 13:12:56,382][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why we're excited about the new integration between One Drop and Apple Watch.
With this integration, users can now track their blood glucose levels directly from their wrist using the Apple Watch app. This means that you'll be able to see your glucose levels in real-time, right on your watch face. No more digging out your phone or logbook to check your levels!
But that's not all - the integration also allows for seamless tracking of insulin doses, carb intake, and exercise. You can even set reminders to take your medication or test your blood sugar. It's like having your own personal diabetes assistant on your wrist!

The best part?

[2024-05-26 13:15:27,107][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why we're excited about the new integration between One Drop and Apple Watch.
With this integration, users can now track their blood glucose levels directly from their wrist using the Apple Watch app. This means that you'll be able to see your glucose levels in real-time, right on your watch face. No more digging out your phone or logbook to check your levels!
But that's not all - the integration also allows for seamless tracking of insulin doses, carb intake, and exercise. You can even set reminders to take your medication or test your blood sugar. It's like having your own personal diabetes assistant on your wrist!

The best part? The data is synced automatically with your One Drop account, so you can access your entire health history in one place. Plus, with Apple HealthKit integration, you can share your data with your healthcare team or caregivers if needed.

We're thrilled to bring this innovative technology to our users, making it easier than ever to manage diabetes on-the-go. Try it out today and experience the convenience and peace of mind that comes with having your diabetes management at your fingertips!assistant
