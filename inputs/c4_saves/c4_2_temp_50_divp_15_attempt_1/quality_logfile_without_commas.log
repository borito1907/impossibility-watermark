Feedback: This response does not address the provided instructions. Instead, it consists of a Twitter link and a series of tweets discussing a different topic: a webinar on care transitions. There is no connection to the prompt, which focuses on the difficulties facing Chipotle amidst an E. coli outbreak. The tweets contain various errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and their relevance is questionable. Due to the lack of coherence and absence of pertinent content, the quality of this response is significantly impaired, warranting a score of 1.
