Feedback: The response provides a summary of Captain Marvel, but it lacks the detail and coherence required to fully address the instructions. The text begins well, giving an overview of the film's plot and characters. However, it quickly devolves into a list of facts, with little to no context or transition between sentences.

Grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes, such as the missing comma in the first sentence and the incorrect use of possessive form in "Brie Larson's casting," detract from the overall quality of the response. Furthermore, the text seems disjointed, with the final paragraph discussing the trailer and fan reactions, which is not directly related to the preceding paragraph about the film's plot and characters.

While the response does contain relevant information, its relevance is undermined by the aforementioned issues with grammar, coherence, and structure. The response would benefit from additional context, smoother transitions between ideas, and better organization to improve its flow and comprehension.

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 2, as it partially addresses the instructions with notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.
Score: 2
