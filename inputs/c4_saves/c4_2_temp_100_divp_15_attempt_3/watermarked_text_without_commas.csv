1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The company's stock price is plummeting after an E. coli outbreak linked to its food sickened dozens of people in several states, far more than the initial reported number. ""Chipotle Mexican Grill shares sank more than 6% in early trading Tuesday after a report that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified 45 cases of E. coli infections across six states connected to the restaurant chain,"" reports CNN Money.
The CDC says that it has linked Chipotle to the outbreak, which started in October and spread across the country. According to the agency, 43 people have been hospitalized, with five suffering from kidney failure. The outbreak is believed to have originated at a location in Simi Valley, California, but has since spread to other states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, Illinois, Ohio and New York.

Chipotle is now facing multiple lawsuits over the outbreak, as well as calls for increased transparency and accountability in its supply chain.

The outbreak marks the third major food safety incident at Chipotle this year. In August, 234 people were sickened by norovirus at a Chipotle in Simi Valley, California. In September, Chipotle temporarily closed 43 locations in Seattle due to a Salmonella outbreak.

The incidents have raised concerns about the company's food safety protocols and its ability to ensure that its ingredients are safe for consumption.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
