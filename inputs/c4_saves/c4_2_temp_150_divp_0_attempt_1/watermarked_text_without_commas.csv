Anyway, the good news is that Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) sales are expected to recover in Q2 despite all the, you know, drama.
According to Cowen analysts, customer frequency and average transaction value could start recovering by the second quarter as the company implements improvements in food safety, marketing campaigns, and digital investments.

But don‘t count on things getting easier right away. As The Motley Fool puts it, ""the road to recovery for Chipotle won‘t be easy.""
Now might not be the worst time to dip into those tortilla-wrapped savings...
