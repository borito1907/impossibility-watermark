Feedback: The response starts off by connecting the situation at Chipotle to a previous issue with Whole Foods, attempting to draw parallels and establish a common theme. However, this comparison is rather superficial and lacks depth, making it somewhat irrelevant to the main topic of Chipotle's E. coli outbreak and its financial impact. 

The response then moves on to discuss the potential sales recovery for Chipotle, citing Cowen analysts and their predictions for Q2. While the information is relevant, the transition from the initial comparison to this discussion feels abrupt and lacks coherence. Additionally, there is a mixture of tenses, which can be confusing to the reader.

The analysis provided by Cowen is accurate, and the prediction of a sales recovery by Q2 due to improved food safety and digital investments is well-reasoned. However, the tone of the response shifts towards humor ("Now might not be the worst time to dip into those tortilla-wrapped savings...") which, while creative, may not align with the seriousness of the issue being discussed.

In terms of structure, the response is organized but could benefit from clearer transitions and a more consistent tone. The final statement about the US retail sales growth rate appears disconnected from the main discussion about Chipotle, which affects the overall coherence of the response.

Considering these points, the response generally addresses the instructions with moderate issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. Some grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization or punctuation mistakes are present, but they do not severely impact the overall quality. Therefore, the appropriate score for this response is 3.
Score: 3
