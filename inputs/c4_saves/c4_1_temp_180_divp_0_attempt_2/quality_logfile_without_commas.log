Feedback: The response begins by summarizing the premise of Captain Marvel, which aligns with the instructions. However, it quickly deviates into discussing a real-life superhero and Marvel Comics, which is irrelevant to the given instruction. This loss of focus on the main topic affects the coherence of the response.

There are several instances of grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization or punctuation mistakes. For example, the phrase "Here's what a real-life superhero might look like" is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the flow of the text. The repetition of phrases like "Marvel" and "Captain Marvel" without proper context further reduces the quality of the response.

Additionally, the response contains unnecessary information about watching trailers and accessing streaming services, which is not related to the original instruction. The response also lacks accuracy, as it provides incorrect release dates and inaccurate casting details.

In summary, while the response attempts to address the instructions, it suffers from significant issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. These problems detract from the overall quality of the response, which warrants a lower score.
Score: 2
