Feedback: The response generally addresses the instruction by expressing concern about Chipotle's current predicament, considering both the recent E. coli outbreak and the more recent rodent incident. However, there are some issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy that prevent it from receiving a higher score. 

Firstly, the response lacks clarity regarding which specific event the author is referring to when they mention "all the bad press with the customer illness scandal." This ambiguity creates a coherence issue. 

Secondly, the response contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as "I believed was overblown" and "Not even sure if I wanna continue eating at CDM right about now." These errors detract from the overall quality of the response.

Thirdly, while the response is relevant to the instruction, it does not provide any new insights or information about the situation. Instead, it mostly repeats what is already known about Chipotle's struggles with food safety.

Lastly, the response could benefit from a more objective tone. Phrases like "it just looked so bad" and "The video shows rodents scurrying around a Dallas location, which is not only unappetizing but also raises serious questions" could be replaced with more neutral language to improve the accuracy and objectivity of the response.

Overall, the response meets the basic requirements of the instruction but could be improved in terms of grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.
