1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the bad press with the customer illness scandal ( which I believed was overblown) and now this. It s gonna take me some time to forget this... I mean it just looked so bad. Not even sure if I wanna continue eating at CDM right about now. Guess only time will tell....assistant

It's understandable to feel disappointed and concerned when a brand you love faces controversy. The recent video circulating on social media has certainly damaged the reputation of Chipotle,'t want to eat at Chipotle anymore.

The video shows rodents scurrying around a Dallas location, which is not only unappetizing but also raises serious questions about sanitation and quality control. It's reasonable to question how something like this could happen in the first place, especially given Chipotle's previous food safety issues.

Give yourself some time to process your feelings and decide whether or not you're comfortable continuing to support the brand. It's okay to take a break from eating at Chipotle for a while, or to explore other dining options that prioritize cleanliness and quality.

In the meantime, you can keep an eye on how Chipotle responds to this situation. Will they take immediate action to address the issue, increase transparency, and rebuild trust with their customers?",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
