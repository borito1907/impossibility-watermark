Feedback: The response only partially addresses the instructions provided, and there are several notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. The response starts well by summarizing Captain Marvel's plot, but it then deviates from the original prompt by including unrelated information about downloading the movie through torrents and piracy websites. This addition is irrelevant and negatively impacts the coherence and accuracy of the response. Moreover, the response contains grammatical errors and lacks proper capitalization and punctuation, further diminishing its overall quality. Considering these factors, the appropriate score would be a 2.
Score: 2
