1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The whole debacle of the health department shutdowns,’t seem to go away. First it was food safety issues in the supply chain, a year-long rebranding campaign followed and then the unfortunate E. coli outbreak of late November that took multiple franchises out for almost a week’s. Not much comfort in there for potential investors.

However, as they continue with efforts on transparency and sustainability as well as focusing even moreso now it could end up coming into fruiton at long last.

There have recently been significant steps forwarded toward getting more fresh food directly served consumers such has Chipolte partnering with local farmers within certain miles around its restaurants. So, that's not so terrible after all?

On another note the Q4 numbers have finally come in. Chipoltech has made their first positive growth figures reported since 2016’s third quarter. They've shown quarterly profits of nearly $17 million this compares favorableily with -$ 19 milllion just over five years prior.

It will always depend a bit how those efforts will play. We must observe that the company stays true to mission as welll for quality and taste consistency.

Time should allow this turnaround be given its due.
