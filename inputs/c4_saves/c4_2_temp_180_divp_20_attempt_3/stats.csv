To classify these tweets we can do two steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Each text is tokenized in which each message into individual words or characters or words without StopWords such as (is, a, an etc.)

Secondly, **Data cleaning & lemmatization** helps in reducing dimensions of words such as plural and converting all texts into lowercase, thus enhancing overall clarity

We divide our total sample of tweed texts into three categories based on positive neutral

# Step 4: Perform Text Preprocessing on Tweets

Preprocess the data (text preprocessing) by removing stopwords, stemming or lemmatizing, tokenization, lower casing, and punctuation removal.

import nltk tokenizer # Install NLTK Data: import nltk; nltk download ('punkt','stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Example of usage:
result = HateSpeechDetector()
preds_dict = result.infer(batch_sentences_list)
print(preds_dict)    #
```
    
The `infer` function is used with a list of texts as input, the detector will predict each text to one of seven categories ('none', 'generalized hatred', 'anti-lgbt+', 'antisemitism', 'anti-atheist', etc.), and output labels, and return confidence score for each.

In these tweets (where ""t"" stands for shortened 'that' or 'to', and ""@username"" tags a specific user), we can identify negative sentiment towards Chipotle due to their social media mishap:

1. The author implies a sense of betrayal using expressions like ""tough time to be,"" which highlights the severity of the situation.

   writeLinesToFile(lines=labelSet,labelFile=labelPath) 

 &#x20;$&#x20;

   file=open(label_file,&quot;r"") &lt;br=&gt; readDataFromFile(file) \# returns read list  

2 )ReadLabels()

`data_list=get_labels_from_data(tweedpath)

`

Here get all the unique elements from a specified folder for data, each one of them will provide a new output line within file.

Then when I generate input_ids, token_type_ids and attention mask I'll be using

```python


max_lengths=tweet_max_length if hasattr(locals(), ""tweets_max_legnth"")

max_length=128 # Default if tweet maxlen doesnt exists

padding_value= max_length

attentionPaddingToken=tokens_padding[""attentionMask""]
inputs=inputIDs



```



Finally you need just use torch.from to convert everything needed numpy into tensors.

I would categorize these tweets into three topics related to Chipotle and their social media scandal:

**Topic 1:** Outrage and frustration

Examples from dataset:

* Disgusted at for having their Twitter accounts hijacked.
* Don't want my burrito wrapped with hate!
