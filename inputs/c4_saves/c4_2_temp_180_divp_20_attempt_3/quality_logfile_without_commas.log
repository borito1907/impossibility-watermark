Feedback: The response provided appears to be a collection of tweets in response to the ongoing issue with Chipotle. While the tweets touch on the topic and show concern over the E. coli outbreak and the recent Twitter account hack, they do not offer a coherent and creative completion of the given prefix. The tweets are not presented in a clear and organized manner, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative. Additionally, there are numerous grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and repetitions, which negatively impact the response's quality and clarity. Given the inconsistencies and lack of coherence, the response does not meet the standards for a high score, and therefore should be evaluated with a lower score on the rubric.
Score: 2
