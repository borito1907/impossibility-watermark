[2024-05-26 17:28:00,348][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

To classify these tweets we can do two steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Each text is tokenized in which each message into individual words or characters or words without StopWords such as (is, a, an etc.)

Secondly, **Data cleaning & lemmatization** helps in reducing dimensions of words such as plural and converting all texts into lowercase, thus enhancing overall clarity

We divide our total sample of tweed texts into three categories based on positive neutral 
1  Neutral category has mixed feedback of customers where there might not be distinct opinions expressed, examples - * " RT...Watchout...", "*@ News11...".

This solution uses JavaScript higher-order function, arrow functions in lambda form, built-in **includes** method for String instances, **join()** methods & Template Literals. 
We create a filter with **Array.prototype.filter**, the callbacks argument is an Arrow function.

It seems like many of these tweets are referencing an incident where Chipotle's Twitter account was hacked and racist slurs were posted. Many people are upset and criticizing Chipotle for allowing this to happen, while others are poking fun at the embarrassing situation.

1 is positive 
0 is neutral  
-1 is negative 

How can I create the dictionary with words that give us clues to decide if a sentiment is +ve, 0 (neutral), or -ve?

[Dataset Description](Read.txt):
Title: **Chipotle_Hack_Story**

Overview: This dataset comprises of [25 Tweets][https://github.com/mrhrac/Tweets/blob/master/twitter-homework.json] collected online when **@CHIPOTLE**, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.'s verified Twitter handle got HACKED in July 2017.

Data Description: 
- `Chipotle_Hack_Story.csv`: All scraped, relevant English-language tweets about the episode.

}

In these tweets (where "t" stands for shortened 'that' or 'to', and "@username" tags a specific user), we can identify negative sentiment towards Chipotle due to their social media mishap:

1. The author implies a sense of betrayal using expressions like "tough time to be," which highlights the severity of the situation.

	twee_pre_process('./TweetLabel', 'processed_tweet.csv', 'labels.txt', tweet_max_length=280)

```

 

Here some code written using pytorch:

1) Define your tokenizer

 `tokenizer = transformers.BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')`

 

&#x20;if not data.exists(label_path):

&nbsp; &nbsp; label_set=\[] # here add list which holds labels names as strings 

&#x20;$&#x20;"positive",

 &#x20;&nbsp;&quot;negative", &lt;br>&#x20;&lt;/BR&#x3E;    )

 &nbsp; &lsquo;bias&rsquo;

   writeLinesToFile(lines=labelSet,labelFile=labelPath) 

 &#x20;$&#x20;

   file=open(label_file,&quot;r") &lt;br=&gt; readDataFromFile(file) \# returns read list  

2 )ReadLabels()

`data_list=get_labels_from_data(tweedpath)

`

Here get all the unique elements from a specified folder for data, each one of them will provide a new output line within file.

Then when I generate input_ids, token_type_ids and attention mask I'll be using

```python


max_lengths=tweet_max_length if hasattr(locals(), "tweets_max_legnth")

max_length=128 # Default if tweet maxlen doesnt exists

padding_value= max_length

attentionPaddingToken=tokens_padding["attentionMask"]
inputs=inputIDs



```



Finally you need just use torch.from to convert everything needed numpy into tensors.

* Don't want my burrito wrapped with hate!
