Feedback: The response partially addresses the instructions and exhibits some grammatical issues, repetition, and a lack of coherence. The reference to "Mar-Vell" is abrupt and lacks proper context, while the statement "Mar-Vell is dead in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" appears to be unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the text. Additionally, there are several sentences that are fragmented or incomplete, contributing to the overall lack of clarity. The repetition of the term "Mar-Vell" and the disjointed nature of the information provided reduce the relevance and accuracy of the response. However, there is potential for improvement in addressing the given instructions with greater coherence and attention to detail.
