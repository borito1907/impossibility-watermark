1,"When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why we're excited about the new integration between One Drop and Apple Watch! With this integration, you can now seamlessly track your blood glucose levels, insulin doses, and carb intake right from your wrist.

Here are some key features of the integration:

**Track Your Glucose Levels**: View your current glucose reading on your Apple Watch, along with your target range and any alerts or notifications.

**Log Insulin Doses**: Easily log your insulin doses directly from your Apple Watch, including the type, amount, and time taken.

**Count Carbs**: Quickly add up your daily carb intake using the Apple Watch app, making it easier to stay within your recommended range.

**Complications**: Customize your Apple Watch face with complications that display your glucose level, insulin dose, or carb count, giving you quick access to the information you need.

**Workouts and Exercise**: Track your workouts and exercise with Apple Watch, and see how they impact your glucose levels in real-time.

This integration is available for all One Drop users with an Apple Watch Series 1 or later, running watchOS 4 or later. To get started, simply update your One Drop app to the latest version and follow the prompts to connect your Apple Watch.

We hope this integration makes tracking your diabetes even easier and more convenient!assistant
