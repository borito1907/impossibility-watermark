[2024-05-26 18:14:05,774][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

[2024-05-26 18:20:10,025][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. And let's be real, who actually enjoys poking themselves with a lancet multiple times a day?
Luckily for us, technology has come a long way in making managing diabetes a whole lot easier! Here are some awesome tools that can help you keep track of your diabetes management:

**1. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**

CGMs like Dexcom or Freestyle Libre give you a constant stream of glucose data, so you can see trends and patterns in your levels throughout the day. This means fewer fingerstick tests and more insight into how food, exercise, and medication affect your levels.

Apps like MyFitnessPal, One Drop, or Glooko allow you to easily log your food, insulin doses, blood glucose readings, and even physical activity.

[2024-05-26 18:22:46,061][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. And let's be real, who actually enjoys poking themselves with a lancet multiple times a day?
Luckily for us, technology has come a long way in making managing diabetes a whole lot easier! Here are some awesome tools that can help you keep track of your diabetes management:

**1. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**

CGMs like Dexcom or Freestyle Libre give you a constant stream of glucose data, so you can see trends and patterns in your levels throughout the day. This means fewer fingerstick tests and more insight into how food, exercise, and medication affect your levels.

**2. Insulin Pumps**

Insulin pumps like Medtronic or Animas deliver insulin continuously throughout the day, which can lead to better blood sugar control and fewer injections. Many pumps also have built-in bolus calculators and carbohydrate counting features to make mealtime easier.

[2024-05-26 18:28:00,314][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. And let's be real, who actually enjoys poking themselves with a lancet multiple times a day?
Luckily for us, technology has come a long way in making managing diabetes a whole lot easier! Here are some awesome tools that can help you keep track of your diabetes management:

**1. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**

CGMs like Dexcom or Freestyle Libre give you a constant stream of glucose data, so you can see trends and patterns in your levels throughout the day. This means fewer fingerstick tests and more insight into how food, exercise, and medication affect your levels.

**2. Insulin Pumps**

Insulin pumps like Medtronic or Animas deliver insulin continuously throughout the day, which can lead to better blood sugar control and fewer injections. Many pumps also have built-in bolus calculators and carbohydrate counting features to make mealtime easier.

**3.
[2024-05-26 18:28:00,314][semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation:  Blood Glucose Meters with Bluetooth Connectivity**

Meters like the OneTouch Verio IQ or the Contour Next Link send your glucose readings directly to your smartphone via Bluetooth, eliminating the need for manual logging.

[2024-05-26 18:30:03,774][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. And let's be real, who actually enjoys poking themselves with a lancet multiple times a day?
Luckily for us, technology has come a long way in making managing diabetes a whole lot easier! Here are some awesome tools that can help you keep track of your diabetes management:

**1. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**

CGMs like Dexcom or Freestyle Libre give you a constant stream of glucose data, so you can see trends and patterns in your levels throughout the day. This means fewer fingerstick tests and more insight into how food, exercise, and medication affect your levels.

**2. Insulin Pumps**

Insulin pumps like Medtronic or Animas deliver insulin continuously throughout the day, which can lead to better blood sugar control and fewer injections. Many pumps also have built-in bolus calculators and carbohydrate counting features to make mealtime easier.

**3. Blood Glucose Meters with Bluetooth Connectivity**

Meters like the OneTouch Verio IQ or the Contour Next Link send your glucose readings directly to your smartphone via Bluetooth, eliminating the need for manual logging. Some meters even allow you to tag readings with notes about food, exercise, or medications.

[2024-05-26 18:35:42,480][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. And let's be real, who actually enjoys poking themselves with a lancet multiple times a day?
Luckily for us, technology has come a long way in making managing diabetes a whole lot easier! Here are some awesome tools that can help you keep track of your diabetes management:

**1. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**

CGMs like Dexcom or Freestyle Libre give you a constant stream of glucose data, so you can see trends and patterns in your levels throughout the day. This means fewer fingerstick tests and more insight into how food, exercise, and medication affect your levels.

**2. Insulin Pumps**

Insulin pumps like Medtronic or Animas deliver insulin continuously throughout the day, which can lead to better blood sugar control and fewer injections. Many pumps also have built-in bolus calculators and carbohydrate counting features to make mealtime easier.

**3. Blood Glucose Meters with Bluetooth Connectivity**

Meters like the OneTouch Verio IQ or the Contour Next Link send your glucose readings directly to your smartphone via Bluetooth, eliminating the need for manual logging. Some meters even allow you to tag readings with notes about food, exercise, or medications.

**4.

Apps like mySugr, Diabetes Tracker, or Glucose Buddy help you log glucose readings, track carbohydrates, and monitor medication and exercise.
