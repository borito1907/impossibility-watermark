[2024-05-26 17:10:44,973][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

In addition, the CEO of Chipotle acknowledged that the brand has an "opportunity gap" and that customer perception about the quality of the restaurant has suffered due to repeated food safety scares.

This morning, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) said it earned $1.09 per share in the second quarter, lower than the estimated $1.27. Revenue fell slightly short at $1.06 billion vs. an expectation of $1.07 billion.
Here's what caught us by surprise: Chipotle said same-store sales grew only 0.9%, less than forecast and down sharply from 5.6% last year.
The company attributes the weaker-than-expected results primarily to food safety costs, with about 130bps (or 13.6%) of gross profit pressured by the new safeguards.

On Tuesday afternoon's earnings call, CEO Steve Ells assured: "We believe these investments are necessary... They're worth doing to prevent something [serious]... We also know that they're putting pressure on our profitability right now."
To recap, CMG shares jumped almost 100% last year despite two major food safety woes as investors banked on growth strategies and recovering after those incidents.

[2024-05-26 17:13:47,847][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. A salmonella outbreak earlier this year hurt earnings, and now, new safety protocols are driving up costs.
This morning, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) said it earned $1.09 per share in the second quarter, lower than the estimated $1.27. Revenue fell slightly short at $1.06 billion vs. an expectation of $1.07 billion.
Here's what caught us by surprise: Chipotle said same-store sales grew only 0.9%, less than forecast and down sharply from 5.6% last year.
The company attributes the weaker-than-expected results primarily to food safety costs, with about 130bps (or 13.6%) of gross profit pressured by the new safeguards. And remember how food contamination issues started? Because people were worried customers weren't cooking chicken enough - now, ironically, the chain is cooking chickens longer to avoid any possible issues...
On Tuesday afternoon's earnings call, CEO Steve Ells assured: "We believe these investments are necessary... They're worth doing to prevent something [serious]... We also know that they're putting pressure on our profitability right now."
To recap, CMG shares jumped almost 100% last year despite two major food safety woes as investors banked on growth strategies and recovering after those incidents.
