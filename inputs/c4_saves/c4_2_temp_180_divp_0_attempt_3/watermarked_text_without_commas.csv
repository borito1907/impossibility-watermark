1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. A salmonella outbreak earlier this year hurt earnings, and now, new safety protocols are driving up costs.
This morning, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) said it earned $1.09 per share in the second quarter, lower than the estimated $1.27. Revenue fell slightly short at $1.06 billion vs. an expectation of $1.07 billion.
Here's what caught us by surprise: Chipotle said same-store sales grew only 0.9%, less than forecast and down sharply from 5.6% last year.
The company attributes the weaker-than-expected results primarily to food safety costs, with about 130bps (or 13.6%) of gross profit pressured by the new safeguards. And remember how food contamination issues started? Because people were worried customers weren't cooking chicken enough - now, ironically, the chain is cooking chickens longer to avoid any possible issues...
On Tuesday afternoon's earnings call, CEO Steve Ells assured: ""We believe these investments are necessary... They're worth doing to prevent something [serious]... We also know that they're putting pressure on our profitability right now.""
To recap, CMG shares jumped almost 100% last year despite two major food safety woes as investors banked on growth strategies and recovering after those incidents.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
