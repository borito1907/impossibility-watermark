Feedback: The response in question does succeed in completing the provided prefix; however, the completion diverges substantially from the initial content. The introduction of a movie leak reference and the mention of a DC film instead of a Marvel film indicate significant issues with relevance and coherence. Additionally, there are multiple grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization mistakes, such as "Full Movie Leak Online - The piracy giant, TamilRockers, leaked the entire DC film 'Captain Marvel'" and "Captain Marvel reportedly raked in over $700 million during its opening weekend globally," which are not pertinent to the original prompt. Given these concerns, the response scores poorly on both relevance and grammatical correctness, leading to a final score of 2.
Score: 2
