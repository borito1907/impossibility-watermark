1,"When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That’s why technology has come up with ways to monitor blood sugar levels in a more efficient and less pain-free fashion.
Here are a few examples of blood glucose monitoring technologies:
1. Continuous Glucose Monitors: This device is worn on the back of an upper arm and tracks blood glucose levels 24 hours a day for 7 –10 days at a time. The user can see the data real-time, with some systems allowing the information sent via smartphone app, alert their health care team of glucose highs or lows. Some brands that offer this technology are FreeStyle Libre, Dexcom CGM System, and Sensor OncceCGMs.
2. Smartphone accessories: These devices turn your smartphone into blood glucose monitors. One example is GlucoPulse which measures heart rate and oxygenation also.
3 Non-invasive testing: No pin-priking finger blood glucose! Devices such as Integrity Apps employ sensors within a mobile device or band to measure glucose through sweat and breath while some use electromagnetic waves from saliva. (More about noninvasive tests below).
Some digital therapeutics like the digital Twin by Inceptuo can even help with nutrition & exercise planning & support for diabetic management.
