Feedback: The response does provide information on Captain Marvel, addressing the provided instruction. However, there are a few issues regarding coherence and accuracy that detract from its quality. 

Firstly, the response jumps directly into the film's reception and the announcement of a sequel without setting the context or introducing the main characters. This lack of context can make it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the topic to understand the significance of the information presented.

Secondly, while the response mentions the directors and the composer, it fails to mention the all-star cast or Larson's excitement for the role, which were key aspects of the original instruction. Moreover, the response states that the film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet contributing to the screenplay, but it omits the fact that other writers were also involved in the film's production.

Lastly, the response introduces a short film and music related to Captain Marvel, which is not directly relevant to the provided instruction. This additional information, while interesting, distracts from the main focus and may confuse readers.

Overall, while the response does provide some accurate information, its lack of coherence, omission of key details, and inclusion of irrelevant information result in a lower score.
Score: 3
