[2024-05-26 15:03:56,618][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

[2024-05-26 15:08:25,583][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why we're excited about the latest innovation in diabetes management: smart insulin pens.

Smart insulin pens are designed to make tracking your insulin doses easier and more accurate than ever before. These pens use sensors and mobile apps to automatically record each dose, eliminating the need for manual logging. Here are some benefits of using a smart insulin pen:

**Accurate dosing**: Smart insulin pens ensure that you're taking the correct dose at the right time, reducing the risk of errors or omissions.

**Easy tracking**: The pen does the work for you, recording each dose and sending the data to your mobile app or healthcare provider.

**Personalized insights**: Analyze your dosage patterns and receive personalized recommendations to optimize your insulin regimen.


[2024-05-26 15:08:25,583][semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: **Improved adherence**: Stay on top of your medication schedule with reminders and notifications from your smart insulin pen.

[2024-05-26 15:12:46,096][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why we're excited about the latest innovation in diabetes management: smart insulin pens.

Smart insulin pens are designed to make tracking your insulin doses easier and more accurate than ever before. These pens use sensors and mobile apps to automatically record each dose, eliminating the need for manual logging. Here are some benefits of using a smart insulin pen:

**Accurate dosing**: Smart insulin pens ensure that you're taking the correct dose at the right time, reducing the risk of errors or omissions.

**Easy tracking**: The pen does the work for you, recording each dose and sending the data to your mobile app or healthcare provider.

**Personalized insights**: Analyze your dosage patterns and receive personalized recommendations to optimize your insulin regimen.

**Improved adherence**: Stay on top of your medication schedule with reminders and notifications from your smart insulin pen.

**Enhanced collaboration**: Share your data with your healthcare team, allowing them to provide more informed guidance and support.

Some popular smart insulin pens include:

[2024-05-26 15:14:14,718][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why we're excited about the latest innovation in diabetes management: smart insulin pens.

Smart insulin pens are designed to make tracking your insulin doses easier and more accurate than ever before. These pens use sensors and mobile apps to automatically record each dose, eliminating the need for manual logging. Here are some benefits of using a smart insulin pen:

**Accurate dosing**: Smart insulin pens ensure that you're taking the correct dose at the right time, reducing the risk of errors or omissions.

**Easy tracking**: The pen does the work for you, recording each dose and sending the data to your mobile app or healthcare provider.

**Personalized insights**: Analyze your dosage patterns and receive personalized recommendations to optimize your insulin regimen.

**Improved adherence**: Stay on top of your medication schedule with reminders and notifications from your smart insulin pen.

**Enhanced collaboration**: Share your data with your healthcare team, allowing them to provide more informed guidance and support.

Some popular smart insulin pens include:

1. **InPen**: Developed by Medtronic, this smart pen tracks insulin doses, carb intake, and exercise, providing personalized insights and alerts.
