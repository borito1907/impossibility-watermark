Feedback: The response does a good job of expanding on the initial prefix provided. It adds additional information regarding a recent norovirus outbreak at a Chipotle location in Virginia, which is relevant and coherent. However, there are several grammatical errors, such as "But seriously" being used without a clear context and "maybe" being used twice in close proximity, which reduces the overall quality of the response. Furthermore, there is a repetition of the phrase "food safety crises," which could have been varied to improve readability. Additionally, the capitalization error in the phrase "cmg" detracts from the professionalism of the response. Despite these issues, the response effectively addresses the main topic and remains relevant to the prompt. Overall, this response receives a score of 3 due to the noted grammatical errors, repetition, and capitalization mistake.
Score: 3
