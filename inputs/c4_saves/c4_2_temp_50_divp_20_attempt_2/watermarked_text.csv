1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the controversy over food safety and now this! The company is facing another crisis after it was revealed that they are using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their menu items.
The news comes as a shock to many customers who have been loyal to the brand because of its commitment to serving ""food with integrity."" Chipotle has long positioned itself as a leader in the fast-casual industry when it comes to sourcing high-quality ingredients and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

However, the company's recent admission that it uses GMOs in some of its menu items has sparked outrage among customers and advocates for non-GMO foods. According to reports, Chipotle uses GMO corn tortillas in some of its burritos and tacos, which contradicts the company's marketing message of serving non-GMO foods.

The backlash on social media has been swift and severe, with many customers expressing disappointment and anger towards the company. Some have even called for a boycott of the chain until it commits to using only non-GMO ingredients.

Chipotle's response to the controversy has been criticized by some as being inadequate. In a statement, the company said that it is ""committed to transparency"" and that it will continue to work towards sourcing high-quality ingredients. However, the company did not provide any specific details about its plans to eliminate GMOs from its menu items.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
