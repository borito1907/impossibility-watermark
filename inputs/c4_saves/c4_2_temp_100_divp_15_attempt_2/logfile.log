[2024-05-26 14:47:13,479][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

[2024-05-26 14:51:58,970][semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: By ERICA ORDEN and AARON KATERSKY, ABC News(WASHINGTON) -- Two more men have been arrested in connection with the alleged ISIS-inspired bombings that rocked New York City last month, federal authorities said Monday.Waheyd Allah-Moore, 34, of Jersey City, N.J., was taken into custody Sunday night, while Omar Ali, 27, of East Orange, N.J., was arrested earlier Monday, according to the FBI.Allah-Moore is accused of providing material support to the bombing suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, who allegedly set off explosives in Seaside Park, N.J., and Chelsea, Manhattan on Sept. 17.Rahami, 28, was captured after a shootout with police in Linden, N.J. on Sept. 19, and has since been charged with using weapons of mass destruction in the United States.The new arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, which so far has resulted in five people being charged in connection with the bombing plot, including Rahami's brother, Nasim Rahami, and two other men from New Jersey.Authorities say the suspects were inspired by ISIS and sought to carry out terrorist attacks in the name of the extremist group.assistant

Two more individuals, Waheyd Allah-Moore (34) and Omar Ali (27), have been arrested in connection with the ISIS-inspired bombings that occurred in New York City last month. Allah-Moore is accused of providing material support to the main bombing suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, who allegedly detonated explosives in New Jersey and Manhattan on September 17.
