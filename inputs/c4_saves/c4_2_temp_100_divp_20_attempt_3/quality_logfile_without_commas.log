Feedback: This response effectively expands upon the initial instruction by discussing additional challenges faced by Chipotle, including a subpoena from the SEC and customer concerns about price increases. The response maintains a relevant focus on Chipotle's difficulties and even invites further discussion from the reader. Although the response could have been more directly tied to the initial text concerning the E. coli outbreak, it remains coherent and provides new information that adds context to Chipotle's current struggles. However, some minor grammatical errors and informal language slightly detract from its overall quality.
