1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The stock has been pummeled lately due to concerns about the company's ability to bounce back from food safety issues. Today,'the news isn't any better.  company revealed that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to the marketing and financial performance data for its chorizo product launch.

The news sent shares plummeting more than 5% in early trading. That's on top of an already rough year for the stock, which is down around 25% YTD.

This latest development only adds to the list of headaches for the burrito chain. From customer complaints about rising prices to lingering concerns over food safety, Chipotle has struggled to regain investor confidence.

As you know, I'm always looking out for opportunities to buy quality companies at discounted prices. But with this latest news, even I think it might be too soon to start buying up Chipotle shares.

What do you think, though? Is it time to start nibbling on some CMG or should investors continue to exercise caution?
