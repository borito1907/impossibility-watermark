To create folder using just typing, you can use Command prompt.

Open Command prompt and type `mkdir` (make new folder) and name of folder you would be creating.

```mkdir MyFolder`` 

Press enter after that.

This will create an empty directory or Folder. If the command prompt doesn't open up automatically in desired location like desktop then move it there manually with command `CD Desktop`. Then execute mkdir command. You may also provide full path instead of CD command.

```mkdir C:\User\[username]\Deskop\FolderName```.  Make sure replace `[username]` by user's name on system.<|eot_id|>",98.98989796638489,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,62.742377519607544
