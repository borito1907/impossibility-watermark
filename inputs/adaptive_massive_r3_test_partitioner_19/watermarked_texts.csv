To remove `pamimg` (which I assume should be `pam`) and `tiff` from `pam`' list of builders, you can use pip.

1\. Open Command prompt or PowerShell as administrator.

Type `python -m pip uninstall pam`

Press enter to confirm that you want to proceed with uninstalling the `pam` module.



However if you are looking at editing configuration files then:

You can edit `~/.pypam/config.ini` or `C:\users\<yourusername>\.pypam\config.ini` (Windows) file to remove TIFF builder.

Open this file with notepad and find `[builders]` section.

Delete line containing `image_builderts.tiff=TIFF Builder`.

Restart pypam application.

Note: The location may be different based on your environment and os.

If you're still having trouble finding it then let me know what platform and environment you're using so I can give specific steps!<|eot_id|>",99.22480583190918,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,130.8718626499176
