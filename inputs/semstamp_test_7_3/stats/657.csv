56,"Here's an outline of the proof:

**Step 1: Show that the sum is bounded below by the logarithmic integral**

Recall the definition of the logarithmic integral function:

$$Li(x) = \int_2^x \frac{dt}{\ln t}$$

Using integration by parts, with $u = 1/\ln t$ and $dv = dt$, we get:

$$Li(x) = \frac{x}{\ln x} - \frac{2}{\ln 2} + \int_2^x \frac{dt}{(\ln t)^2}$$

Since the integral term is positive, we have:

$$Li(x) > \frac{x}{\ln x} - \frac{2}{\ln 2}$$
