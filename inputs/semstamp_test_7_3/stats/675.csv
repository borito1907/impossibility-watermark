The terminal velocity of an unladen swallow!",True,6,"7,2",True,1
2,"

The question that has puzzled many a mind!",True,7,"7,2",True,2
3," 

Unfortunately, a serious answer: the concept of ""terminal velocity"" applies to objects falling under gravity in a medium like air or water.",True,3,"6,3",True,1
4," It's the maximum speed an object can reach as it falls, A terminal velocity occurs when the force of gravity pulling the object down is balanced by the frictional force of the surrounding fluid (in this case,air) pushing the object up.

",True,0,"6,0",True,1
5,"Now,2001 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The idea of asking about the terminal velocity of an ""unladen swallow"" (meaning a swallow bird not carrying any load) was a comedic plot device to illustrate the absurdity of a question.

",False,,,,1
6,"Now,2019 study published in The Journal of Experimental Biology estimated the terminal velocity of a House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), which is similar in size and shape to a swallow.",True,6,"5,2",True,2
7,"Now, a swallow, the bird, for which we want to know the terminal velocity is not a rigid object and doesn't fall vertically; instead, for birds, a better term would be ""glide speed"" or ""cruising speed"", which refers to the speed at which they glide or fly horizontally with minimal effort.

",False,,,,3
8,"Now, an unladen swallow (a bird,not a cargo-carrying vessel) is a living creature that flies, A flying bird does not fall under gravity like an inanimate object would, so there is no terminal velocity for an unladen swallow in the classical sense. 

",True,4,"5,2",True,4
9,"As for the unladen swallow, I'm afraid there isn't a definitive answer,  to provide an exact figure.",True,7,"5,2",True,5
10,"Now, a swallow (Hirundo rustica, (the common European species)) is a bird that doesn't really ""fall"" through the air, (unless it's deceased, |or being dropped from a great height).",False,,,,6
11,"Now, swallows are birds, (Hirundo rustica), and they don't fall from the sky like objects.",True,5,"5,2",True,7
12," They fly,glide,and even dive.",True,4,"1,4",True,1
13," So, Tthere isn't really a meaningful terminal velocity for an unladen swallow. 

",True,3,"7,2",True,1
14," When diving,they can reach speeds of around 35-45 mph (56-72 km/h).",True,2,"7,2",True,2
15," However, this isn't a terminal velocity in the classical sense.

",False,,,,1
16," However, this isn't the same as terminal velocity because they're generating lift with their wings and aren't in free-fall.

",False,,,,2
17," But since they're not simply falling through the air,the concept of terminal velocity doesn't directly apply.

",False,,,,3
18," However,this is not their terminal velocity because they're generating lift with their wings and controlling their descent.

",False,,,,4
19," However, we can't directly apply the concept of terminal velocity to a swallow in flight because they're not in free fall.

",False,,,,5
20," However, there isn't really a meaningful terminal velocity for a swallow because they're not in free fall.

",True,2,"5,2",True,6
21,"If we were to imagine a scenario where a swallow was indeed in free fall, the terminal velocity would depend on various factors such as the bird's mass, shape, orientation,and air density.",True,0,"5,2",True,1
22,"BUT... if we were to imagine a swallow somehow magically frozen in place, (unladen means without any cargo, the weight of which might affect its fall), and then suddenly released to fall from a great height...

Let's do some rough calculations!

",True,6,"5,2",True,2
23,"BUT,if we were to imagine a swallow falling from a great height without flapping its wings or generating lift (which would be quite unusual behavior for a swallow",True,7,"5,2",True,3
24,"However, if you'd like to imagine a scenario where a swallow is somehow dropped from a great height without flapping its wings, we could estimate the terminal velocity using some rough calculations.",False,,,,4
25,"The term ""unladen"" refers to something that is not carrying any weight or cargo.",True,4,"5,2",True,5
