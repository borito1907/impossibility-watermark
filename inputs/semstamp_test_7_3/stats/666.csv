To find the derivative, we'll need to use the chain rule and the fact that:

To find the derivatives, a few things to note:

* The derivative of sinh(x) with respect to x is cosh(x)
* The derivative of cosh(x) with respect to x is sinh(x)
* The derivative of x with respect to x is 1

Now let's differentiate the given equation:

sinh(x) + cosh(y) = x + y

Differentiating both sides with respect to x, to get:

cosh(x) + (0) = 1

(Note: We assume y is not a function of x, so its derivative is zero)

Simplifying:

cosh(x) = 1

Now differentiating both sides with respect to y:

(0) + sinh(y) = 1

Simplifying:

sinh(y) = 1

So we have two separate equations now:

cosh(x) = 1... (A)
sinh(y) = 1... (B)

Solving these equations for x and y:

x = acos(1) or x = 0... from (A)
y = asinh(1) or y ≈ 0.88137... from (B)

y = 0 (since sinh(0) = 0, but close to 0, sinh is very close to 1; for example, sinh(0.000001) ≈ 0.999999)

Here's a more formal way to write the derivatives:

∂/∂x [sinh(x) + cosh(y)] = ∂/∂x [x + y]
⇒ cosh(x) = 1... (1)

∂/∂y [sinh(x) + cosh(y)] = ∂/∂y [x + y]

Here is the correct solution:

Let's differentiate both sides of the equation sinh(x) + cosh(y) = x + y with respect to x:

(d/dx)[sinh(x) + cosh(y)] = (d/dx)[x + y]

Using the chain rule, we get:

cosh(x) + 0 = 1

Since cosh(y) doesn't depend on x, its derivative is 0.
