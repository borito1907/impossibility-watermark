A nice hyperbolic trigonometry problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

We're given:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x + 1

Now, let's find the derivatives of each term using the chain rule and the fact that d/dx (sinh(u)) = cosh(u) \* du/dx and d/dx (cosh(u)) = sinh(u) \* du/dx:

d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)
d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

So, the left-hand side becomes:

cosh(x) + sinh(x)

**Given equation:** sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x + 1

**Derivative:**

Using the chain rule, product rule, and the facts that:
- The derivative of sinh(u) is cosh(u) \* u'

A hyperbolic function question!

Let's break it down:

We have: sinh(x) + cosh(x) =?

To find the derivative, (with respect to x), we'll use the chain rule and the fact that the derivatives of sinh(x) and cosh(x) are:

* d(sinh(x))/dx = cosh(x)
* d(cosh(x))/dx = sinh(x)

So, a(x) = sinh(x) => a'(x) = cosh(x)
b(x) = cosh(x) => b'(x) = sinh(x)

Now, take the derivative of both sides:

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (?)

A hyperbolic function question!

Let's break it down:

We have:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) =?

To find the derivative, in this case, to simplify things, there is a trick we can use: 

Recall that sinh(x) and cosh(x) can be expressed as exponentials:

sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2 
cosh(x) = (e^x + e^{-x})/2 

Now,'take the derivative of both sides:

d/dx [sinh(x) + cosh(x)] = d/dx[e^x]

Using the chain rule, power rule,sum rule,'the derivatives are:

(e^x - e^{-x})/2 + (e^x + e^{-x})/2 = e^x 

Simplifying,'we get:

e^x + e^x - e^{-x} + e^{-x}/2 + 2/2 = e^x 

Combine like terms:

(2e^x)/1 + (-2e^{-x})/2 + (2e^{-x})/2 = e^x 

Simplify further:

2e^x - 0 = e^x 

Divide by 2:

e^x = e^x 

So our final answer is:

derivative of sinh(x) + cosh(x) = e^x

We are given:
sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1

To find the derivative, we'll apply the chain rule and the sum rule:

Derivative of sinh(x):
d(sinh(x))/dx = cosh(x)

Derivative of cosh(x):
d(cosh(x))/dx = sinh(x)

Now, let's differentiate both sides of the equation:

d(sinh(x))/dx + d(cosh(x))/dx = d(2x)/dx + d(1)/dx

Substituting the derivatives:

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2 + 0

So, the derivative is:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2assistant

To find the derivative, to both sides with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule and the derivatives of sinh(x) and cosh(x):

**Derivative of sinh(x):** d(sinh(x))/dx = cosh(x)

**Derivative:**

Using the chain rule and the fact that:

* d(cosh(u))/dx = sinh(u) \* du/dx (since d(cosh(t))/dt = sinh(t))
