Birds of Mars, they whisper low,
In dialects only winds may know,
Their songs, like aurora's glow,
Echoes through the rusty woe,

With eyes like rubies, red and bright,
They scan the dunes, day and night,
In search of worms that burrow deep,
Or water streams that seep,

No trees to perch upon, no shade,
Just dust devils dancing, made,
From Cydonia's hills to Olympus' height,
The Martian skies, a lonely sight,

Yet still, these winged creatures thrive,
Adapted, resilient, alive,
Their rust-red plumage, wind-whipped bright,
A beacon hope, in Mars' cold light,

Perhaps one day, when humans come,
To settle, toil, and make their home,
These Martian birds will join the throng,
And sing their songs, all morning long.
