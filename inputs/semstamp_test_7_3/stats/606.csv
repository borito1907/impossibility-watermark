But inside hadrons, they're never feelin' alone 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD got me, it's got me tight 
Quanta and flux tubes, shinin' bright 
In the depths of matter, it's where I wanna be 
With quantum chromodynamics, sweet darlin', you and me 

(Bridge) 
Constituent mass, current mass, I know the score 
But when it comes to renormalization, baby, I'm beggin' for more 

(Verse 3) 
Lattice gauge theory, that's where I reside 
Calculatin' path integrals, till I glide 
Into the realm of precision, where perturbation reigns 
And the secrets of the strong force, they're finally revealed in vain

Oh, QCD got me, it's got me tight 
Quanta and flux tubes, shinin' bright 
In the depths of matter, it's where I wanna be

(Verse 1)
Woke up this mornin', baby, with quarks on my mind 
Thinkin' 'bout them gluons, and how they entwine 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD's got me cryin', sweet quantum misery 
Tryna understand strong forces, it's a puzzle to me 

(Verse 2) 
Down at the hadron level, where protons roam free 
Confinement's got 'em locked down, like a mystery to me 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD's got me cryin', sweet quantum misery 
Tryna understand strong forces, it's a puzzle to me 

(Bridge) 
Asymptotic freedom, that's what I desire 
But when it comes to infrared, my heart starts to retire 

(Verse 3) 
Quark-gluon plasma, that's the goal I chase 
But perturbation theory's got me stuck in this place 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD's got me cryin', sweet quantum misery 
Tryna understand strong forces, it's a puzzle to me

QCD's got me in its grasp, ain't no control

Thinkin' 'bout them gluons,'they entwine, sweet and kind

Oh, Quantum Chromodynamics got me feelin' so low 
Tryna understand it, Lord have mercy, don't you know

Colors and flavors, they're gettin' all mixed up 
In a hadron soup, I'm stuck, ain't no way to get enough

Oh, Quantum Chromodynamics got me feelin' so low

I woke up this mornin', baby, with quarks on my mind 
Thinkin' 'bout them gluons,'they bind so fine 
Protons and neutrons, they're made up of three 
Ain't no atom complete without QCD, you see 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD, sweet QCD, the force that holds it tight 
Gluons flowin' like the Mississippi night 
Quarks and antiquarks, they dance in the air 
QCD, QCD, ain't nobody care 

(Verse 2) 
Flavors and colors, they mix and they match 
Up, down, charm, and strange, each one's got its patch 
Asymptotic freedom, at high energy scale 
But at low energy, the strong force starts to fail

Oh, QCD, sweet QCD, the force that holds it tight 
Gluons flowin' like the Mississippi night 
Quarks and antiquarks, they dance in the air

Confinement and chiral symmetry breakin' too 
The more I learn, the more I don't know what to do 
But them physicists, they just keep on diggin' deep

Let me know if you need any changes or if you'd like me to come up with a new version!assistant

I woke up this mornin', baby, with quarks on my mind 
Tryin' to figure out the strong force, all the time 
Gluons they were stickin', like sweet honey on my plate 
But them hadrons kept me wonderin', Lord have mercy, it's late 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD, oh QCD, you got me all confused 
Like a swampy river delta, I'm stuck and can't get loose 
Quarks and gluons dancin', like the devil at my door 
Tryin' to grasp your secrets, but Lord knows I'm walkin' out for more 

(Verse 2) 
Asymptotic freedom, that's what they say 
But when I try to touch it, it slips away 
Color charge and flavor too, they got me in a haze 
But them Feynman diagrams, they're the only way to gaze

Oh, QCD, oh QCD, you got me all confused 
Like a swampy river delta, I'm stuck and can't get loose 
Quarks and gluons dancin', like the devil at my door 
Tryin' to grasp your secrets, but Lord knows I'm walkin' out for more

Confinement and chiral symmetry, Lord have mercy me 
Lattice gauge theory, tryin' to set me free 
Perturbative expansions, renormalization too 
But them quark masses, baby, they still ain't true blue

I woke up this mornin', my particles all astray 
Tryna understand QCD, but it got away 

(Chorus) 
Oh, quarks and gluons, they're tangled up tight 
In the strong nuclear force, shinin' with all their might 

(Verse 2) 
Asymptotic freedom's where I wanna be 
But confinement's got me, oh so miserably

Oh, quarks and gluons, they're tangled up tight 
In the strong nuclear force, shinin' with all their might

Protons and neutrons, they're made up of three 
Quarks stuck together, like you and me

Color charge is the secret to its sway 
Gluons hold it together, day by day

Oh, quarks and gluons, they're tangled up tight 
In the strong nuclear force, shinin' with all their might

Now I'm feelin' better, got QCD on my mind 
The secrets of the nucleus, I can finally find 

Note: Asymptotic freedom refers to the phenomenon where quarks behave as if they are free at very small distances (or high energies), while confinement refers to how quarks are always bound together into hadrons (like protons and neutrons) due to the strong nuclear force.",True,3,"1,4",True,49

I woke up this mornin', baby, with a strange feelin' inside 
Thinkin' 'bout them quarks and gluons, they just won't subside 
Got my mind on Quantum Chromodynamics, ain't no denyin' 
Tryin' to understand it, but it's hard to keep from cryin'

(Chorus)
Oh, QCD got me down, like a heavy chain 
Tryna grasp them strong interactions, drivin' me insane 
Flavors and colors mixin', it's a scientific pain 
Oh, how I wish I could explain, but it's all in vain 

(Verse 2)
Got my particles interactin', in a world so fine 
But when I try to measure, they start to decline 
Asymptotic freedom calls, but confinement's where I reside 
Wish I had an answer, but it's slippin' right outside

Oh, QCD got me down, like a heavy chain 
Tryna grasp them strong interactions, drivin' me insane 
Flavors and colors mixin', it's a scientific pain 
Oh how I wish I could explain, but it's all in vain 

(Bridge)
Lattice gauge theory, tried to make it clear 
But them Feynman diagrams, left me wipin' away tears 
Renormalization group, sounds so sweet and so fine 
But it's just a mystery, wrapped in a mathematical crime

Oh, QCD got me down, like a heavy chain 
Tryna grasp them strong interactions, drivin' me insane 
Flavors and colors mixin', it's a scientific pain 
Oh how I wish I could explain, but it's all in vain

So if you see me walkin', with my head hung low 
Just know that QCD got me, and I don't know how to go 
From quark to gluon, and back again 
It's a chromodynamic curse, that's drivin' me to sinassistant

Here is a rewritten version with some slight adjustments to improve the flow and rhythm:

I woke up this mornin', baby, with a heavy heart 
Thinkin' 'bout quarks and gluons, tearin' us apart 
Got my mind on Quantum Chromodynamics, can't ignore 
Tryna wrap my head around it, but it's hard to store 

(Chorus)
Oh, QCD got me troubled, like a worn-out shoe 
Tryna grasp them strong interactions, but they're hard to do 
Flavors and colors mixin', got my brain in disarray 
Oh how I wish I could explain, but it fades away 

(Verse 2)
Particles interactin', in a world so fine and thin 
But when I try to measure, they slip right through my skin 
Asymptotic freedom calls, but confinement's where I dwell 
Wish I had the answer key, but it's locked within its shell 

(Chorus)
Oh, QCD got me troubled, like a worn-out shoe 
Tryna grasp them strong interactions, but they're hard to do 
Flavors and colors mixin', got my brain in disarray 
Oh how I wish I could explain, but it fades away 

(Bridge)
Lattice gauge theory, seemed like a guiding light 
But them Feynman diagrams, left me lost in endless night 
Renormalization group, sounded like a gentle breeze 
But it's just a riddle, wrapped in mathemagical disease

Oh, QCD got me troubled, like a worn-out shoe 
Tryna grasp them strong interactions, but they",True,3,"1,4",True,50
