* Physical interpretation: totally symmetric with respect to all operations of Td

**E (2-dimensional)**:

* Character: χ(g) = 2 for rotations by π about axes joining opposite edges; χ(g) = -1 for reflections through planes perpendicular to those axes; χ(g) = 0 otherwise 
* Basis functions: doubly degenerate functions transforming like x, y or xy, x^2-y^2 (e.g., px, py orbitals)
* Physical interpretation: doubly degenerate states, which might split under external perturbations

* Character: χ(g) = 3 for identity operation E; χ(g) = -1 for rotations by 2π/3 about axes joining vertices to face centroids; χ(g) = 0 otherwise 
* Basis functions: triply degenerate functions transforming like x, y, z or xyz (e.g., d-orbitals)
