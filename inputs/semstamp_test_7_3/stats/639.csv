So,

Now, let's calculate the time it would take to cover this distance at a speed of 110 km/h:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 40,140,400,000 km / 110 km/h

To make the calculation easier, let's convert the speed from km/h to km/s:
110 km/h = 30.56 km/s (approximately)

Now, plug in the values:

Time = 40,140,400,000 km / 30.56 km/s

4.24 light-years × 9,460,000,000,000 km/light-year ≈ 40,123,200,000,000 km

Now, let's calculate the time:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 40,123,200,000,000 km / 110 km/h

To make the calculation more manageable, let's convert the speed from km/h to km/s:
