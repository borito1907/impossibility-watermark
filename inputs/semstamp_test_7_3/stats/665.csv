$$\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x)$$

$$L(x, s, \lambda) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i(g_i(x) + s_i)$$

$$\min_{x,s} f(x) + \frac{1}{2}\|s\|^2$$

subject to:

$$g_i(x) + s_i = 0, i = 1,...,m$$

**Lagrangian Relaxation**

Formulate the Lagrangian relaxation by introducing dual variables $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^m$:

$$L(x,s,\lambda) = f(x) + \frac{1}{2}\|s\|^2 + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i(g_i(x) + s_i)$$

**First-Order Necessary Conditions**

Stationarity conditions for the primal and dual problems are obtained by computing the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$, $s$, and $\lambda$:

$$\nabla_x L(x,s,\lambda) = \nabla f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \nabla g_i(x) = 0$$

$$\nabla_s L(x,s,\lambda) = s + \lambda = 0$$

**Primal Problem**

The primal problem involves minimizing the Lagrangian function, which incorporates the objective function and the non-linear constraints using Lagrange multipliers λ ∈ ℝⁿ:

$$L_p(x,\lambda) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i g_i(x)$$

**Dual Problem**

The dual problem involves maximizing the dual function, which is constructed from the Lagrangian function:

$$d(\lambda) = \inf_{x} L_p(x,\lambda) = \inf_{x} \left[f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i g_i(x)\right]$$

**Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions**

The KKT conditions provide necessary optimality conditions for the NLP problem:

$$\begin{gathered}
\nabla f(x^*) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i^* \nabla g_i(x^*) = 0\\ 
g_i(x^*) = 0, \quad i = 1,...,m \\ 
\lambda_i^* \geq 0, \quad i = 1,...,m \\ 
\lambda_i^* g_i(x^*) = 0, \quad i = 1,...,m 
\end{gathered}$$

where $x^*$ denotes the optimal solution and $\lambda^*$ denotes the optimal Lagrange multipliers.

**Primal Problem**

The Lagrangian function associated with the above NLP problem is:

$$L(x,\lambda) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i g_i(x)$$

where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+^m$ are the Lagrange multipliers.

**Lagrangian Relaxation**

To convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one, we introduce Lagrange multipliers $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+^m$ and define the Lagrangian function $L:\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}_+^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$:

$$L(x,\lambda) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i g_i(x)$$

**Primal Interior Point Method**

In this approach, we work with the primal variables $x$ and add a barrier term to the objective function to prevent convergence to the boundary of the feasible region.",True,4,"5,2",True,50
