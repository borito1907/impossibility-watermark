Let's break down the given expression step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**

* 6%4 = 6 modulo 4 = 2 (because 6 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2)

So, the expression becomes:
2*9*(2)+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 2: Multiply 2 and 9**

* 2*9 = 18

The expression now looks like this:
18*(2)+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 3: Multiply 18 and 2**

* 18*(2) = 36

The expression simplifies to:
36+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 4: Divide 4000 by 56**

* 4000/56 = 71.43 (approx.)
