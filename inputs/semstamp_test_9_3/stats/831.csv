**The Squeeze Theorem**: 

Suppose we have three functions: f(x), g(x), and h(x).",True,5,"6,3",True,2
55,"Here's how it works:

**The Squeeze Theorem Statement:**

If there exist three functions f(x), g(x), and h(x) such that:

1. g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x) for all x in an open interval containing c (except possibly at x=c)
2. lim (x→c) g(x) = lim (x→c) h(x) = L

Then, we can conclude that:

lim (x→c) f(x) = L

In simpler terms, if a function f(x) is ""squeezed"" between two other functions g(x) and h(x) that both approach the same limit L as x approaches c, to get that limit for f(x).

60,This theorem is incredibly useful when dealing with tricky limits or functions that are hard to work with directly.,True,5,"6,0",True,5
61,"Think of it like this: Imagine you're trying to determine the limit of a function f(x) as x gets arbitrarily close to some value c. If you have two other functions, be below and above f(x), respectively and they both converge to the same limit L as x approaches c. Then, other must also converge to L.

This theorem is incredibly useful in finding limits that might be tricky to evaluate directly, to avoid messy calculations or when dealing with complex functions.assistant
