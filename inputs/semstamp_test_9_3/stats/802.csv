So, the final answer is: 0assistant

Let me break it down step by step:


1 + 6/3 = 1 + 2 = 3 (since 6 divided by 3 is 2)

3 - 8*2 = 3 - 16 = -13 (since 8 multiplied by 2 is 16)

-13 + 4 = -9 

-9 - 2/2 = -9 - 1 = -10 (since 2 divided by 2 is 1)

-10 + 4 = -6 

-6 + 8 = 2 

2 - 2 = 0 

So, the final answer is indeed: **0**assistant
