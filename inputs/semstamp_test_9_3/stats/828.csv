To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of moles of NaOH and then determine the volume of H2SO4 required to react with it.

",True,2,"5,2",True,17
18,"First, let's calculate the number of moles of NaOH:

Molarity of NaOH = 0.101 M (given)
Volume of NaOH = 40.3 mL = 40.3/1000 = 0.0403 L ( converted to liters)

Number of moles of NaOH = Molarity x Volume (in liters)
= 0.101 M x 0.0403 L 
= 0.01023 mol 

The balanced equation for the reaction between H2SO4 and NaOH is:

H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

From the equation, we can see that 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH.",False,,,,1
19,"First, let's find the number of moles of NaOH:

Moles of NaOH = Concentration (M) x Volume (L)
= 0.101 M x 40.3 mL / 1000 (conversion from mL to L)
= 0.00403 mol

The balanced equation for the reaction is:
H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

From the equation, we know that one mole of H2SO4 reacts with two moles of NaOH.",True,2,"5,2",True,2
20," So, the number of moles of H2SO4 required is half the number of moles of NaOH:

Moles of H2SO4 = Moles of NaOH / 2 
= 0.00403 mol / 2 
= 0.00201 mol

Now, we can find the volume of H2SO4 required:

Volume of H2SO4 = Number of moles / Concentration (M)
= 0.00201 mol / 0.261 M 
≈ 7.70 mL 

So, approximately 7.70 mL of 0.261 M H2SO4 is needed to react with 40.3 mL of 0.101 M NaOH.assistant

Here is the calculation:


Moles of NaOH = 0.101 M × 40.3 mL ÷ 1000 ≈ 0.00403 mol


Balanced equation: H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O


Moles of H₂SO₄ = Moles of NaOH ÷ 2 ≈ 0.00403 mol ÷ 2 ≈ 0.00201 mol


Volume of H₂SO₄ = Moles ÷ Concentration (M) ≈ 0.00201 mol ÷ 0.261 M ≈ 7.70 mL


Therefore, approximately **7.70 mL** of 0.261 M H₂SO₄ is needed to react with 40.3 mL of 0.101 M NaOH.assistant
