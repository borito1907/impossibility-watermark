Step 3: Take the square root of both sides:

√(-1) = √(-1) × √(1²)

Step 5: Simplify:

√(-1) = ±i × 1

Recall that the square root operation is the inverse of the exponentiation operation, i.e., √x = x^(1/2)

**Step 3:**
Now, we'll use Euler's Identity, which relates exponential functions to trigonometric functions:
e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)

where i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1

**Step 4:**
Substitute θ = π/2 (90 degrees), which gives us:
e^(i*π/2) = cos(π/2) + i*sin(π/2)
= 0 + i*1 (since cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1)

**Step 5:**
Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:
ln(e^(i*π/2)) = ln(i)
i*π/2 = ln(i)

**Step 6:**
Now, recall that e^(ln(x)) = x (a fundamental property of logarithms):
e^(i*π/2) = i

i = (e^(i*π))^1/2
