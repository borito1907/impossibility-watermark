To find the definite integral, we can start by finding the antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the given function:

f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1

The antiderivative is:

F(x) = (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + x + C

where C is the constant of integration.

18,"Now, to find the definite integral from 1 to 3, we'll plug in the values of x:

Definite Integral = [F(3) - F(1)]

First, let's calculate F(3):

F(3) = (2/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 3 + C 
= (2/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 3 + C 
= 18 + 27/2 + 3 + C 
= 45/2 + C

Next, let's calculate F(1):

F(1) = (2/3)(1)^3 + (3/2)(1)^2 + 1 + C 
= (2/3) + (3/2) + 1 + C 
= 11/6 + C 

Now, let's find the difference:

Definite Integral = [F(3) - F(1)] 
= [(45/2 + C) - (11/6 + C)] 
= (45/2 - 11/6) 
= (135/6 - 11/6) 
= 124/6 
= 62/3 

So, the definite integral of 2x^2 + 3x + 1 from 1 to 3 is 62/3.assistant

Here's the calculation:

∫[1, 3] (2x^2 + 3x + 1) dx =

[(2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + x] from 1 to 3 =

[(2/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 3] - [(2/3)(1)^3 + (3/2)(1)^2 + 1] =

[(2/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 3] - [(2/3) + (3/2) + 1] =

[18 + 27/2 + 3] - [2/3 + 9/2 + 1] =

[45/2] - [11/6] =

(45/2) × (6/6) - (11/6) =

(135/6) - (11/6) =

124/6 =

62/3

So the definite integral of 2x^2 + 3x + 1 from 1 to 3 is indeed **62/3**.assistant

I'm glad I could help you with that definite integral!",False,,,,1
19,"Now, to evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3, we plug in the upper and lower limits into F(x):

Definite Integral = [F(3) - F(1)]

= [(2/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 3 + C] - [(2/3)(1)^3 + (3/2)(1)^2 + 1 + C]

Simplifying, we get:

Definite Integral = [(2/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 3 - ((2/3) + (3/2) + 1)]

= [18 + (27/2) + 2]

= 42.5

So, the definite integral of 2x^2 + 3x + 1 from 1 to 3 is 42.5.assistant

I see you want me to calculate the definite integral of 2x^2 + 3x + 1 from 1 to 3.",True,1,"1,4",True,2
