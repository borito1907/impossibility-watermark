1.",True,5,"6,0",True,1
27,"**Key concepts:**

* Definition of acids and bases:
	+ Acids: substances that donate H+ ions (e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl)
	+ Bases: substances that accept H+ ions (e.g., sodium hydroxide, NaOH)
* pH scale: a logarithmic scale measuring acidity/alkalinity, ranging from 0 to 14 (pH 7 = neutral, <7 = acidic, >7 = basic)
* Strong and weak acids/bases:
	+ Strong acids/bases fully dissociate in water (e.g., HCl, NaOH)
	+ Weak acids/bases partially dissociate in water (e.g., citric acid, ammonia)

**Reactions of acids and bases:**

* Neutralization reactions: acid + base → salt + water (e.g., HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O)
* Dissociation reactions: acid or base reacting with water (e.g., HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl-, NaOH + H2O → Na+ + OH-)

**Measuring acid-base strength:**

* Concentration of hydrogen ions (H+): affects pH level and reaction rates 
* Ka (acid dissociation constant) and Kb (base association constant): measure the extent of acid/base dissociation in water 
* pKa and pKb values: negative logarithm of Ka and Kb, used to compare acid/base strengths 

**Applications and importance:**

* Biological systems: acid-base balance crucial for living organisms (e.g., blood pH, enzyme function)
* Industrial processes: acid-base chemistry involved in production of materials like paper, soap, and detergents 
* Environmental issues: acid rain, ocean acidification, and water pollution related to acid-base chemistry

28,"**Key concepts:**

### Acids and Bases Definitions:

* Acids: Substances that donate H+ ions (protons)
* Bases: Substances that accept H+ ions (protons)

### pH Scale:

* A logarithmic scale measuring acidity/basicity (pH = -log[H+])
* pH ranges:
	+ Acidic: pH < 7 (e.g., vinegar, lemon juice)
	+ Neutral: pH = 7 (e.g., water)
	+ Basic/Alkaline: pH > 7 (e.g., baking soda, soap)

### Strength of Acids and Bases:

* Strong acids: Completely dissociate in water, releasing all H+ ions (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid)
* Weak acids: Partially dissociate in water, releasing some H+ ions (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid)
* Strong bases: Completely dissociate in water, releasing all OH- ions (e.g., sodium hydroxide)
* Weak bases: Partially dissociate in water, releasing some OH- ions (e.g., ammonia, trimethylamine)

### Comparing Acid and Base Strengths:

* Acid strength: Measured by acid dissociation constant (Ka)
* Base strength: Measured by base association constant (Kb)
* pKa and pKb values: Negative log of Ka and Kb, respectively; used to compare acid and base strengths

### Applications and Examples:

* Everyday examples of acid-base chemistry (e.g., digestion, food preservation, cleaning products)
* Industrial applications (e.g., manufacturing fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics)
* Environmental impacts (e.g., acid rain, ocean acidification)

By the end of this module, students should be able to explain the definitions and properties of acids and bases, calculate pH values, and compare the strengths of various acids and bases.
