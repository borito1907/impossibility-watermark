51,"Let's use the following variables:

* m = mass of the skier (which will cancel out in our calculation)
* g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)
* h = height of the slope (40 m)
* v = velocity of the skier at the bottom (which we want to find)

We can start with the equation for potential energy at the top:

PE_top = mgh

Now, let's consider the kinetic energy at the bottom:

KE_bottom = (1/2)mv^2

Since the slope is frictionless, the total energy remains constant:

PE_top = KE_bottom

Substituting the expressions:

mgh = (1/2)mv^2

Canceling out the'm' term:

gh = (1/2)v^2

Rearranging to solve for v:

v = √(2gh)

Plugging in the given values:

v = √(2 × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m)

v ≈ 28.07 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 28.07 m/s or about 63.5 mph!assistant
