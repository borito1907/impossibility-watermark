H(x, p) = ∑[L(x, ẋ) - pẋ]dx

where p is the momentum conjugate to x:

where m is the mass of the object and ẋ is the derivative of x with respect to time t.

To transition to the Hamiltonian framework, we define the conjugate momentum p as:

p = ∂L/∂ẋ = mẋ

Substituting this expression into the Lagrangian, we get:

L(x, p/m) = p²/(2m) - (1/2)kx²

Now we can derive the Hamiltonian H(x, p):

H(x, p) = p�/m + (1/2)kx²
