where a = 1, b = 3, and c = -1.

x = (-(3) ± √((3)^2 - 4(1)(-1))) / 2(1)

Here's the solution with steps:

**Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF)**

The GCF of all terms is x, so we can factor it out:

x(x³ + 2x² - 4x + 1) = 0


**Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses**

We can factor the quadratic expression as:


x(x - 1)(x² + 3x - 1) = 0


**Step 3: Solve for each factor**

Now, we set each factor equal to 0 and solve:


1) x = 0... (1)


2) x - 1 = 0 => x = 1... (2)


3) x² + 3x - 1 = 0... (3)


To solve the quadratic equation (3), we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-(3) ± √((3)² - 4(1)(-1))) / 2(1)
x = (-3 ± √(9 + 4)) / 2

5) x = (-3 - √13) / 2... (5)

Let's try to factor the cubic equation:

x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x - 1) = 0

**Step 4: Solve the quadratic factor**
Now we have:

(x - 1) = 0 or (x^2 + 3x - 1) = 0

Solving the first factor, we get:
x - 1 = 0 --> x = 1 (another solution)

And solving the second factor, we get:
x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 --> (x + 4)(x - 1/4) = 0
