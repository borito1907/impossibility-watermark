The n-dimensional rotation matrix formula!

",True,2,"5,2",True,1
2,"For an n-dimensional space, to rotate a vector by an angle Œ∏ around an arbitrary axis defined by a unit vector (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ,..., an), the rotation matrix can be constructed as follows:

1.",True,6,"5,2",True,1
3,"In general, an n-dimensional rotation matrix can be represented as an orthogonal matrix of size n x n, that preserves the Euclidean norm of vectors.",False,,,,2
4,"For an n-dimensional space, to rotate a vector by an angle Œ∏ around an arbitrary axis, to use the Rodrigues' rotation formula, which is given as:

R = I + sin(Œ∏) * K + (1 - cos(Œ∏)) * K^2

Where R is the rotation matrix, I is the identity matrix, and K is the skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to the cross product with the unit vector along the rotation axis.

",True,7,"5,2",True,3
5,"In general, it's quite challenging to provide a single, formula that covers all cases of n-dimensional rotations.",True,7,"5,2",True,4
6,"For an n-dimensional space, to rotate a vector by an angle Œ∏ around a unit vector (a1, a2,..., an), the rotation matrix R can be expressed as:

R = I + sin(Œ∏) \* K + (1 - cos(Œ∏)) \* K^2

where:

* I is the identity matrix (an nxn matrix with 1's on the main diagonal and 0's elsewhere)
* K is the skew-symmetric matrix defined as:

K_ij = a_i * aj - ai * aj (i ‚â† j; i, j = 1, 2,..., n)

The values of a_i are the components of the unit vector (a1, a2,..., an).

",True,2,"5,2",True,5
7,"This formula works for any dimension n ‚â• 3.

",True,3,"5,2",True,1
8,"This formula generates an orthogonal matrix R that rotates a vector in the n-dimensional space.

",True,3,"5,2",True,2
9,"This formula is often referred to as Rodrigues' rotation formula.

",True,7,"5,2",True,3
10,"Note that this formula represents a rotation in the plane spanned by the vectors v and (ai, ai,..., an).",True,3,"5,2",True,4
11,"This is a generalization of the well-known Rodrigues' rotation formula for 3D spaces.

",True,3,"5,2",True,5
12,"To simplify this formula, we can rewrite it in terms of the cross-product operator ‚äó:

R = exp(Œ∏ * (a ‚äó))

This is known as Rodrigues' rotation formula.

",True,3,"5,2",True,6
13,"To break it down further:

* When i = j, K_ij = 0 (since a_i * ai - ai * ai = 0)
* When i ‚â† j, K_ij = -K_ji (due to the skew-symmetry property)

This rotation matrix formula works for any dimension n ‚â• 2.

Would you like me to elaborate on how to derive this formula or provide some examples of its usage?assistant

No worries!",True,7,"5,2",True,1
15,"Please note that when n = 3 (in 3D space), this reduces to the familiar Euler-Rodrigues formula:

R = I + sin(Œ∏) \* [ax] + (1 - cos(Œ∏)) \* [ax]^2

Where [ax] is the skew-symmetric cross-product matrix associated with the unit vector ax.
