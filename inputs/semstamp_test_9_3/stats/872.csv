Now, we can solve for x^2:

x^2 - 4 = 0 --> x^2 = 4 --> x = ±2

x^2 - 1 = 0 --> x^2 = 1 --> x = ±1

So, the solutions to the original equation are:

x = -2, x = -1, x = 1, and x = 2

There you have it!assistant

Would you like me to explain the steps in more detail or provide additional information about factoring quartic equations?assistant

I'd be happy to help with that.

",True,7,"6,2",True,48
99,"Let's try to factor it:

x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1) = 0

Now, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:

(x^2 - 4) = 0 => x^2 = 4 => x = ±2

(x^2 - 1) = 0 => x^2 = 1 => x = ±1

So, the solutions to the equation are x = -2, x = -1, x = 1, and x = 2.

",True,7,"6,2",True,49
100,"Let's factor it:

x⁴ - 21x² + 4 = (x² - 4)(x² - 17) = 0

Now, we can solve for each factor:

x² - 4 = 0 → x² = 4 → x = ±2

x² - 17 = 0 → x² = 17 → x = ±√17

So, the solutions to the original equation are:

x = 2, x = -2, x = √17, and x = -√17.
