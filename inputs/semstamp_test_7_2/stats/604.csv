55,"Unfortunately, the term ""unladen swallow"" doesn't provide enough information to accurately calculate a terminal velocity.",True,3,"6,3",True,4
56," Terminal velocity depends on factors like mass, (which affects air resistance), shape, aero-dynamism, the density of the surrounding fluid (air), and more.

",True,1,"6,0",True,1
57," Swallows are birds that come in different species, in various shapes and sizes,: a single swallow can weigh anywhere from 10-50 grams, more or less.

",True,6,"6,0",True,2
58,"However, if we assume an average weight of around 20-30 grams for a small bird like a swallow, let's do some rough calculations:

Terminal velocity is the speed at which an object falls through a fluid (like air) when the force of gravity pulling it down is balanced by the frictional force pushing it up.

",True,2,"0,3",True,1

61," It depends on factors like air density, (which varies with altitude, location, weather), wing shape, feather density etc., making it challenging to pinpoint an exact value for our hypothetical bird.

",True,0,"6,0",True,2

",False,,,,1
63,"That being said, if we assume an average swallow weight around 20-30 grams, using some general aerodynamic principles, we could make a rough estimate:

For a small bird like a swallow, to reach its terminal velocity would likely take around 10-15 seconds in still air.",False,,,,2
64,"However, I can give you some rough estimates based on similar bird species:

* A house sparrow,'terminal velocity might be around 35-45 mph (56-72 km/h).
",False,,,,3
65,"However, if we assume an average-sized swallow weighing around 20-25 grams (0.7-0.9 oz) and using some rough estimates for air resistance and drag coefficients, we could estimate its terminal velocity.

66,"One study suggests that the terminal velocity of a bird similar in size and shape to a swallow might be around 35-45 m/s (78-100 mph).
