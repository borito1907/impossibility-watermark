To prove that the limit as x approaches 4 of (5x + 3) is equal to 23 using the ε-δ definition, we need to show that for any positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that:

|f(x) - L| < ε whenever 0 < |x - a| < δ

In this case, f(x) = 5x + 3, L = 23, and a = 4.

|x - 4| < δ implies |-20 + 5x| < ε, which further implies |f(x) - L| < ε

Thus, for any ε > 0, we have found a δ > 0 (which is δ = ε/5) such that:
