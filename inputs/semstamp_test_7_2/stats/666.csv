To find the derivative of the given equation,200 sinh(x) + cosh(y) = x + y with respect to x and y, 

Let's break it down step by step:

First, let's recall the derivatives of hyperbolic sine (sinh) and hyperbolic cosine (cosh):

* The derivative of sinh(u) is cosh(u) * u'
* The derivative of cosh(u) is sinh(u) * u'

Now, apply these derivatives to the given equation:

sinh(x) + cosh(y) = x + y

Take the partial derivative with respect to x:

∂/∂x [sinh(x)] + ∂/∂x [cosh(y)] = ∂/∂x [x] + ∂/∂x [y]

Using the chain rule and the derivatives mentioned above:

cosh(x) + 0 = 1 + 0

Simplifying:

cosh(x) = 1

Next, take the partial derivative with respect to y:

∂/∂y [sinh(x)] + ∂/∂y [cosh(y)] = ∂/∂y [x] + ∂/∂y [y]

Again using the chain rule and the derivatives mentioned above:

0 + sinh(y) = 0 + 1

Simplifying:

sinh(y) = 1

So, we have two equations:

cosh(x) = 1... (1)
sinh(y) = 1... (2)

These equations represent the derivatives of the original equation with respect to x and y.
