20,"The ABC Conjecture, proposed by David Masser and Joseph Oesterlé in 1985, states that:

""For any ε > 0, there exists a constant Kε such that for all coprime positive integers A, B, and C satisfying A + B = C, we have:

d(A · B · C) ≤ Kε · (rad(A · B · C))^(1 + ε)

where d(n) is the product of distinct prime factors of n, rad(n) is the radical of n (i.e., the product of its distinct prime factors), and ε is any positive real number.""
