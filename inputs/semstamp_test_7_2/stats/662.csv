- `c` raised to increasingly higher powers as `d` approaches infinity

Now, let's analyze the product of these terms:

When `d = 0`, the expression evaluates to `a*(1-c)`
When `d = 1`, the expression evaluates to `c*(a+b)*(1-c)`
When `d = 2`, the expression evaluates to `c^2*(a+2b)*(1-c)`
...

As `d` approaches infinity, the terms will be `c` raised to higher and higher powers, multiplied by `(a+d*b)*(1-c)`

The sum of these terms can be written as:

`S = a*(1-c) + c*(a+b)*(1-c) + c^2*(a+2b)*(1-c) +...`

For `d = 1`: `c*(a+b)*(1-c) = c*(a+b) - c^2*(a+b)`
For `d = 2`: `c^2*(a+2b)*(1-c) = c^2*(a+2b) - c^3*(a+2b)`
...
For `d = n`: `c^n*(a+n*b)*(1-c) = c^n*(a+n*b) - c^(n+1)*(a+n*b)`
