A delightful mathematical proof!

",True,1,"6,2",True,50
51,"The claim is that the sum of the inverses of prime numbers diverges, the harmonic series of primes:

1/p₁ + 1/p₂ + 1/p₃ +...

where p₁ = 2, p₂ = 3, p₃ = 5,... are consecutive prime numbers.

",True,3,"6,2",True,1
52,"To prove that the sum of the inverses of prime numbers diverges, a common approach is to use the following inequality:

$$\sum_{p \leq x} \frac{1}{p} > \log(\log(x)) - C,$$

where $p$ represents prime numbers, in ascending order, and $C$ is a constant.

",True,0,"6,2",True,2
53,"The statement ""the sum of the inverses of the prime numbers diverges"" means that:

∑ (1/p) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 +... = ∞

where p denotes a prime number.

",True,3,"6,2",True,3
54,"The sum of the inverses of prime numbers is known as the ""prime reciprocal series.""",True,3,"6,2",True,4
55,"The divergence of the sum of the inverses of prime numbers is a famous result in number theory, known as the ""prime harmonic series.""",True,3,"6,2",True,5
56,"The sum of the inverses of the prime numbers is known as the ""prime reciprocal series.""",True,3,"6,2",True,6
57,"The sum of the inverses of prime numbers is known as the ""prime reciprocal series"" or ""prime harmonic series"".",True,3,"6,2",True,7
58,"The sum of the inverses of the prime numbers is:

$$\sum_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \cdots$$

To prove that this sum diverges, (grows without bound), we can use the following approach:

**Step 1: Lower bound**

Consider the harmonic series:

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots$$

This series is known to diverge.

",True,2,"6,2",True,8
59,"Now, let's create a lower bound for our prime inverse sum by selecting only those terms in the harmonic series where $n$ is a prime number:

$$\sum_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{p} \geq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n)}{n}$$

where $\chi(n) = 1$ if $n$ is prime, and $\chi(n) = 0$ otherwise.
