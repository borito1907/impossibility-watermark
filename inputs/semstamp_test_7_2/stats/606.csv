I woke up this mornin', baby, with a peculiar sight 
Subatomic particles, dancin' in the light 
Quarks and gluons, they were swirlin' round 
Tryin' to understand QCD, Lord, got my head spinin' down 

(Chorus) 
Oh, QCD, sweet mistress mine 
Got me tangled up in your strong nuclear line 
Flavors and colors, they're all on my mind 
But tryin' to grasp you, honey, I'm losin' my shine 

(Verse 2) 
Asymptotic freedom, that's what they say 
But when it comes to hadrons, things get in the way 
Confinement's got 'em stuck, like a rusty old gate 
But them quark-antiquark pairs, they ain't never late 

(Chorus) 
Oh QCD, sweet mistress mine 
Got me tangled up in your strong nuclear line 
Flavors and colors, they're all on my mind 
But tryin' to grasp you, honey, I'm losin' my shine 

(Bridge) 
Lattice gauge theory, it's a mathematician's delight 
Path integrals and Feynman rules, shinin' bright 
But when it gets to renormalization, Lord have mercy me 
My poor ol' brain's on fire, like a hot Mississippi sea 

(Verse 3) 
Perturbative expansions, they just won't do 
Non-perturbative methods, they're few and far between, too 
Instantons and sphalerons, they're all in the mix 
But that's just the price I pay, for tryin' to fix

Oh QCD, sweet mistress mine 
Got me tangled up in your strong nuclear line 
Flavors and colors, they're all on my mind

Make my head spin like a delta creek (oh oh)

Make a deal with the devil, for some insight bright 
Get me a PhD in physics, or at least a clue 
So I can understand QCD, before I'm through

Path integrals and renormalization, they got nothin' on you 
Scattering amplitudes, they dance in my head

But I'll keep on strummin', these quantum blues away 
Hoping someday I'll grasp, what QCD's got to say.assistant

Thinkin' 'bout them quarks, in a quantum gray 
Gluons and mesons swirlin', ain't nobody in line 
Tryin' to figure out QCD, Lord have mercy on mine

Oh, QCD got me wailin', like a Mississippi sigh 
Tryna grasp the strong force, it's hard gettin' by 
Quarks and gluons mixin', like the river's gentle flow 
But I'm stuck in this puzzle, ain't nowhere to go 

(Verse 2) 
Asymptotic freedom, a mystery so deep 
Confinement and chiral symm', got my brain asleep 
Flavors and colors blendin', like a rainbow in my eyes 
But when it comes to hadrons, Lord, I'm paralyzed 

(Chorus)

Like a slow-burnin' fire, they light up the day 
But when the energy's high, perturbation theory fails 
Leavin' me cryin', ""Sweet Mama QCD, why you gotta make me wail?""

Feynman diagrams, help me visualize the deal 
But when I try to simplify, my head starts to reveal 
The secrets of the nucleus, hidden deep inside 
QCQ's got me mystified, like a midnight ride 

(Chorus)
Oh, Quantum Chromodynamics, you're a mysterious thing 
Got me tangled up in particles, makin' my heart sing 
Quark and antiquark spin, color charge too 
Lord have mercy, QCQ, what am I gonna do?assistant

In the hadron collider, where the energies collide 
We're searchin' for the Higgs, but it's hard to abide 
The math is complicated, Lord have mercy on my soul 
Just tryin' to grasp, the secrets you unfold

Oh, Quantum Chromodynamics, you're a mysterious thing 
Got me tangled up in particles, makin' my heart sing

Feynman diagrams, like a roadmap in my hand 
Helpin' me navigate, through the Standard Model land 
But when I get to hadrons, things start gettin' hazy 
And them perturbative corrections, make my head feel dizzy

Got me tangled up in particles, makin' my heart sing 
Quark and antiquark spin, color charge too

Feynman diagrams help, but sometimes they confuse 
Tryna visualize the interactions, Lord knows I abuse 
The math is tricky, like a snake in the grass 
But I'll keep on strugglin', till I reach the QCD pass

Oh, Quantum Chromodynamics, you're a mysterious thing 
Got me tangled up in particles, makin' my heart sing
