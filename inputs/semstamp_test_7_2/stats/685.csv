A nice hyperbolic trigonometry question!

Let's find the derivatives:

**Given equation:** sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x + 1

**Derivative:**

Using the chain rule, a derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.

1. Derivative of sinh(x):
The derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x), so we have:
d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)

2. Derivative of cosh(x):
The derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), so we have:
d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

Now, let's find the derivative of the entire expression:

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (x + 1)

Using the sum rule, to differentiate the left-hand side, we get:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1

So, the final answer is:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1assistant

Let's find the derivatives:

**Given equation:** sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1

To find the derivative, we'll apply the chain rule and the formulas for the derivatives of hyperbolic functions:

**Derivative of sinh(x):** d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)

**Derivative of cosh(x):** d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

So, let's compute the derivative of both sides:

A nice hyperbolic trigonometric identity!

The equation is:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = e^x

To find the derivative, a good approach is to use the chain rule and the fact that:

d/dx (e^(u)) = e^(u) \* du/dx

Let's start by finding the derivatives of each term separately:

1. d/dx (sinh(x)):
Using the definition of sinh(x) as (e^x - e^(-x))/2, Remebering that d/dx (e^(u)) = e^(u) \* du/dx,

d/dx (sinh(x)) = d/dx ((e^x - e^(-x))/2)
= (e^x - (-e^(-x))) / 2 (using the chain rule)
= (e^x + e^(-x)) / 2

2. d/dx (cosh(x)):
Using the definition of cosh(x) as (e^x + e^(-x))/2,

d/dx (cosh(x)) = d/dx ((e^x + e^(-x))/2)
= (e^x - (-e^(-x))) / 2 (using the chain rule)
= (e^x + e^(-x)) / 2

Now, let's find the derivative of the right-hand side:
3. d/dx (e^x):
This one is straightforward:

d/dx (e^x) = e^x

Now, combine the results:
d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (e^x)

(e^x + e^(-x)) / 2 + (e^x + e^(-x)) / 2 = e^x

Combine like terms:
(e^x + e^(-x) + e^x + e^(-x)) / 2 = e^x

Simplify:
(e^x + e^x + e^(-x) + e^(-x)) / 2 = e^x

(2e^x + 2e^(-x)) / 2 = e^x

e^x + e^(-x) = e^x

Which is an identity! The derivatives match on both sides.

So, we've successfully found the derivative of the original equation:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = e^x

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (e^x)

(e^x + e^(-x)) / 2 + (e^x + e^(-x)) / 2 = e^xassistant

A nice hyperbolic function question!

Let's break it down step by step:

We're given:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x + x

First, let's recall the definitions of sinh and cosh:

sinh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / 2 
cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2

Now, substitute these into the original equation:

(e^x - e^-x) / 2 + (e^x + e^-x) / 2 = 2x 

Combine like terms:

e^x - e^-x + e^x + e^-x = 4x

Simplify:

2e^x = 4x

Divide both sides by 2:

e^x = 2x

Now, to find the derivative, we'll use the chain rule. Let u = x, then y = e^u.

The derivative of y with respect to u is:

dy/du = e^u

Using the chain rule, we multiply by du/dx:

dy/dx = e^u \* du/dx

Substitute back in u = x:

dy/dx = e^x \* 1 (since du/dx = 1)

So, the derivative is:

dy/dx = e^x = 2x

Therefore, the final answer is:

dy/dx = 2xassistant

**Derivative of sinh(x):**
d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)

**Derivative of cosh(x):**
d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

Now, the derivative of the given expression:
d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (x + 1)

Using the linearity of the derivative operator:
d/dx (sinh(x)) + d/dx (cosh(x)) = d/dx (x) + d/dx (1)

Substituting the derivatives:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1 + 0

Simplifying:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1

So, the derivative of sinh(x) + cosh(x) is equal to 1.assistant

A nice hyperbolic function question!

Let's find the derivatives:

**Given equation:** sinh(x) + cosh(x) =?

**Derivative of sinh(x):** d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)

**Derivative of cosh(x):** d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

So, (using linearity of the derivative),

**Derivative of the given equation:**

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = cosh(x) + sinh(x)

Therefore, we have:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x ⇒ cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1assistant

I apologize for the mistake earlier! The correct answer is:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) ≠ x

But,

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (sinh(x)) + d/dx (cosh(x))
= cosh(x) + sinh(x)

A nice hyperbolic function question!

The given equation is:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2cosh(x)

To find the derivative, we'll differentiate each term separately:

1. Derivative of sinh(x):
Using the chain rule and the fact that d/dx (e^x) = e^x,

d/dx (sinh(x)) = d/dx ((e^x - e^(-x))/2)
= (e^x - e^(-x))/2 + (e^x + e^(-x))/2 (since d/dx (e^(kx)) = ke^(kx))
= e^x + e^(-x)
= 2cosh(x)

So, d/dx (sinh(x)) = 2cosh(x).

2. Derivative of cosh(x):
Similarly,
d/dx (cosh(x)) = d/dx ((e^x + e^(-x))/2)
= (e^x + e^(-x))/2 - (e^x - e^(-x))/2 (since d/dx (e^(kx)) = ke^(kx))
= e^x - e^(-x)
= 2sinh(x)

So, d/dx (cosh(x)) = 2sinh(x).

A hyperbolic function question!

The given equation is:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1

To find the derivative, to this equation, we'll apply the chain rule and the sum rule of differentiation.

Recall that:
- The derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x)
- The derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x)

So, let's differentiate both sides of the equation:

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (2x + 1)

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2

Now, simplify the expression:

2(cosh(x) + sinh(x)/2) = 2

So, the derivative of the given equation is 2.

A nice hyperbolic function question!

Let's find the derivatives:

**Given equation:** sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x + 1

**To find:** The derivatives of both sides with respect to x.

**Derivative of left side:**

Using the chain rule and the derivatives of hyperbolic functions:

d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)
d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

So, the derivative of the left side is:
cosh(x) + sinh(x)

**Derivative of right side:**

The derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of 1 is 0.
So, the derivative of the right side is:
1 + 0 = 1

**Equating the derivatives:**
Now, equate the derivatives of both sides:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1

A nice hyperbolic trigonometry problem!

Let's break it down:

We have: sinh(x) + cosh(x) =?? +??

To find the derivatives, (sinh(x))' and (cosh(x))', we can use the following formulas:

* (sinh(x))' = cosh(x)
* (cosh(x))' = sinh(x)

Now, (applying the power rule for differentiation):

* (sinh²(x))' = 2(sinh(x))(cosh(x))
* (cosh²(x))' = 2(cosh(x))(sinh(x))

So, putting it all together:

(d/dx)[sinh(x) + cosh(x)] = d/dx[sinh²(x) + cosh²(x)]

= 2(sinh(x))(cosh(x)) + 2(cosh(x))(sinh(x))

= 2(sinh(x) + cosh(x))(cosh(x) + sinh(x))

Simplifying further:

= 2(cosh²(x) + sinh²(x))(cosh(x) + sinh(x))

Using the Pythagorean identity for hyperbolic functions:

cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1

We can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as:

(cosh²(x) + sinh²(x)) = (cosh²(x) - sinh²(x)) + 2(sinh²(x))

= 1 + 2(sinh²(x))

Substituting this back into our previous result:

= 2(1 + 2(sinh²(x)))(cosh(x) + sinh(x))

Expanding and simplifying further, we finally get:

= 2(cosh(x) + sinh(x)) + 4(sinh²(x))(cosh(x) + sinh(x))
