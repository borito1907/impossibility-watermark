COVID, which stands from Coronavirus disease, was first introduced as COVID 19 (Coro-n-a-viRus-disease) by World Health Organization (W-H-O). It's an infectious disease caused by SARS-Co-v-two virus, and it has had devastating effects on the world.

As of my knowledge cutoff, the pandemic began to unfold globally at the turn of 20203, spreading across more than 200 countries. The rapid transmission led the world health organ-is-a-t-ion declaring it an outbreak.

Here are some key facts that highlight the impact in 2023: **Global Cases & Vaccination Efforts** By 2023 about 640 million cases were reported worldwide, along with over 6 million deaths.

However as vaccination efforts have accelerated, the number of new infections has decreased dramatically, especially among those who received their shots.

Vaccination rates varied greatly depending on region, country, and even within countries due to various socio-economic, cultural, political, religious factors. Some countries achieved remarkable success while others struggled.

There is still ongoing research into long-term effects of Covid 19, including lingering symptoms and conditions often collectively known ""Long COVID"". These can range from mild issues, such as fatigue or brain fog, all way up to severe complications affecting multiple organs.

Many people suffered financially, emotionally, physically, spiritually. Mental health issues skyrocketed during lockdowns, isolation. Small businesses went bankrupt, employees laid off temporarily, permanently.

Globally, economies contracted, trade plummeted, tourism stopped.

In 2023, we see that though many countries have lifted restrictions, mask mandates, social gatherings resumed slowly life returning semblance of normalcy.

Travel restrictions relaxed allowing families reunite after years apart but also raised fears of resurgence.

This pandemic exposed glaring gaps healthcare infrastructure preparedness worldwide, prompting governments reassessing emergency response plans for better handling pandemics future.

While we are making great strides toward healing, rebuilding, it's clear that effects of Covid 19 be felt years come.

The pandemic accelerated digital transformation, online shopping, e-learning; changing lives, workplaces forever<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,468.81062388420105

I'll provide you an example of Acoustic Nearfield Holography ( SONAh) code using python.

**Please Note:** Before we dive straightaway, I would suggest that you should be aware of basic signal processing and numerical methods as they are used extensively in SONAH.

```python 
import numpy as np
from numpy.fft import fft2, fftshift
import math 

def calculate_pressure(pressure_field):
    # This is a simplified method to calculate sound pressure at each point from source position 
    return 1/(np.sqrt((pressure_field[:, 1])**2+(pressure_field[:, 3])**2+(pressure_field[:, 6])**2))

# Pressure field array: [x, y, amplitude] * number of mics 
num_of_mic = 16 
mic_positions = np.zeros([num_of_mic, 9])
for j in range(num_of_mic):
    x = j/4 
    mic_positions[j] = [0.1*x, 1, 1,0.1*x+1,1,0.1*x+2,0.05, x+ 1, 1]

sona-pressure = calculate_pressure(mic_positions)

reconstruction_space_size_x = 512 
reconstruction_space_size_y = 512

px = 1e-3  # pixel size of reconstructed space (m)

fx = np.linspace(-1 / (2 * px), 1 / (2 * px), int(reconstruction_space_size_x))  # spatial frequencies along x
fy = np.linspace(-1 / (2 * px), 1 / (2 * px), int(reconstruction_space_size_y))  # spatial frequencies along y

Fxx, _ =np.meshgri(fx,fy)

Fxx = fftshift(Fxx)
Fyy = fftshift(fy)

k = 1e8  # angular spectrum sampling rate (1/m)

H = 1/np.sqrt(1+(k*math.pi/6*math.pi/6)*((k*fx*k*fxx+ k*fy*k*fyy)))  

for f in k:
    P = fftshift(fft(sona_pressure))
```
Here's what it does:
1. The `calculate_pressure` function calculates sound pressure at each microphone position based on some assumptions (distance between source to microphones etc). You can replace it with any other method to get sound pressures at each point.

2. It then generates an array for storing sound pressure values at different microphones.

3. We then define a 3d space (reconstructed space). Each point represents a possible source location.

4. We generate a mesh of spatial frequencies (fx and fy).

5. We shift these spatial frequencies to centre at zero.

6. We compute angular spectrum of sound field at each point (H).

7. In last loop we perform fast fourier transform (FFT) over sound pressures and multiply it by angular spectrum of sound field to get reconstructed sound field at each point of reconstructed space.

Note : Please note that real-world applications may be quite complex and might include many factors which are ignored here (like sound velocity, temperature etc). Hence, you may see variations in output.

Also, remember this is just a simple Python script illustrating Acoustic Nearfield Holography ( SONAh ) concepts. Real-life implementation could be lot more involved.

Do let me know if I can help further!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1188.8479034900665

What an exciting and challenging pursuit! Mastering Super StringTheory requires an incredible amount of effort, but I'll provide you an overview of an ideal learning roadmap, assuming you're proficient at least at an intermediate level of linear algebra and basic differential/integral calculus. Here's a step-by-step curriculum to help you reach your target:
