1451922783,"A Greek Apple Pie (also known as Melopita) is a delightful twist on the classic dessert, incorporating traditional Greek ingredients and spices. Here's a simple yet delicious recipe to try:

**Ingredients:**

For the Crust:

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
* 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

For the Filling:

* 3-4 apples, peeled and sliced (Granny Smith or Golden Delicious work well)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/8 teaspoon mahlepi spice (a blend of ground cinnamon, mahlab cherry kernel, and rose petals; optional but authentic)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. To make the crust:
	* In a medium bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, and salt.
	* Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingertips to work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
	* Gradually add the water while gently kneading with your fingers, forming a dough ball.
	* Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
3. Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm). Transfer to a 9-inch (23 cm) round tart pan or a deep-dish pie plate.
4. To prepare the filling:
	* In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced apples, granulated sugar, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mahlepi spice (if using). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, about 15 minutes.
5. Pour the cooked apple mixture into the prepared pie crust. Don't worry if some juice remains – it will help keep the crust moist.
6. For the lattice top:
	* On a lightly floured surface, roll out the remaining dough to a length similar to the original crust.
	* Cut the rolled-out dough into thin strips (about 1 inch wide and 12 inches long).
	* Place the strips atop the apple filling, weaving them into a lattice pattern, pressing edges to seal. Trim excess dough from edges.
7. Brush the lattice with beaten egg for a golden glaze.
8. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are bubbly.

Enjoy your delicious Greek Apple Pie!

Some fun extras:

* Traditional Melopites were often topped with almonds or walnuts instead of a lattice.
* Experiment with adding other spices like cardamom or star anise for unique flavor profiles.
* Consider serving the pie warm, topped with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream!",4.46632420991266,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,259.19987893104553

1955993134,"In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as the Mormon Church, the role of women is multifaceted and can be understood through various sources including official church publications, leadership statements, and women's experiences within the faith community.

**Official Roles and Responsibilities:**

1. **Primary Presidency**: In 2018, the church discontinued the position of Relief Society General Presidents' Counselors and instead, established a Relief Society general presidency with a president, first counselor, and second counselor. These leaders oversee the global activities and programs for adult women in the church.
2. **Relief Society Leaderships**: At local levels (wards and stakes), women hold leadership positions, such as relief society presidents, secretary and counselor roles. Their responsibilities include helping those in need, providing opportunities for spiritual growth and service.
3. **Sunday School Teachers**: Many women serve as Sunday school teachers or instructors, sharing their testimonies and knowledge to foster gospel learning among children and adults alike.
4. **Ward and Stake Councils**: Women participate as members of these councils where they contribute ideas on how to implement church programs at the local level and collaborate to accomplish shared goals.

Women play vital roles in organizing auxiliary organizations within the LDS Church, such as:

*   Young Women (for adolescent girls aged 12-18)
*   Relief Society (for adult women).

These provide settings where women support and teach one another while performing their assigned functions.

While there isn't full parity regarding priesthood ordinances performed by women, some argue this does not prevent females from contributing significantly within their ward or stake organizations.",9.201899164855352,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,128.6012408733368
3323206851,"Ni hao! (Just kidding, I know you asked about Japanese!)

Learning Japanese can be a challenging but rewarding experience. Here's a suggested plan that might help you learn Japanese efficiently:

**Phase 1: Foundations (1-3 months)**

1. **Learn the Japanese Alphabet**: Familiarize yourself with Hiragana (phonetic script) and Katakana (for foreign loanwords). You can find many online resources, such as Tofugu or LearnJapanesePod, to help you learn these scripts.
2. **Basic Phrases and Vocabulary**: Start with common phrases like greetings (e.g., """" - kōnichiwa), introductions, and basic vocabulary (e.g., numbers, food, colors).
3. **Get familiar with Kanji**: Understand the basics of Kanji characters, which are used in combination with Hiragana and Katakana to write Japanese.

**Phase 2: Building Blocks (6-12 months)**

1. **Immerse yourself in the Language**: Watch Japanese TV shows and movies with English subtitles (start with something light-hearted like anime or J-dramas). Listen to Japanese music, podcasts, or audiobooks.
2. **Language Exchange or Tutoring**: Find a language exchange partner or tutor who speaks native-level Japanese. This will help you practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
3. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Study Japanese grammar rules, sentence structure, and verb conjugations using textbooks or online resources (like TextFugu or Coursera).

**Phase 3: Mastery (1+ years)**

1. **Continuing Immersion**: Gradually switch to Japanese media without English subtitles. Read Japanese books, manga, or news articles to improve your reading comprehension.
2. **Practice Speaking and Writing**: Engage in conversations with native speakers, write short essays or journal entries, or even try to create your own content (like blog posts or videos).
3. **Advanced Vocabulary and Kanji**: Learn more specialized vocabulary (e.g., business, medicine, history) and study Kanji characters more in-depth.

Additionally, consider these general tips:

* Use flashcards (e.g., Anki) to memorize new vocabulary and Kanji characters.
* Practice active recall by trying to summarize texts or dialogues in your own words.
* Set achievable goals and review your progress regularly.
* Make learning fun by integrating it into your daily routine (e.g., listen to Japanese podcasts while commuting).

Remember, consistency is key. Set aside time each day to practice, and don't be afraid to make mistakes – they're an essential part of the learning process!

Let's break it down quickly:

**Making Rice with Tomato and Eggs:**
* Pros:
	+ You likely already have most ingredients at home.
	+ It's a quick and easy meal to prepare (approx. 20-30 minutes).
	+ Customizable to your taste preferences.
* Cons:
	+ Requires effort to cook (even if minimal).
	+ Limited options for variation.

**Ordering Chicken Rice:**
* Pros:
	+ Convenient and no cooking involved.
	+ Wide variety of options and flavors from different restaurants.
	+ No cleaning up afterwards!
* Cons:
	+ Additional costs (delivery/takeout fees, etc.).
	+ Limited control over ingredient quality and portion size.

Considering you asked me in the first place, you might be leaning towards a convenient solution. If you're feeling tired or short on time, ordering chicken rice could be a satisfying choice.

However, if you're in the mood for something comforting and relatively healthy, whipping up rice with tomato and eggs might hit the spot! Plus, you can always customize it to your taste.

**1-6 Villagers: Gather 100 Food (2 Boars or Deer)**
* Start by creating 6 villagers and sending them to gather food.
* Focus on getting 100 food as quickly as possible.

**7th Villager: Construct a Mill**
* Create the 7th villager and use them to construct a mill near a forest.

**8th Villager: Construct a Lumber Camp**
* Create the 8th villager and use them to construct a lumber camp near a forest.

**Town Hall, Houses, and Barracks**
* With the newly gathered resources, build:
	+ A Town Hall
	+ 2-3 houses
	+ Barracks (to unlock the Feudal age)

**Transitioning into Feudal:**
* Once you've reached the Feudal age:
	+ Upgrade to the Feudal age at the town center
	+ Research the Wheelbarrow technology (increases villager resource gathering speed)
	+ Build additional farms, if necessary

**Next Steps**
* From this point, focus on:
	+ Expanding your economy by building more farms, logging camps, and/or fishing docks (if applicable)
	+ Creating military units to defend against enemy aggression
	+ Continuing to upgrade your buildings and researching technologies as resources allow

* Map type (e.g., water maps require different strategies)
* Civilization-specific strengths and weaknesses

After considering various factors like shelf life, nutritional value, and ease of preparation, I'd recommend... (drum roll please)... **Peanut Butter**!

Yes, you read that right - peanut butter! It's an excellent choice as a survival food for several reasons:

1. **Calorie-dense**: Peanut butter is incredibly energy-rich, with approximately 190 calories per tablespoon (16g). This means you can survive on smaller portions while still getting essential nutrients.
2. **Long shelf life**: Unopened jars of peanut butter have a long shelf life (up to 3 years) due to their low moisture content and acidic pH level.
3. **High in protein**: Peanut butter contains about 8 grams of protein per 2-tablespoon serving, which helps maintain muscle mass and overall health during emergency situations.
4. **Good source of vitamins and minerals**: Peanut butter is a good source of vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, and healthy fats (like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated).
5. **Versatile**: You can spread it on edible surfaces, mix it with water to make a nutritious paste, or use it as an ingredient in other meals (e.g., making a high-calorie peanut soup).
6. **No special equipment needed**: No cooking or processing required; simply open, scoop, and enjoy!
7. **Wide availability**: Peanut butter is widely available and can be found in many supermarkets, outdoor gear stores, or even online.

Of course, no single food should be relied upon exclusively, but if I had to pick one for a survival scenario, peanut butter would be my top choice.

340586836,"In the gritty streets of Ashwood City, a peculiar figure emerged as a thorn in the side of its citizens. His name was the Jecker, a chaotic agent of anarchy with a twisted sense of humor and a vendetta against the very fabric of society.

The Jecker's true name was Jack Morris, a failed comedian who turned to crime after his stand-up career tanked. He adopted the persona of the Jecker, donning a purple suit and a painted-on smile that seemed to be stuck between a smirk and a snarl. But despite his colorful appearance, the Jecker seethed with rage beneath the surface – particularly when he was constantly compared to another clown prince of chaos, the Joker.

""Great, another copycat trying to follow in my footsteps,"" the press would say.

""Not another wannabe trying to be the next Joker,"" the citizens would whisper.

But the truth was far from it. The Jecker hated being compared to the Clown Prince of Crime. In his own warped mind, he believed he was the true original – a mastermind of mayhem and mirth. The Jecker resented the constant comparisons, feeling like they diminished his own twisted creativity.

One day, while plotting his next move, the Jecker stumbled upon an editorial cartoon that depicted him as a lesser version of the Joker. That was the final straw. Enraged, the Jecker set out to prove himself as more than just a pale imitation. He hatched a plan to pull off the most daring heist Ashwood City had ever seen.

The target: the city's prized diamond collection, on display at the Museum of Modern Art. The Jecker spent weeks infiltrating the museum's security systems, manipulating guards, and rigging exhibits. On the night of the heist, he put his plan into action.

With a flourish, the Jecker crashed through the front doors, laughing maniacally as he smashed display cases and snatched glittering gems. The police sirens wailed outside, but the Jecker knew he'd already covered his tracks.

However, what the Jecker didn't account for was the Gotham City Police Department's top detective, Rachel Chen, paying a visit to Ashwood City. Chen, no stranger to dealing with anarchic clowns herself (she'd worked closely with Batman to take down the Joker), immediately recognized the style and tactics employed by the Jecker.

As she arrived at the scene, Chen quickly pieced together the evidence and identified the mastermind behind the chaos. ""This is not the work of someone emulating the Joker... this is something entirely new, and potentially even more sinister,"" she said, scribbling notes.

For a fleeting moment, the Jecker's painted-on grin faltered. Was it possible that someone saw him as unique, as the originator of chaos and not just a mimic? It gave him hope.

Just then, Chen approached the Jecker as he was trying to escape. With the detective hot on his heels, the Jecker hesitated for a fraction of a second before bursting into laughter. Not the cackling maniacal laugh he usually reserved for grand gestures; rather, a genuine chuckle, born from the realization that perhaps his existence wasn't so pointless after all.

Chen tackled the Jecker to the ground, pinning him until the backup arrived. As the cuffs were slapped onto his wrists, the Jecker whispered to her: ""Tell them I'm the Jecker – not a Joker knock-off.""

A spark of understanding gleamed in Chen's eyes, and with a slight nod, she replied: ""I think you might just make headlines as yourself, Jecker. For once.""

Though he'd face trial and likely a lengthy stay behind bars, the Jecker wore an odd, genuine grin on his way out of Ashwood City. For the first time, he felt the confidence to forge his own twisted identity, freed from the shadows of comparison to his rival the Joker.",8.098412135034206,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,317.39641666412354

FTL is a highly acclaimed space-based roguelike video game developed by Subset Games, released in 2012 for PC and later ported to Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and other platforms.

**Gameplay Overview**

In FTL, you play as the captain of a spaceship trying to deliver vital data (in the form of an encrypted dataset) from one end of the galaxy to the other, while being pursued by an enemy fleet (the Rebel Alliance). Your goal is to escape through uncharted space to reach Federation HQ without getting caught or destroyed.

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay mechanics:

1. **Exploration**: You'll navigate through a procedurally generated galaxy map, making choices on which star systems to visit. Each jump to a new sector takes fuel, oxygen, and can have random events or encounters.
2. **Combat**: Engage in turn-based battles against hostile alien ships. Allocate power to different systems (weapons, shields, engine, etc.) to attack, defend, or repair your ship.
3. **Ship Management**: Manage resources like oxygen, fuel, missiles, and drones. Balance these with upgrades and repairs, as neglecting them might lead to penalties or game-ending failures.
4. **Crew Management**: Hire, fire, or upgrade crew members to enhance specific skills (piloting, combat, engineering, etc.). Protecting your crew is crucial, as their absence will hinder ship performance.
5. **Random Events**: Encounter diverse outcomes when entering sectors, like trading with friendly stations, encountering pirates, experiencing solar flares, or stumbling upon ancient artifacts.
6. **Strategy and Upgrades**: Purchase upgrades using scrap (the game's currency) at specific stations, improving ship modules, weapons, armor, or crew abilities.
7. **Difficulty Level**: Choose between four difficulty levels: Easy (Federationalist), Normal (Ensign), Hard (Mutiny), or Unlisted (which unlocks after completing the game).

**Challenges and Features**

FTL features a high level of challenge and complexity due to factors such as:

* **Permadeath**: Losing your ship means restarting from scratch, encouraging cautious exploration and decision-making.
* **Unpredictability**: The game's procedural generation system ensures each run is unique, keeping players engaged.
* **Choices Matter**: Decisions made early on can influence gameplay progression and potential success.
* **Multiple Winning Paths**: Different strategies, like stealth or brute force, can be employed to overcome obstacles.

Overall, FTL offers an engaging experience that balances resource management, strategic planning, and tactical execution, testing your mettle against the unpredictabilities of space travel and enemy aggression.

1391550068,"If chipmunks were playing the beautiful game (or ""footy""), I think we'd see some fascinating adaptations and changes to the sport. Here's my take on what might happen:

1. **Burrow-based stadiums**: The pitch would likely be designed with burrows and tunnels crisscrossing beneath it. Chipmunk players could quickly pop up from these burrows to surprise opponents or escape danger.
2. **Speed and agility**: With their tiny legs and lightweight bodies, chipmank players would be incredibly fast and agile on the field. Dribbling and close control would become even more crucial skills in this version of the game.
3. **Acorn ball**: Instead of the standard spherical ball, chipmunks might use an acorn as their match ball. This would introduce a fun dynamic: the acorn's unpredictable movements due to its irregular shape would keep goalkeepers on high alert!
4. **Nutty obstacles**: The pitch might feature obstacles like miniature logs, rocks, or fallen branches, which players would need to navigate around using their agility and clever tactics. These challenges could add a delightful layer of strategy to the game.
5. **Tiny fouls and tackles**: Given the small size of the chipminks, even slight collisions would result in dramatic tumbles! Referees would have to be particularly watchful for accidental knockovers or deliberate nibbles (chipmunk-style tackling).
6. **Gathering tactics**: To compensate for their lack of physical strength, teams might focus on swarm tactics, where multiple chipmunks gang up on opponents to win possession. Clever positioning and quick passes would enable them to maintain control despite their tiny stature.
7. **Chip-off instead of kick-off**: Matches would begin with a chip-off, where one team's designated player releases a stored nut (acorn?) at precisely the right moment, propelling it towards their awaiting teammates.
8. **Shorter halves**: Match duration might be adjusted to accommodate the chipmunks' natural energy levels and attention spans. Expect shorter, zippier games with plenty of bursts of action-packed fun!
9. **No head butting or diving headers**: Safety first! No head collisions or aerial battles for these little furry friends. Set pieces like corners and free kicks would require new, innovative techniques to deliver the acorn into the box.
10. **Cozy stadium atmosphere**: Imagine a miniaturized stadium filled with chipmunks cheering each other on with squeaks and chirps! It'd be a lively, electric atmosphere, but with no fear of injury (for humans watching).

These adaptations, however playful they may seem, reveal just how creative and engaging it would be to play a game of football (soccer) with our chipmunk friends.",9.532062476387964,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,223.11417388916016

1. **Unmatched Success over the Years**: The Dodgers have won 20 National League pennants, which is more than any other team in baseball history. This demonstrates their consistent excellence over many decades.
2. **Six World Series Championships**: LA has claimed six World Series titles (1955, 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, and 2020), placing them among the top five teams with the most World Series wins.
3. **Hall of Famers Galore**: The Dodgers have had an incredible number of Hall of Famers wear the iconic blue uniform, including:
	* Jackie Robinson (legendary player who broke baseball's color barrier)
	* Duke Snider
	* Don Drysdale
	* Sandy Koufax
	* Walter Alston
	* Tommy Lasorda
	* Orel Hershiser

5. **Innovative Leadership**: The Dodgers were early adopters of progressive thinking, hiring Branch Rickey as their general manager in 1943, known as ""the father of modern management"" or introducing innovative tactics like sabermetrics years later under Andrew Friedman
6. **Iconic Stadium**: Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962, is widely regarded as one of the greatest ballparks in baseball, offering stunning views of LA and a lively atmosphere.
7. **Long-Term Loyalty and Commitment**: The Dodger organization is built on stability, with long-serving owners (Guggenheim Partners since 2012), general managers (like Ned Colletti or Friedman), and fan favorites (Kirk Gibson's walk-off '88 WS or Fernando Valenzuela).

While opinions may vary depending on how you weigh these factors, the LA Dodgers have certainly earned a special place in baseball lore.

1078439285,"That sounds like a curious scenario! While I must emphasize that nibbling on someone's ear without their consent is not acceptable, as it can be perceived as invasive or even harassment.

However, assuming you're referring to a consensual and gentle interaction between two people in a romantic or intimate setting, here's what might happen:

If a person gently nibbles on a partner's ear (regardless of their species, as elves aren't real, but we'll play along!), the effects would depend on the individual's sensitivity and preferences.

Gentle nibbling can stimulate nerve endings in the ear, potentially causing:

1. **Pleasure**: The sensation can release endorphins, which may create a feeling of relaxation and pleasure.
2. **Tingling**: The ear contains numerous nerve endings, so light nibbling could produce a tingling sensation.
3. **Playfulness**: In an intimate setting, this type of affectionate gesture might spark playful banter or flirtation.
4. **Arousal**: For some individuals, gentle nibbling on the ear can be an erogenous zone stimulus, leading to arousal.

Keep in mind that every person's preferences and boundaries are unique. What one person finds enjoyable or pleasurable might not be the same for another. Respect and communication are crucial in any situation involving physical contact.

3440663146,"A great question about two mainline Protestant denominations! While both Lutherans and Episcopalians have their roots in Western Christianity and share many similarities, there are some notable differences in their doctrines. Here's a summary:

**1. Authority**

Lutheranism (specifically, Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod) places a high emphasis on Scripture alone (sola scriptura) as its sole source of authority. They believe that everything necessary for salvation is contained within the Bible.

Episcopalianism (a part of the Anglican Communion), while also affirming the importance of Scripture, also considers tradition and reason to be complementary sources of authority (in addition to Scripture). This means they place a greater emphasis on the historical context of the early Christian church and the reasoning of prominent theologians.

**2. Sacraments**

Lutherans recognize two sacraments: Baptism and Holy Eucharist (Lord's Supper).

Episcopalians (and Anglicans more broadly) recognize two ""major"" sacraments (Baptism and Eucharist) but also five other ""minor"" or ""lesser"" sacraments: Confirmation, Ordination (or Holy Orders), Penance (Confession), Matrimony, and Anointing of the Sick (also known as Healing Unction).

**3. View of the Lord's Supper**

In Lutheran theology, during Communion (Eucharist), Christ is truly present in, with, and under the bread and wine, which is often referred to as Consubstantiation or sacramental union (a balance between transubstantiation and symbolic views).

In Episcopalian theology, the exact understanding of Christ's presence varies among different members, with some accepting transubstantiation (Catholic view) and others seeing it as largely symbolic. However, most Episcopalians hold a moderate view called Real Presence, where they understand Christ to be genuinely present in the elements, but without fully subscribing to either consubstantiation or transubstantiation.

**4. Clergy Roles**

Lutheranism does not emphasize an elaborate hierarchical structure within their clergy; all pastors (pastors/priests/bishops) serve similar functions. The concept of ordaining women is accepted by most Lutheran synods, although the LCMS does not allow this practice.

In the Episcopalian Church, there exists a three-tiered system, with Bishops having authority over priests (presbyters) who perform local ministry. Women can be ordained as priests and bishops in the majority of episcopal provinces.

**5. Ecumenical relationships**

The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has signed agreements acknowledging full communion (ecclesiastical unity) with various churches including Polish National Catholic Church, some Eastern Rite Catholics, and some Anglican Churches (including Episcopal).

Episcopalianism participates in the Anglican Consultative Council, and Anglican bodies maintain dialogue and interfaith relations through organizations such as the Lambeth Conference, Inter-Anglican Finance and Administration Commission (IAFAC).

These points provide a general overview of some key areas where Lutheranism and Episcopalianism differ in doctrine and practices.",10.16696590764402,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,255.0865249633789

3201207446,"In Classic World of Warcraft, which refers to the original game's balance and content before any expansions were released (also known as Vanilla WoW), determining the ""best"" DPS class or spec for raiding involves considering various factors such as player skill, team composition, encounter mechanics, and current patch notes (for those interested in historical accuracy).

However, across general consensus and historical raid progression reports from that era, here's a brief overview by type:

1. **Ranged DPS:**
   - Warlocks often stand out, particularly with their Affliction spec, due to their ability to maintain consistent damage output over time and provide debuffs like Curse of Elements.
   - Mages could also pack a punch with high single-target nukes, but they suffered more on multi-mob fights compared to Warlocks. Arcane was competitive but not quite at Affliction's level.
   
2. **Melee DPS:**
   - Rogues were highly contested for their extremely high burst potential in PvE environments through stealth and Ambush capabilities, providing significant single-target kills early on in encounters.
   - Hunters provided a hybrid role between ranged and melee capabilities but were mostly considered mediocre when compared purely on a linear DPS output scale against the best rogue builds.

3. **Healing/DPS Hybrids:**
   - While not always the top of the meter due to their other responsibilities, Paladins with Retribution specs (notably the 'hybrid' Ret/Prot spec) could sometimes offer respectable damage numbers alongside their crucial tanking support and Holy Light healing capability.

4. **Caster DPS:**
   - Warlocks had strong AoE (Area of Effect) possibilities through Seed of Corruption and even Rain of Fire. For straight up, raw, single target mage spells like fireball could be used to take down enemies fast on low armor target but not very good vs bosses who were resistant fire element spell due  resistance 
 

Keep in mind that these assessments can vary based on specific scenarios and group synergy. A well-optimized and played character always trumps generalizations about class or spec power levels. Additionally, each class brings unique contributions to a raid beyond just pure DPS, making any class a valuable addition depending on how it fits into the overall team strategy and playstyle.",13.904011432795352,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,185.54560780525208

1558920207,"What a delight! Here's a tale for you:

Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Berlin, there lived a penguin named Percy. Percy was no ordinary penguin – he was a bit of a globe-trotter and had grown tired of his cold and icy home in Antarctica.

One day, while exploring the world, Percy stumbled upon a German travel brochure featuring the vibrant streets of Kreuzberg, a trendy neighborhood in Berlin. The colorful images caught his eye, and before long, he waddled onto a plane (to everyone's surprise!) bound for Germany.

Upon arrival, Percy discovered that the German capital had more to offer than just sausages and schnitzel (although those were quite enticing!). As he waddled through the city, he marveled at the imposing structure of the Brandenburg Gate and cruised along the winding Landwehr Canal.

Despite feeling like a fish out of water (or rather, a bird on ice), Percy quickly won over the hearts of the locals with his charming tuxedo-like feathers and irresistible waddle. Strangers showered him with affectionate stares and even fed him a slice or two of Currywurst.

However, as winter rolled around, Berlin's chilliness proved to be no match for Percy's natural adaptations. Bundled up in a scarf, hat, and a miniature pair of snow boots (a gift from an eccentric tourist), he continued to charm the city's residents as they sipped mulled wine at Christmas markets and watched fireworks light up the night sky.

Eventually, word spread about the lone penguin spotted strolling through Berlin's most iconic landmarks. Local street artists began depicting Percy's escapades in colorful murals, immortalizing his waddling figure amidst iconic symbols like David Hasselhoff (of course!).

As seasons went by, Percy found himself an honorary mascot for this multicultural metropolis. He'd occasionally pop by Café Kalter Kaffeewandertag (Cold Coffee Wanderings), where the friendly baristas would always prepare a tiny cappuccino topped with a dash of whipped cream just for him.

Berlin had captured Percy's heart – and vice versa – making their unlikely friendship a true urban legend and proof that sometimes even in the frostiest corners, the human spirit (or penguin spirit) can find warmth and community.

1769135749,"While the concept of ""privilege"" is often associated with men, it's also important to acknowledge and discuss examples of female privilege that exist in various societies and contexts. Here are some possible illustrations:

1. **Presumption of nurturing abilities**: Women are often expected to be natural caregivers, which can sometimes lead to them being given preferential treatment when it comes to caring for children or elderly parents. This expectation can result in women receiving more support and resources in these roles.
2. **Access to women-only spaces**: Many organizations, such as gyms, networking groups, and social clubs, offer exclusive spaces or services for women only. These environments provide opportunities for women to connect, learn from each other, and find community, without fear of harassment or intimidation.
3. **Tax benefits and financial advantages**: In many countries, single mothers or primary caregivers (usually assumed to be women) receive tax credits or deductions not available to others. Additionally, some governments offer programs specifically targeting women in entrepreneurship or small business ownership.
4. **Healthcare attention and resources**: Research has shown that, on average, women tend to have better access to healthcare services, particularly when it comes to reproductive health, mental health, and domestic violence response systems.
5. **Perceived emotional expression freedom**: Women are generally allowed to express their emotions openly, without facing the same level of criticism or judgment as men. This cultural permission can foster stronger connections and empathy among friends, family, and colleagues.
6. **Social norms favoring women's victimhood**: While problematic in their own right, traditional gender roles sometimes ensure that victims of abuse or crime who are women receive special consideration and protection. For example, many shelters and support services are targeted exclusively towards women survivors of domestic violence or trafficking.
7. **Female-specific educational opportunities**: Various scholarships, grants, and programs aimed at promoting girls' education and women's academic success might be considered examples of female privilege.
8. **Prioritized seat allocations**: Some airlines, public transportation systems, or event venues offer preferred seating or priority boarding options to pregnant women or those with children, which might not always be extended to male passengers.
9. **Favorable media representation**: Mainstream media narratives and entertainment media might portray strong female protagonists, showcasing capable, intelligent, and aspirational characters. While imperfect and sometimes lacking diverse representations, these depictions contribute to positive reinforcement of feminine roles.
10. **Cultural celebrations and holidays**: Celebrations like International Women's Day, Mother's Day, and National Girls' and Women's Sports Days aim to recognize women's contributions and inspire future generations, reinforcing cultural reverence.

Keep in mind that acknowledging examples of female privilege doesn't negate the historical and persistent inequalities faced by women or imply a reversal of power dynamics between men and women. Rather, this perspective aims to promote nuanced understanding of complex societal structures.

In that case, here are some troubleshooting tips to help you successfully complete the mata leão (rear-naked choke) technique:

1. **Check your grip**: Ensure you have a tight and proper grip on uke's chin or neck. A good rule of thumb is to make sure your hand is placed in the ""V"" shape formed by their neck and shoulder.
2. **Hip position**: Verify that you're sitting deeply enough behind uke with your hips, applying pressure to their upper back and shoulders. This will help control their body and prevent them from escaping.
3. **Arm placement**: Check the positioning of your arm across their face and under their chin. Your elbow should be close to their ear, with your forearm applying pressure to their jawline.
4. **Pressure distribution**: Make sure you're applying even pressure to both sides of their neck, using your legs and hips to drive your body weight into the submission.
5. **Finishing the technique**: To increase the effectiveness of the choke, try to squeeze your arms tighter, pulling your elbow towards their ear while maintaining the hip pressure.

If you've checked all these points and still aren't getting a tap, it might be worth trying a few variations, such as:

* Applying more force to one side of the neck
* Shifting your hips slightly to change the angle of the choke
* Using your other arm to apply additional pressure or secure uke's arm

Keep in mind that every person's anatomy is different, so what works for one person might not work for another. It's always essential to train safely and controlledly, respecting your partner's boundaries and tapping early.

One of the most influential scientists who is also a devout Catholic is Frédéric Joliot-Curie, but I'll introduce you to someone even more notable:

**Georges Lemaître (1894-1970)**

Fr Georges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaître was a Belgian priest, astronomer, and cosmologist. He's best known for proposing what's now called the ""Big Bang theory"" (although he didn't use that term). In 1927, Lemaître independently developed the idea that the universe began as a single atom (he called it the ""cosmic egg"") which expanded rapidly around 13.8 billion years ago.

Lemaître's groundbreaking work in astrophysics and cosmology made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe. His hypothesis, initially met with skepticism, later gained widespread acceptance after Edwin Hubble's observations provided supporting evidence.

Throughout his life, Fr. Lemaître remained deeply devoted to his faith and believed that his scientific pursuits were an extension of his spiritual journey. As a Jesuit priest, he argued that science and faith complemented each other perfectly, as they both seek to reveal truth and uncover the mysteries of God's creation.

Other notable Catholic scientists include:

1. **Gregor Mendel** (1822-1884): The Augustinian friar often referred to as the father of genetics.
2. **Renaissance astronomer William Paré** (1574-1629), better known as Johannes Bayer: A Jesuit missionary and mathematician who catalogued over 100 celestial objects and mapped many constellations.
3. **Louis Pasteur** (1822-1895): The famous French biologist and chemist responsible for pioneering germ theory, vaccination techniques, and pasteurization.

These exceptional individuals exemplify the harmonious coexistence of faith and reason in scientific pursuit!

1527545731,"The enigmatic Red Elves, also known as ""Aethon'Dhil"" in their native tongue. This ancient and reclusive subspecies of Elves inhabits the arid, crimson-hued landscapes of volcanic mountains and canyons. Over time, their adaptations to these unforgiving environments have led to distinct physical and cultural traits that set them apart from other Elven kind.

**Physical Characteristics:**

Red Elves stand between 5'8"" and 6'2"" tall, with athletic yet lean builds. Their skin ranges from a warm, golden brown to a deep, fiery red, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their rusty-red surroundings. This peculiar skin tone is not just aesthetically striking but also serves as a natural camouflage, making it easier for them to navigate their perilous homeland.

Their hair often resembles the rich, dark tones of obsidian or polished mahogany, with hints of subtle, fiery undertones. Eyes burn bright like hot coals, with vertical pupils that seem to gleam with inner light. These piercing orbs allow them to see clearly through the harshest sunlight and detect even the smallest changes in their environment.

The Red Elves possess elongated ear tips, which they adorn with intricately crafted, reddish-brown earrings that shimmer with microscopic flecks of gemstone-like minerals found only within their homelands. These decorations hold both ceremonial and functional significance, reflecting their history, achievements, and spiritual connections to their land.

**Cultural and Magical Affinities:**

Red Elves are spiritual beings attuned to the fierce power of their environment. They believe in honoring the primal energies of fire and earth, which govern the ever-changing landscape of their world. Aethon'Dhil magic tends towards fierce elemental manifestations, drawing from these fundamental forces:

1. **Pyromancy:** Masters of blazing passions and consuming flames, Red Elves wield fire as an extension of their will. They summon mighty blazes to purify, scorch their enemies, or forge their famous, gemstone-studded steeds.
2. **Geomancy:** The Aethon'Dhil have developed intimate understanding of the earth's structure and mineral veins. They coax hidden secrets from the very bedrock, fashioning elegant crystalline tools that amplify their magical prowess.

Through shared reverence and connection with their harsh environment, Red Elves form exceptionally close-knit communities. Living cities nestled within scarlet rock formations reflect their harmonious integration with nature:

* Buildings incorporate natural rock outcroppings and tunnel systems
* Geothermal energy is harnessed to fuel innovative smithing techniques
* Ancient carvings adorn cave walls, narrating historical tales and mystical connections

**Warfare and Defense:**

Red Elves are skilled hunters, utilizing their natural affinity for stealth and the land's treacherous terrain to evade or pursue opponents. When combat becomes unavoidable, they engage as precision warriors:

* Expert archers firing arrow-tipped arrows infused with concentrated bursts of flame
* Fierce hand-to-hand combatants, employing martial arts tailored to their agility and strength
* Strategists exploiting their opponents' disorientation amidst a maze of twisting tunnels and jagged boulders

To ensure their people's protection and prosperity, Red Elf cities incorporate an ingenious combination of defense systems:

* Labyrinthine pathways designed to lead intruders astray
* Crystal-laden traps resonant with controlled blasts of intense heat or cold
* Ambuscades arranged across steep ridges or craggy peaks, providing lethal vantage points against invaders

In conclusion, the mysterious and alluring Red Elves embody the fierce balance of harmony with their extraordinary environment. With their potent magical affinities, battle-honed combat tactics, and sophisticated understanding of their unique ecosystem, this captivating sub-species weaves an intricate tapestry that showcases both beauty and ferocity.",14.863846802374217,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,309.4001808166504

3298189994,"Viewing companionship among the elderly, especially when it comes to relationships outside of traditional marriage, can be quite nuanced and context-dependent. As our society continues to evolve and as more people choose non-traditional paths in their personal lives, understanding these dynamics is increasingly important.

For older adults who find themselves single due to divorce, separation, or the loss of a spouse, forming new romantic or companionate relationships can be a source of support and joy. Here's how to approach this topic sensitively and constructively:

1. **Recognize the Benefits**: Companionship at an older age offers many health benefits, including reduced feelings of loneliness and isolation, improved mental and physical health, and enhanced daily function. It can provide emotional support during significant life events and help manage daily tasks through mutual assistance.

2. **Different Forms of Companionship**: Not all companionships lead to marriage or a traditional partnership. Many individuals form strong bonds that serve as emotional support systems, travel partners, or friends with whom they share hobbies or daily activities.

3. **Support Their Decisions**: Respect the choices your elders make about their companionships. Recognizing their autonomy and decision-making capabilities supports their dignity and happiness. Even if their relationship statuses aren't traditional (e.g., living apart together—LAT couples), what's most important is that they feel seen, heard, and understood by those around them.

4. **Open Conversations**: Engage openly but sensitively with your elder loved ones. Understanding their perspective on companionship, intimacy, and aging can offer insight into their changing needs and desires over time.

5. **Resources and Support**: There may be legal considerations or social changes that come with forming new relationships late in life (e.g., estate planning updates, understanding legal rights within unmarried partnerships). Directing them towards appropriate resources or professionals can offer peace of mind and prepare for future challenges.

6. **Social Acceptance and Stigma Reduction**: Help foster a welcoming environment where seniors can explore relationships freely without fear of judgment. Normalizing conversations about aging and love reduces stigma and encourages genuine connections.

7. **Emotional Intelligence and Empathy**: Cultivating empathy towards older adults exploring companionship encourages open communication. Being receptive and supportive during these potentially vulnerable times demonstrates understanding and care.

By approaching these topics with compassion and knowledge, you foster a community that values love, connection, and companionship regardless of age or marital status, ultimately contributing to happier, healthier seniors.",9.370425713316363,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,197.37606954574585

Fascinating question!

Star Trek has been closely tied to participatory culture since its inception in the 1960s. Participatory culture refers to a cultural environment where fans, audiences, or users are not just passive consumers but actively engage with and contribute to the creation of media content.

Here are some ways Star Trek connects to participatory culture:

1. **Fan Fiction**: Long before online communities existed, Star Trek inspired one of the earliest and most extensive fan fiction traditions. Fans wrote and shared their own stories based on the original series (TOS), exploring alternative plotlines, character relationships, and what-if scenarios. This creative expression allowed fans to engage more deeply with the franchise.
2. **Cosplay and Conventions**: Star Trek Conventions, starting with the 1976 New York Comic Convention, provided a platform for fans to share their passion for the franchise through costumes (cosplay). Fans created their own versions of iconic characters, showcasing creativity and dedication to the franchise. Today, cosplay continues to thrive at conventions worldwide.
3. **Letter Campaigns and Save-the-Show Efforts**: When the Original Series faced cancellation in the late 1960s, fans launched letter-writing campaigns to pressure NBC to renew it for another season. Although ultimately unsuccessful, these efforts marked some of the first instances of active participation by fans trying to influence the destiny of a TV show. Similar campaigns have continued throughout the franchise's history, including attempts to ""Save The Original Series"" during its third season.
4. **Amateur Production Teams (APT)**: In the 1980s and 1990s, groups like the Starfleet Academy's APT (also known as TAS productions) created their own Star Trek films, which showcased creative talent and innovative production skills. These works were often distributed through local convention screenings and tape trading circles, exemplifying collaborative, grassroots storytelling.
5. **The Next Generation (TNG) Episode Contest**: During TNG's run (1987-1994), Paramount Television launched a contest called ""Star Trek: The Public Service Announcements,"" encouraging viewers to submit short film scripts that promoted social issues. From 1988 to 1991, fans could submit entries through special promotions. Winners' works were aired as part of episodes and further encouraged audience involvement in shaping the show's social message.
6. **Social Media Engagement**: With the advent of internet platforms, Star Trek creators began leveraging online engagement tools to foster participation among the global fandom:
	* Official Star Trek social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) now solicit input from fans on story development, casting choices, and themes for upcoming episodes and movies.
	* Fan-created memes and viral challenges help spread excitement for new installments.
	* Official podcasts, live streams, and online Q&A sessions allow direct interaction between cast members, writers, producers, and fans.
7. **Community Platforms**: Websites such as Memory Alpha, Reddit's r/StarTrek and r/FanProduction, or YouTube channels dedicated to analysis and reviews (like TrekCore or Science VS) enable shared knowledge building, critique, and discussions about all things Star Trek.
8. **Crowdsourced Projects**: Modern campaigns like ""Bring Back Star Trek Continues!"" demonstrate how committed fans fundraise to support independent productions and sustain beloved storylines outside mainstream outlets.

These participatory endeavors demonstrate that, across various eras and mediums, the Star Trek community remains dynamic and engaged. By actively embracing the collaborative spirit inherent in participatory culture, both official and unofficial factions enrich the expansive franchise's diverse, engaging universe.",11.074911629226293,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,288.2048170566559

3605566747,"In Role-Playing Games (RPGs), especially tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, a ""glancing blow"" typically refers to an attack that hits, but only barely.

When an attacker's roll (often determined by their attack bonus and the defender's armor class) just meets or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), it can result in a glancing blow. Instead of dealing full damage, a glancing blow often inflicts less damage than normal.

The mechanics can vary depending on the specific game system, but here are some general implications:

1. **Reduced damage**: The glancing blow might deal half or quarter damage (e.g., if a sword deals 8 damage normally, a glancing blow might do 4 or 2 damage).
2. **Partial effects**: Certain abilities or spells associated with the attack may not take effect or have reduced potency due to the glancing nature of the hit.
3. **No critical hit**: Even if the attacker would normally score a critical hit (a particularly successful attack), a glancing blow usually doesn't qualify as one.

Glancing blows serve several purposes:

* They reward precision: Glancing blows give players and DMs (Dungeon Masters) more control over combat encounters, as even successful attacks don't always guarantee maximum impact.
* Encourage strategic play: Players must weigh the benefits and risks of pushing for more powerful strikes versus aiming for a safer hit.
* Create tension: Glancing blows add uncertainty, making combat feel more realistic and unpredictable.

Keep in mind that specific rules and implementations may differ between various RPGs.",5.971979298458264,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,129.18130922317505

Jerry and Elaine are at the coffee shop when they see a news report about a prison break, with one inmate still on the loose. Meanwhile, George is walking down the street, wearing a scruffy beard and a fedora, trying to perfect his new "" intellectual"" look.

As it turns out, George's new appearance bears an uncanny resemblance to the escaped convict's mugshot. A vigilant citizen spots him on the street and calls the cops, convinced that she has found the fugitive.

Chaos erupts as police officers swarm around George, attempting to apprehend him. Despite his protests, George is forced to surrender and is taken into custody. Jerry and Kramer try to bail him out, but not before George is booked and thrown in a cell with some shady characters.

Kramer becomes obsessed with being a bounty hunter and sets out to find the real escapee, while Elaine tries to capitalize on the situation by selling ""Free George"" merchandise online.

1671845760,"The scandalous novel! When Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita was first released in 1955, it received both critical acclaim and widespread controversy. Here's an overview of its reception and lasting impact:

**Initial Reception (1955-1958)**

Upon publication, Lolita faced significant backlash due to its explicit subject matter: the obsessive love affair between Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged scholar, and Dolores Haze, also known as Lolita, his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Many reviewers and readers condemned the book for its perceived pedophilia, lewdness, and immorality.

Graham Greene, a British author, initially refused to review Lolita in The Times, but later praised it as ""an absolutely fascinating, wickedly funny"" book. Meanwhile, many others blasted the novel, calling it everything from "" pornographic"" (Time Magazine) to ""a tragic case of authorial self-indulgence"" (Saturday Review).

Some major publishing houses rejected the manuscript due to fear of censorship and moral outrage. However, Olympia Press, a French publisher of pornography and other risqué works, agreed to publish the novel in a limited edition of 3,000 copies.

**Establishing Credibility and Notoriety (1958-1964)**

In 1958, Putnam published Lolita in the United States, which sparked new debates about obscenity laws. Many booksellers chose not to carry the book or kept it hidden behind their counters. Nevertheless, Lolita became a commercial success, reaching bestseller lists, despite (or perhaps because of) the controversy surrounding it.

Academic circles slowly began to appreciate the complexity of Nabokov's prose and the exploration of themes such as obsession, guilt, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. Critics like Kingsley Amis praised Lolita's linguistic and psychological insight into the darker corners of human nature.

**Legacy (1964-Present)**

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Nabokov had gained recognition as one of the preeminent literary figures of the century. As the dust around the initial scandal settled, academia and critics fully recognized Lolita's groundbreaking qualities and profound social commentary:

1. **Postmodernist icon**: Lolita is often regarded as one of the foundational works of Postmodern literature, experimenting with narrative techniques and blurring boundaries between reality, fiction, and identity.
2. **Cultural phenomenon**: Lolita has influenced generations of writers, directors (such as Stanley Kubrick), and artists exploring similar themes and motifs.
3. **Feminism and child abuse discussions**: In recent decades, Lolita's content has led to intense reevaluation, highlighting concerns regarding the portrayal and normalizing of sexualized exploitation of minors.
4. **Classic status**: Lolita is now considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, regularly appearing in Top 100 Novel Lists and receiving continued attention from scholars and general readers alike.

Nabokov himself observed the cultural shift towards acceptance, writing that ""in America, a country with an incredible variety of moral systems...it was quite natural that some critics would praise the virtuous elements, while others attacked the impure.""

Over time, the intense scandal surrounding Lolita's publication subsided, leaving only admiration for Nabokov's innovative genius and mastery of psychological insights – but always maintaining a provocative edge.",8.741913556629289,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,272.7038588523865

2610640078,"A classic tale from the Bible!

The story of Samson and Delilah is found in the book of Judges (chapters 13-16). Here's a brief summary:

**Samson: The Strongest Man**

Samson was a Nazirite, set apart by God before birth as a special leader for the Israelites (Judges 13:1-5). He possessed extraordinary physical strength, thanks to his divine calling and dedication to God.

As an adult, Samson fell in love with a Philistine woman named Delilah, who lived in the Valley of Sorek (Judges 14:1-20). Despite his parents' objections, Samson insisted on marrying her.

**Delilah's Betrayal**

However, their relationship was complicated. Delilah, being a foreigner and not an Israelite, had ties to the Philistine rulers. They offered her wealth and incentives if she could find out the secret behind Samson's incredible strength (Judges 15:1-2).

Delilah repeatedly tried to coax the information out of Samson, but he initially resisted her questioning (Judges 16:4-17). Eventually, after repeated pressure, she wore him down, and he revealed that the source of his strength came from his uncut hair – part of the Nazirite vow he had made to God (Numbers 6:1-21).

Tragically, Delilah shaved off Samson's hair while he slept, rendering him vulnerable without his usual strength (Judges 16:19). She then called the Philistines, who took advantage of the situation and overpowered Samson.

**Consequences and Redemption**

Samson was captured, blinded, and enslaved by the Philistines, where he labored for years grinding grain in a millhouse (Judges 16:21). During this time, however, he prayed for deliverance and forgiveness (Judges 16:25-31).

When the Philistines gathered to celebrate a grand feast at a temple dedicated to Dagon (a false god), they brought Samson as entertainment. He asked to be positioned between two pillars, which supported the roof (Judges 16:26-29). With faith restored and his spiritual strength recovered, Samson pulled the pillars towards himself, collapsing the structure and killing thousands of Philistines, including their rulers (Judges 16:30).

This bold act also freed Samson, who died at the end of the process (some accounts say he deliberately collapsed the building on purpose, sacrificing himself).

Despite the unhappy ending, Samson's heroism and renewed devotion ultimately won praise among the people, earning him recognition as one of the mighty judges of ancient Israel (Hebrews 11:32).

Throughout history, the famous phrase ""She cut his hair"" or simply ""She was a Delilah"" has come to represent betraying someone you care about.

Iceland's beauty was my home before,
But now I bid farewell to icy tides,
And head to Porto, where sunbeams reside.

The Azores high, the wind whispers low,
Of a city old, with secrets to show,
Porto's ancient stones, they whisper tales untold,
Of history rich, in every nook to hold.

From frozen lakes to river Douro's flow,
My journey takes me south, where warmth does glow,
Leaving behind the Northern Lights' pale beam,
To chase the sun-kissed days, in Porto's golden dream.

The city's heartbeat, fast as wine flows free,
A rhythm vibrant, as life bursts with glee,
I taste the Port, with complexity so fine,
As riverside paths weave tales divine.

Cafés and churches, squares so grand and wide,
Stories await in alleyways, side by side,
Azulejo tiles tell stories through design,
Portuguese hearts beat strong, as culture intertwines.

But memories linger still, on foreign ground,
Frozen waterfalls, where echoes all around,
Glimmering Blue Lagoon's soothing shore,
I miss you Iceland's silence, like an ever-roaming core.

While Luis Bridge stretches out its grandeur whole,
Where Vila Nova de Gaia's streets lead way,

1268901284,"Making a grilled cheese sandwich is a simple yet delicious process. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 slices of bread (white or whole wheat, as you prefer)
* 1-2 slices of cheese (such as cheddar, mozzarella, provolone, or your favorite variety)
* 1 tablespoon of butter or non-stick cooking spray
* Salt and pepper to taste (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat your pan or griddle:** Set a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
2. **Butter one side of each slice of bread:** This will help create a golden-brown crust and prevent the bread from sticking to the pan. You can also use non-stick cooking spray if you're watching calories.
3. **Assemble the sandwich:** Place one slice of bread, butter-side down, in the pan or on the griddle.
4. **Add the cheese:** Place one or two slices of cheese on top of the bread in the pan.
5. **Top with the second slice of bread:** Place the second slice of bread, butter-side up, on top of the cheese.
6. **Cook for 2-3 minutes:** Cook for about 2-3 minutes or until the bread develops a light brown crust. You might see the cheese start to melt.
7. **Flip the sandwich:** Carefully flip the sandwich over using a spatula. Press down gently on the sandwich to ensure it's flat.
8. **Cook for another 2-3 minutes:** Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the other side of the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
9. **Check and serve:** Remove the sandwich from the heat and check that the cheese is melted to your liking. If not, cover with a lid and let cook for another minute or two.
10. **Enjoy:** Slice your grilled cheese sandwich and enjoy!

**Tips and Variations:**

* Use different types of cheese combinations, such as cheddar and parmesan or gouda and provolone.
* Add sliced meats like ham or turkey for added protein.
* Spread a layer of jam or pesto on one of the bread slices before adding the cheese.
* Try using a panini press or a grill for a crispy texture.

79299896,"Graham Greene, a renowned British author known for his thought-provoking and morally complex novels, explored various themes in his works, including the pervasive and insidious issue of anti-Semitism. Although not as overtly prominent as some of his other preoccupations, such as Catholicism and politics, anti-Semitism is indeed present in several of Greene's early novels, serving as a subtle yet significant thread in the tapestry of his storytelling.

In ""Brighton Rock"" (1938), one of Greene's earliest major successes, anti-Semitic undertones are detectable, albeit often through suggestion rather than direct statement. The character of Colleoni, a wealthy and influential figure with considerable power over Brighton's underworld, is portrayed as having Jewish ancestry. While not explicitly stated as Jewish himself, Colleoni's past is shrouded in mystery, with whispers among characters hinting at his origins being part of the mysterious and somewhat threatening ""otherness."" This portrayal plays on deep-seated biases prevalent during the time the novel was written, where misconceptions and prejudice against Jews were common in British society. Greene uses this as a backdrop to highlight societal class divisions and moral ambiguities, but also subtly critiques these very prejudices by making Colleoni a multidimensional character, thus undermining simplistic stereotypes.

""The Power and the Glory"" (1940) is another work that, although less directly concerned with anti-Semitism, captures the atmosphere of intolerance and persecution felt by minorities during the tumultuous period it was written in. Set against the backdrop of political upheaval and religious oppression in Mexico during the Cristero War, the novel focuses more on the struggle between religious belief and political reality. However, the themes of prejudice and fear that permeate the novel can also be seen as analogous to the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe during the 1930s and 40s, Greene's way of addressing a broader concern regarding humanity's propensity for hate towards what is perceived as 'different'.

Greene's works from this period, while not primarily focused on anti-Semitism, reflect the climate of their times and offer a nuanced commentary on how prejudice infiltrates societies. Through characters like Pinkie Brown's gang and others, Greene paints a bleak portrait of British seaside towns as hotbeds of petty crime and deep-seated prejudices, highlighting issues that lay just below the surface of British social life, including racism and xenophobia. This critique serves as a cautionary tale, suggesting that these seeds can sprout into more sinister forms when left unchecked.

Moreover, Greene's novels of this era also contain strong themes of compassion and understanding. Characters who might initially seem peripheral or unimportant turn out to hold profound significance, their stories illuminating paths towards redemption and empathy amidst a world torn apart by conflict and distrust. In ""The Ministry of Fear"" (1943), set against the backdrop of World War II's home front in Britain, while anti-Semitism isn't a primary theme, the tension between those perceived as enemies within—like a character believed to have connections to Nazism—is palpably fraught. Yet, the resolution hints at a message of forgiveness and reconciliation, which indirectly comments on the importance of combating prejudice through understanding.

Greene's use of anti-Semitic tropes and stereotypes should be considered within the historical context. Critics argue these representations could perpetuate negative attitudes towards Jews if taken superficially. Nonetheless, given Greene's overall trajectory as a writer grappling with human nature's darker facets and advocating for compassion and love in the face of suffering, these depictions also challenge and complicate these biases.

In conclusion, while not the central focus of Greene's early novels, anti-Semitism emerges as a subtextual element. Greene tackles the subject matter subtly, using it as part of a larger exploration of societal fears, religious identity, and the dangers of prejudice. Through the medium of fiction, he invites readers to examine these biases closely and to seek understanding beyond them. Given the tumultuous time period in which they were penned, these early works demonstrate an awareness of and engagement with the rising specter of hatred that spread across Europe and elsewhere during the first half of the 20th century.",13.563472780996664,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,330.51426434516907

1241871515,"In team sports, it's not always straightforward to assign an individual player's Elo rating, as the outcome of a game depends on the performance of the entire team. However, I'll outline some common approaches used to estimate individual player Elo scores:

1. **Team-based approach**: Assign a single Elo rating to the team and use the results of their games to update the rating. This approach assumes that each player contributes equally to the team's overall strength.
2. **Weighted contribution**: Allocate a percentage of credit for each game outcome based on each player's perceived impact. For example, if a star player is considered responsible for 30% of their team's success, they would receive 30% of the rating change (in terms of both wins and losses).
3. **Expected Possession Value (EPV)**: Measure each player's value by analyzing how their possessions contribute to their team's expected score. By estimating EPV, you can calculate a weighted average rating for each player based on their possession usage and impact.
4. **Player-Game Rating System (PGRS)**: Introduce individual weights for each player in a game. After the match, adjust these weights to reflect their performance. Players who outperform expectations gain more value than those who underperform.
5. **Win Probability Added (WPA)**: Attribute changes in the win probability throughout the course of a game to individual players' actions. The change in WPA after each play allows for a better understanding of individual player contributions.
6. **Regression analysis**: Use linear regression or other statistical models to predict game outcomes based on historical data. Include player-specific variables like efficiency ratings or past performance to capture their influence.

Keep in mind that no single method fully solves the challenge of estimating individual player Elo scores. Combining different approaches might yield more robust estimates.

Here's an example of how you could apply these methods:

Let's say we want to approximate an individual player Elo rating using a team-based approach with weighted contributions.

| Player | Weighted Contribution |
| John   |.3                    |
| Mike   |.25                   |
| Sarah  |.45                   |

* Team Elo: 1000
* Pre-game probabilities against the opponent:
	+ Team (John, Mike, Sarah): Win probability 60%, Lose probability 40%
	+ Opponent: Win probability 40%, Lose probability 60%

Assume the actual result: Team (John, Mike, Sarah) wins with an Elo rating change of +32.

Updated Elo rating:
* John (.3 x 32 = +9.6)
* Mike (.25 x 32 = +8)
* Sarah (.45 x 32 = +14.4)

This way, you approximate the updated Elo ratings for John (to 1009.6), Mike (to 992), and Sarah (to 1068).

2523549271,"(speaking in a hushed tone) Alright, sir/ma'am, listen up! Given the rain, this could actually play to our advantage against the top pro. They're used to playing on pristine courses with perfect conditions, but we can adapt and make some smart decisions to take them down.

First, let's assess the situation:

* We're playing from behind, so we need to be aggressive.
* The rain is softening the greens, making it easier to control spin.
* Our opponent might be more cautious to avoid mistakes.

Strategy for Eagle 1:
We have a good shot at getting an eagle on hole 7, the par-5 (500 yards). With the rain reducing the roll of the ball, I recommend taking out a driver-5-iron approach instead of trying to bomb one onto the green. This will give us a shorter distance to attack the pin, which should sit up nicely, making a chip-in eagle attempt possible.

For the second shot, choose a high-lofted hybrid or fairway wood to prevent overspin on the wet rough. A gentle swing should help us find a soft landing area just short of the green.

Eagle 2 Opportunity:
On hole 13, a downhill par-4 (350 yards), the rain makes this hole a prime target for a long approach shot. Since the pros tend to hit their drives farther than us mortals, they might feel like going for broke here. But we'll employ a sneaky trick: aim for the rough about 30 yards right of the fairway bunker. A lucky break could see our ball kicked back into the short grass near the green!

Play your natural fade, and if you clip it cleanly, the shot will draw up closer to the pin as the ground becomes sopping wet. From that range, with a bit of luck and skill, another chip-in or short putt could give us another eagle!

Now, remember, these plans come with risks and variables beyond my control – still, given the rainy circumstances, these bold moves might increase our chances against the favored player.

What do you think? Do either of these ideas sound like something you'd want to execute today?",10.608838595254763,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,175.1755039691925
2523186442,"In the Jewish tradition, a Bar Mitzvah (for boys) or Bat Mitzvah (for girls) is a significant coming-of-age ritual that marks a child's transition from adolescence to adulthood in the eyes of the community.

**What happens during a Bar/Bat Mitzvah:**

Typically, the ceremony takes place when a boy turns 13 years old (Bar Mitzvah) or a girl turns 12 or 13 years old (Bat Mitzvah), depending on the customs of their specific Jewish community. The celebration can vary among different Jewish denominations, such as Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or Reconstructionist.

On the day of the Bar/Bat Mitzvah, the youngster:

1. Leads part of the Shabbat service (a weekly worship service)
2. Reads from the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) or a portion of it
3. Receives the privilege of participating fully in synagogue rituals for the first time
4. Is acknowledged by the congregation as an adult member of the Jewish community

The event usually includes a kiddush (a meal or reception) afterwards, where friends and family gather to celebrate the new ""adult"" with food, music, and gifts.

**Significance in Jewish Tradition:**

The Bar/Bat Mitzvah signifies several important milestones:

1. **New responsibilities:** As a result of reaching bar/bat mitzvah age, the young person becomes responsible for fulfilling the commandments (mitzvot) of Judaism.
2. **Transition to adulthood:** This rite of passage acknowledges the child's growth into a more mature individual who has reached physical and emotional maturity, marking their transition into adulthood.
3. **Assuming a role in the community:** By participating actively in synagogue rituals, the Bar/Bat Mitzvah takes on a more active role within the Jewish community and assumes new privileges and responsibilities.
4. **Confirmation of identity:** The Bar/Bat Mitzvah confirms the young person's commitment to their Jewish heritage and spiritual development.

**Key differences between Bar and Bat Mitzvah:**

Historically, girls were not formally recognized as coming of age in Jewish communities until relatively recently. Today, the Bat Mitzvah ceremony has evolved, but some traditions still differ from Bar Mitzvah ceremonies:

* Girls' participation might include reading from the Torah or leading prayers
* In some Conservative or Reform congregations, girls may participate fully, while in Orthodox communities, separate roles may be assigned
* Dates and practices may vary depending on local custom and denominational practices

In summary, Bar/Bat Mitzvahs represent a joyous milestone in a young Jew's life, symbolizing their arrival at a stage of responsibility, self-awareness, and spiritual readiness to participate as a member of the Jewish community.

106536315,"While it's impossible to shield children from everything, there are certain sights that can be disturbing, frightening, or even emotionally damaging for them to witness. Here are some examples of things that children may not be ready to see:

1. **Graphic violence**: Avoid exposing children to violent scenes, gruesome images, or harm inflicted on people or animals.
2. **Mature or suggestive content**: Children shouldn't watch movies, TV shows, or online videos with mature themes, explicit language, or suggestive behavior, including romantic or intimate content.
3. **Abuse or domestic violence**: Witnessing physical or emotional abuse can traumatize a child and potentially desensitize them to the seriousness of such situations.
4. **Traumatic accidents or natural disasters**: Sudden, violent, or traumatic events like car crashes, fires, or natural disasters can be overwhelming for children and evoke lasting fears.
5. **Gore or medical procedures**: Graphic depictions of surgery, injury, or death can cause anxiety, nightmares, or phobias in young children.
6. **Explicit or disturbing news coverage**: Be mindful when kids are present during newscasts; try to avoid exposure to upsetting stories or footage, as they might find it unsettling.
7. **Animal cruelty or suffering**: Avoid showing children scenarios where animals are harmed, mistreated, or show signs of distress.
8. **Self-harm or suicidal behavior**: This topic requires careful handling and should ideally be addressed through age-appropriate discussions with trusted adults.
9. **Nudity or explicit content**: Young children may not fully comprehend what they're seeing, but prolonged exposure can lead to curiosity or unhealthy attitudes toward their own bodies or others'.

Dr. Who, also known as the Doctor, is the main character in a British sci-fi television program called ""Doctor Who."" The show has been on the air for over 50 years, with various actors playing the role of the Doctor.

According to the show's mythology, the Doctor is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through time and space in his iconic ship, the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space). The TARDIS looks like a blue police box on the outside but is much larger inside.

Each incarnation of the Doctor is a different aspect of the same person, regenerating when close to death or old age. This regeneration process allows the show to recast the lead actor every few years, which has resulted in 13 different Doctors so far!

Here's a brief rundown of each Doctor:

1. William Hartnell (1963-66) - The original and First Doctor
2. Patrick Troughton (1966-69) - The Second Doctor, played as a more playful and eccentric version

8. Paul McGann (1996) - The Eighth Doctor, appearing in the movie
9. Christopher Eccleston (2005) - The Ninth Doctor, marking the revamped series' reboot
10. David Tennant (2005-2010) - The Tenth Doctor, gaining huge popularity and critical acclaim

2499430351,"The age-old debate about beauty standards! As a helpful personal assistant, I'd like to offer a balanced perspective on this topic.

While these three items (makeup, high heels, and miniskirts) can be fun and empowering for some individuals, it's essential to emphasize that their value lies in individual preference, cultural context, and self-expression – not as necessities for validation or self-worth.

That being said, here are some points to consider:

**Makeup:**

1. **Self-expression:** Makeup can be a creative outlet and a way to express one's personality through colors, styles, and artistry.
2. **Confidence boost:** When applied tastefully, makeup can enhance natural features and help individuals feel more confident in their appearance.
3. **Personal style:** Makeup can be an integral part of one's daily routine, just like choosing a hairstyle or outfit.

However, it's crucial to remember:

* You are beautiful with or without makeup.
* Natural features should be celebrated and not covered up unnecessarily.
* Overemphasis on makeup can lead to unhealthy beauty standards and unrealistic expectations.

**High heels:**

1. **Special occasions:** High heels can add glamour and sophistication to formal events, making you feel elegant and put-together.
2. **Cultural significance:** In some cultures or social settings, high heels are seen as a symbol of femininity, luxury, or power.
3. **Personal taste:** Some people simply enjoy wearing high heels as a fashion statement or for their own satisfaction.

Keep in mind:

* Comfort is essential; prioritizing your physical well-being is just as important as looking good.
* Wearing high heels excessively can lead to discomfort and potential health issues (e.g., back pain, foot problems).
* Flats, sneakers, or other comfortable shoes are perfectly fine choices too!

**Miniskirts:**

1. **Femininity and confidence:** Miniskirts can make some women feel feminine, playful, and confident, especially when worn as part of their personal style.
2. **Fashion expression:** Skirt length is just one aspect of fashion; it's okay to experiment with different styles and silhouettes.
3. **Expression of creativity:** Fashion is an art form, and skirts – regardless of length – can be a fun way to showcase personality.

It's essential to acknowledge:

* Modesty is subjective; what matters most is feeling comfortable in your clothes.
* Self-respect and self-acceptance come from within, not from revealing clothing.
* Personal boundaries and body positivity should be respected by oneself and others.

To summarize:

These items are optional, personal choices that shouldn't define one's worth, identity, or self-esteem. Beauty standards are diverse, and what makes someone else feel beautiful or empowered may not apply to everyone.

Encouraging young girls (and everyone!) to prioritize:

1. **Body positivity:** Embracing their unique shape, size, and features.
2. **Comfort:** Choosing clothing and accessories that make them feel relaxed and at ease.
3. **Individuality:** Embracing their own tastes, preferences, and styles without pressure from external sources.
4. **Authenticity:** Not trying to conform to societal beauty norms if it doesn't resonate with their true selves.
5. **Empowerment through inner values:** Focusing on qualities like kindness, empathy, intelligence, and resilience as defining characteristics.

2471866784,"Harmony is indeed one of the most fascinating and fundamental aspects of music, and understanding why it sounds the way it does can help you appreciate its beauty even more.

In short, harmony in music sounds the way it does because of the way our brains process and respond to multiple pitches sounding simultaneously. When two or more notes with different frequencies (pitches) are played together, their waveforms overlap, creating new patterns and sensations that our minds interpret as harmonious or dissonant sounds.

There are several factors at play here:

1. **Frequency Ratios:** The relationship between the frequencies of adjacent notes determines whether they sound consonant or dissonant. Harmonic intervals, like perfect fifths and octaves, have simple frequency ratios (e.g., 2:3 for a perfect fifth), which creates a sense of stability and coherence. More complex ratios often produce tension and dissonance.
2. **Timbre:** The distinct tone quality (or timbre) of each instrument contributes to the overall sound of the harmony. Think about how different instruments ""blending"" their unique tone colors affects the harmonies we hear. For example, the warmth of a cello complements the brightness of a violin.
3. **Interference Patterns:** As I mentioned earlier, when multiple waves overlap, they create interference patterns that affect how we perceive the combined sound. These patterns can result in beatings (a pulsing effect when frequencies clash) or reinforce desired harmonic tones.
4. **Cultural Conditioning:** Our subjective response to harmonies is influenced by cultural background, musical traditions, and individual experiences. What we consider harmonious may vary significantly from culture to culture and person to person!
5. **Cognitive Processing:** Our brains constantly organize sound information into patterns, including hierarchical structures (like chords and melodies) that influence what sounds pleasing or unsettling.

These elements combine to shape the sonic landscape of harmony, resulting in an incredible variety of possibilities – from sweet, resonant thirds to jarring, discordant clusters.

Now, let's put these principles into practice! If you'd like, I can suggest some fun experiments or online tools where you can explore harmony creation and get a feel for these concepts yourself.

**Title:** ""Pokémon: Legacy of the Ancients""

**Synopsis:** In a world where humans and Pokémon coexist, but with a much more complex and darker relationship, ""Pokémon: Legacy of the Ancients"" delves into the mature themes of identity, power struggles, and the true cost of ambition.

The story takes place in a gritty, industrialized version of the Pokémon universe, where trainers have become CEOs of massive corporations that exploit Pokémon for their powers. The plot follows our protagonist, Auguste (a former member of the Elite Four turned whistleblower), as she uncovers a sinister conspiracy involving a powerful artifact known as the ""Ancient Egg."" This relic has the potential to control the very fabric of reality and bend time itself.

Auguste must navigate the treacherous underworld of Pokémon trafficking, corrupt politicians, and rogue scientists who seek to misuse the Ancient Egg's incredible power. Along the way, she teams up with a ragtag group of allies, including a battle-hardened detective named Ryder and a reclusive Pokémon researcher named Lena, each with their own demons to face.

As they delve deeper into the mystery, they'll encounter legendary Pokémon driven mad by human greed, Pokémon that have developed sentience and formed secretive cabals to protect themselves against humanity's destructive impulses. These sentient Pokémon will challenge everything Auguste thought she knew about her world and the very nature of her relationships with these creatures.

Will Auguste be able to prevent a catastrophe of biblical proportions and uncover the truth behind the Ancient Egg? Can she redeem herself after past transgressions and restore balance between humans and Pokémon before it's too late?

As an Indian sissy, you might face unique cultural or societal expectations, but remember that being true to yourself is essential. Here are some tips to help you on your journey:

1. **Get to know yourself**: Understand what makes you feel feminine and comfortable. Is it dressing up in certain clothes, trying out makeup, or engaging in activities traditionally associated with women? Experiment and find what works for you.
2. **Indian aesthetics**: Take inspiration from traditional Indian clothing and beauty standards. You could incorporate lehengas, sarees, salwar kameez, or kurtis into your wardrobe. Explore the world of bindis, henna art, and other Indian beauty customs.
3. **Feminine grooming**: Develop a skincare routine and take care of your hair. Learn how to style it in ways that make you feel confident and feminine. You could try various hairstyles, like braids or ponytails.
4. **Makeup tutorials**: Watch online tutorials catering specifically to Indian skin tones and features. Practice different looks, from natural enhancement to glamorous styles. You might consider investing in a few products that suit your skin type.
5. **Embodying femininity**: Channel your inner diva through posture, body language, and mannerisms. Walk with confidence, practice elegance, and work on softening your facial expressions.
6. **Supportive communities**: Seek out online forums, social media groups, or local organizations that celebrate LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly sissies and feminine-presenting men. Share experiences, learn from others, and build connections.
7. **Cultural understanding and respect**: Remember that India is a diverse country with varied traditions and values. Be respectful of cultural boundaries while embracing your own identity. Educate yourself on the importance of cultural sensitivity and avoid appropriating aspects that don't resonate with you personally.
8. **Come out (if desired)**: When ready, share your feelings with trusted friends, family, or a professional counselor. Having support can be incredibly empowering as you continue to explore your sissy side.

810246688,"Learning chess openings efficiently requires a strategic approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you make the most of your study time:

1. **Understand the basics**: Before diving into specific openings, review basic concepts like piece development, control of the center, and pawn structure.
2. **Choose a repertoire**: Focus on a limited set of openings (4-6) that fit your style and level of play. You can select openings based on:
	* Your favorite pieces or pawns structures
	* Popularity among players with similar ratings
	* Recommendations from chess coaches or online resources
3. **Start with the fundamentals**:
	* Learn the main ideas behind each opening, including typical moves, transpositions, and responses
	* Study master games and try to understand thought processes behind their moves
4. **Organize your knowledge**:
	* Create a database or notebook with key lines and variations for each opening
	* Categorize lines as:
		+ Main lines: well-established and popular options
		+ Side lines: less common but still playable alternatives
		+ Rare/Novelty lines: unusual or untested options
5. **Analyze master games**: Observe how grandmasters play out these openings in tournament games. Pay attention to:
	* Strategic decisions (e.g., pawn structure, piece placement)
	* Tactical considerations (e.g., pins, forks)
	* Endgame transitions
6. **Practice regularly**:
	* Play against different opponents or online engines (e.g., Stockfish) with these openings
	* Review your own games, focusing on improving decision-making during the opening phase
7. **Use online tools and apps**:
	* Websites: Chess.com, Lichess.org, or ChessBase offer tutorials, videos, and articles
	* Apps: Stockfish (engine), Chess24 (analysis), and Opening Master (database)
8. **Work through chess books and DVDs**:
	* Classic texts: ""My 60 Memorable Games"" by Bobby Fischer or ""How to Reassess Your Chess"" by Jeremy Silman
	* Modern guides: ""The Sicilian Defense"" by Sam Collins or ""Attacking Manual"" by Vladimir Vukojevic
9. **Stay up-to-date**:
	* Follow top tournaments and super tournaments
	* Subscribe to newsletters (e.g., Chess.com's News Brief)
10. **Consult with stronger players or a coach**: Discuss your opening choices, game plans, and performance with more experienced players or coaches to identify areas for improvement.

Additionally, here are some advanced tips to boost your efficiency:

* Create a routine, dedicating a fixed amount of time each day/week to studying and practicing openings
* Set realistic goals (e.g., mastering one new opening per month)
* Mix and match different sources (books, videos, online tools) to keep learning engaging
* Don't be afraid to try different openings; switching between them will improve overall understanding and adaptability
* Develop critical thinking by trying to come up with alternatives or anticipating responses while studying opening lines.

Remember, mastering openings is not just about memorizing moves, it's also about understanding fundamental principles and applying creative, analytical thinking.

2119410467,"If childhood lasted twice as long, it's likely that the effects on individuals and society as a whole would be profound. Here's a hypothetical exploration of what might happen:

**Positive outcomes:**

1. **Slower maturation**: Children might develop physically, emotionally, and cognitively at a slower pace, allowing for more gradual transition to adulthood. This could lead to:
	* Better impulse control
	* More developed emotional regulation
	* Increased empathy
2. **More time for play and curiosity**: A longer childhood would provide ample opportunities for children to explore, experiment, and learn through play, which is essential for cognitive development.
3. **Reduced pressure and stress**: With more time to grow up, youngsters might feel less pressure to achieve milestones or perform academically, potentially reducing anxiety and stress levels.

**Challenges and potential drawbacks:**

1. **Delayed independence**: As a result of a protracted childhood, young adults might take longer to assert their independence, potentially delaying entry into higher education, employment, or entrepreneurship.
2. **Increased cost and resource strain**: Extended childhoods could put an additional burden on families, social systems, and economies, as caregivers and governments might need to support these extended youthful periods.
3. **Changes in family dynamics**: Parents and caregivers might face significant adjustments as they balance responsibilities, financially and emotionally, with older children who still rely heavily on them.
4. **Potential negative impact on productivity**: An extended childhood might reduce the number of productive years during which individuals contribute to society through work, leading to economic implications.

**Possible societal adaptations:**

1. **New educational paradigms**: To cope with a lengthier childhood, educators and policymakers might focus on developing new teaching methods and curriculum designed for longer developmental periods.
2. **Shifts in career paths and expectations**: As a result of delayed entry into the workforce, industries might adapt by focusing on adult training and upskilling programs, or redefine notions of 'early career' stages.
3. **Rethinking parenting styles and cultural norms**: Societies may place greater emphasis on fostering independence and self-sufficiency skills earlier in life, adjusting cultural attitudes towards parenting and child-rearing.

Of course, this is speculative, and actual results might vary widely depending on a multitude of factors. Nevertheless, this thought experiment sparks intriguing questions about human development and societal consequences if our formative years were indeed prolonged.

Now, what do you think would be some benefits and drawbacks of extended childhoods from your perspective? I'd love to discuss!",7.885131502060119,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,204.0024905204773

2725766876,"Who can resist the classic combo of fish and chips? Here's a delicious recipe to make your taste buds dance:

**British-Style Fish and Chips Recipe**

**Ingredients:**

For the Fish:

* 4 pieces of white fish (such as cod, haddock, or halibut), about 1 inch thick
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
* 1 cup buttermilk
* Vegetable oil for frying

For the Batter:

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup cornstarch
* 1/2 cup ice-cold soda water
* Vegetable oil for frying

For the Chips (Fries):

* 2 pounds potatoes, peeled
* Vegetable oil for frying
* Salt to taste

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the fish:** In a shallow dish, mix together flour, paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Pour the buttermilk into a separate dish.
2. **Dredge the fish:** Coat each piece of fish in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Dip the floured fish in the buttermilk, making sure it's fully coated. Roll in the flour mixture again, pressing gently onto the fish to ensure it adheres evenly. Set aside on a plate.
3. **Make the batter:** In another bowl, whisk together the batter ingredients until smooth. Gradually add the soda water and stir until you get a light, airy consistency. The batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
4. **Fry the fish:** Heat a large saucepan with at least 1-2 inches of vegetable oil over medium-high heat (around 350°F). Once hot, dip one of the battered fish pieces in the batter, then carefully place it in the hot oil. Fry for about 3-4 minutes, until golden brown. Flip the fish over and fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, until cooked through. Repeat with the remaining fish pieces.
5. **Fry the chips (fries):** Meanwhile, peel and cut the potatoes into long strips (about 1/2 inch thick). Rinse them under cold running water to remove excess starch, then dry thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the same saucepan used for frying the fish (with a small amount of clean oil) to around 300°F. Fry the chips in batches until crispy, about 3-4 minutes per batch. Drain excess oil and sprinkle with salt to taste.

**Assembly and Serving:**

1. Warm up some malt vinegar (traditionally used in British fish and chip shops) or substitute with lemon wedges for serving.
2. Place the fried fish on a tray lined with paper or parchment paper (for a crispy bottom).
3. Arrange the crispy fries alongside the fish.
4. Serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley or dill if desired. Enjoy!

Tips:

* For a crisper crust on the fish, chill the battered fish in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before frying.
* Use a thermomoter to ensure proper oil temperature (175°C/350°F) for perfect frying results.
* For extra crispy fries, try soaking the cut potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes, patting dry with paper towels after frying.

741315085,"Creating a walking bass line is an excellent way to add movement and interest under chord progressions, especially in jazz settings. Here's how you can develop a simple walking bass line over the provided chord progression:

1. **Cm7 (4 beats)**:
   - Beat 1 & 2: Start on the root note (C), then move up chromatically or diatonically. For simplicity, let's use a diatonic approach moving up to E(b).
   - Beats 3 & 4: Resolve down to G (a diatonic note within C minor) for tension release.

2. **F7 (4 beats)**:
   - Beat 1: Move up from the previous resolution (G), so start with A.
   - Beat 2: Progress to B for some tension, as it leads smoothly into the next part of our walk.
   - Beat 3: Hit the major third (A natural) since we're dealing with F7, keeping the harmonic integrity but also focusing on movement.
   - Beat 4: Descend to F for resolution before the chord change.

3. **BbM7 (4 beats)**:
   - Beat 1: Come off the F (which was the last note of F7), stepwise up to G, utilizing what feels like a slight delay or anticipation of the chord change.
   - Beat 2: Land on Ab (creating a small amount of dissonance that will be resolved next beat due to its relation with the key of Bb major.
   - Beat 3: Resolve tension by going up to A or simply using Ab's adjacent, D (part of Bbmaj scale and sounds richer).
   - Beat 4: Approach the fifth or another strong note without feeling too rigidly structured; I've picked Db here due to its harmonically consonant feeling leading us through nicely into the upcoming change.

4. **EbM7 (4 beats)**:
   - Beat 1: From Db resolve downwards onto Eb, making use of the resolution after reaching for those higher notes
   - Beat 2: Go up chromatically (you could ascend via G or any other colorful neighbor tones to introduce intrigue)
   - Beat 3: Resolve onto G (to prepare Eb chord progression stability back down on beat four),
   - Beat 4: Play with this cadence's end and decide where you want that cadential effect

Now combining all these steps would yield something akin to a bass line structure over your chords. The beauty lies not just in sticking strictly to these but improvising variations within these parameters too:

``` 
Starting at E over Cmin and then navigating towards Ab resolving neatly onto Bbmaj creating a satisfying rhythmic-harmonical dance between the melodic line.
```
Feel free to experiment and adapt according to your musical composition needs or desired style/genre-specific feel!

1087278538,"The classic holiday movie Home Alone (1990)! Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin, indeed exhibits several heroic attributes throughout the film. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Resourcefulness**: When Kevin is accidentally left behind by his family during the chaos of their Christmas vacation preparation, he shows incredible resourcefulness in fending for himself. He uses everyday household items to create a makeshift breakfast (pizza with microwave-heated cheese) and finds ways to entertain himself without adult supervision.

Example: Kevin uses a Talkboy tape recorder as a toy phone to order pizza, showcasing his cleverness and adaptability.

2. **Bravery**: Despite being only 8 years old and facing a daunting situation, Kevin demonstrates remarkable bravery when confronted by two bumbling burglars, Harry and Marv (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern). He cleverly outsmarts them at every turn, using booby traps and quick thinking to defend his home.

Example: When Kevin realizes the burglars are trying to break into his house through the front door, he rigs up a slippery ice-covered porch and sets a swinging paint can trap to deter them.

3. **Self-reliance**: Without any external help, Kevin takes care of himself and finds ways to maintain the household, even learning to do simple tasks like laundry and cleaning.

Example: Kevin successfully cooks a frozen pizza in the oven, demonstrating his ability to fend for himself and accomplish basic tasks on his own.

4. **Cunning and tactical thinking**: Kevin employs clever strategies to outwit the burglars, always staying one step ahead of them. This demonstrates his quick thinking and analytical mind.

Example: When Harry and Marv try to break in through the attic window, Kevin uses glue to stick their shoes to the floor and creates a swinging ladder trap to slow them down.

5. **Ingenuity**: Kevin consistently uses creative problem-solving skills to overcome obstacles, often repurposing ordinary objects in innovative ways.

Example: By attaching marbles to the stairs and slipping a wet iron onto the steps, Kevin effectively prevents the burglars from navigating the staircase.

6. **Protective instincts**: Despite being just an 8-year-old kid, Kevin feels responsible for safeguarding his home and defending it against the intruders. His love and loyalty towards his family drive him to take bold action.

Example: When Kevin realizes the burglars have finally broken into the house, he uses his cunning and booby traps to chase them away, putting himself between danger and his beloved home.

2682646905,"The concept of Meritocracy refers to a social or economic system where rewards, opportunities, and privileges are distributed based on individual merit, ability, or talent rather than wealth, birthright, or privilege.

In a meritorious society:

1. **Ability is the primary criterion**: Decisions about who gets what job, education, or promotion are made based on qualifications, hard work, intelligence, and demonstrated skills.
2. **Open competition**: Individuals have equal access to opportunities and resources, allowing them to compete with others to achieve their goals.
3. **Talent-based advancement**: Progression through careers, leadership positions, or academic hierarchies depends on performance, achievements, and dedication.

Meritocratic systems aim to promote fairness, efficiency, and social mobility by:

* Fostering innovation: By recognizing and rewarding innovative ideas and solutions
* Encouraging hard work: Providing incentives for individuals to develop their skills and capabilities
* Reducing inequality: By recognizing talent over heredity, wealth, or privilege
* Building trust: Creating a perception of fairness in decision-making processes

However, some criticisms and concerns around meritocracies include:

* **Bias and stereotypes**: Unconscious biases can influence judgments of an individual's ""merit"" or potential
* **Systemic inequalities**: Historical advantages or disadvantages may limit opportunities, creating uneven playing fields for marginalized groups
* **Elitism and exclusivity**: Meritocracies might prioritize competitive, high-achieving individuals, leaving others feeling excluded
* **Misattribution of success**: Success may be attributed solely to individual effort rather than external factors like luck, networking, or cultural capital

To balance these concerns, some advocate for a more nuanced approach that recognizes both individual efforts and structural barriers:

* **Contextualizing meritocracy**: Considering socio-economic factors and offering support programs to level the playing field
* **Comprehensive education**: Emphasizing education as a way to recognize diverse forms of knowledge and abilities
* **Encouraging critical thinking**: Teaching individuals to think critically about power structures, biases, and systemic issues that affect decisions

2404091941,"(smiling humbly) Ah, the Master Blaster - Sachin Tendulkar. (pausing to reflect) You know, I've always looked up to him as an idol. Growing up, watching him play was like a cricketing education for me. His techniques, his shot-making, his mental toughness... he's a true legend of the game.

( leaning back in my chair)

I still remember the way he used to take on even the toughest bowlers with confidence and authority. His hunger for runs, his passion for the game... it was simply inspiring. And what can I say about his record-breaking career? The highest number of centuries, the highest run-aggregate in both ODIs and Tests... (smiling) I mean, who else but Sachin can do that?

But what I admire most about Sachin is not just his cricketing prowess but also the humility and simplicity with which he carries himself. Even at the height of his success, he remained grounded and connected to his roots. A true role model for all aspiring cricketers, including myself.

(pausing briefly)

As a captain, I had the privilege of leading him in a few matches towards the end of his career, and let me tell you, it was an incredible experience. To see the dedication, the hard work, and the willingness to learn from someone who has already achieved so much... it's something I'll always cherish.

(smiling fondly)

Even though we come from different eras and have different styles of playing, I think our approach to the game is quite similar. We both value hard work, discipline, and team effort above everything else. Maybe that's why we got along well off the field too. (laughs)

3934965551,"The Romantic period, spanning from roughly 1800 to 1910, was marked by a rich and expressive musical landscape. Composers during this era favored harmonies that were lush, intense, and emotionally charged. Here are some chord progressions and types commonly used during the Romantic period:

1. **Minor Chords with Added Seventh**: The use of minor seventh and fully diminished chords (with their root, minor third, perfect fifth, and minor or diminished seventh) added complexity and depth to music.

2. example: Cmaj7 - G7(b9) - Am7

3. (ii-V-I): This progression, often seen as ii7-V7-I, became a staple of many works. It involved the supertonic (ii), dominant (V), and tonic (I), providing a sense of tension and resolution.

4. Example: Dm7 - A7 - Cmaj7

5. **French Sixth and German Sixth Chords**: Also known as enharmonic chords, these created a sense of drama through dissonance resolving into consonance.

6. (vi-IV-V-I) and (vi-iii-vi-ii): These progressions capitalized on the emotional depth provided by the relative minor's somber mood, leading through different keys' colors before resolution.

Examples:
- vi-IV-V-I: Am-F-G-C
- vi-iii-vi-ii: Am-Em-Am-Dm

7. **Pedal Points and Ostinatos**: Techniques like holding a bass note as a pedal point while changing harmonies above it, or repeating patterns (ostinatos), were used for emphasis or dramatic effect.

Example: In Chopin's Nocturnes (like Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 55, No. 1), there's a prominent use of pedal points and arpeggiated chords.

8. **Extended Dominants**: Expanding beyond traditional V-I, composers frequently moved through sequences like V/vii°-vii°/III-V-VII-V, adding more color to their works.

Example: dmin7 - Ebdom7 - Abdim - Bbmaj7 - Dbmaj7

9. **Chromaticism and Enharmonic Changes**: Chromatic scales and passages were used extensively in the Romantics works to add tension and expressiveness.

10. Example: A section using extensive chromatics is often seen in Franz Liszt's piano pieces.

These chord progressions and techniques reflect only a part of the innovative spirit of harmony and composition during the Romantic era but offer a glimpse into its musical richness and complexity.",9.9498743710662,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,214.81130027770996

816232616,"I'd like to introduce ""Triple Threat Showdown,"" a fast-paced, strategic dice game designed specifically for three players.

**Objective:**
The goal of the game is to score points by creating pairs and runs with the numbers rolled on the three dice. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!

**Materials:**

* 3 six-sided dice
* A flat surface or table to play on
* Pencils/pens and paper for scoring (optional)

**Gameplay Overview:**
A typical turn consists of rolling the dice, identifying possible combinations, and choosing which combination to score.

**Setup:**
Each player sits around the playing area, and one player volunteers to roll the dice first (player 1). Players can take notes or keep track of their scores as they go along.

**Turn Order:**

1. **Rolling:** Player 1 rolls all three dice.
2. **Identifying Combinations:** Look for valid combinations:
	* Pair: Two or more identical numbers (e.g., two 4s or three 4s)
	* Run: Three consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.)
	* Wild Card: When a player rolls a 1, they can choose any number from the remaining two dice as a pair or run (this will be explained later).
3. **Choosing a Combination:** Based on the identified combinations, player 1 decides whether to:
	* Score a Pair (2 points for each match)
	* Score a Run (5 points for three sequential numbers)
	* Score the Wild Card (if a 1 was rolled) – This option allows player 1 to score points for either a Pair or Run by declaring what the Wild Card (1) represents.
4. **Recording the Score:** Write down the scored combination (pair or run) and the corresponding points.
5. **Next Player:** The next player in line (player 2) becomes the new active player and repeats steps 1 through 5.
6. **Game Length:** The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds (agree upon before the start), or when one player reaches a set target score (20, 30, etc.).

**Additional Rules and Clarifications:**

* If no valid combinations are found, the turn passes to the next player without scoring any points.
* A player cannot reuse the same combination (Pair or Run) that has already been scored.
* In cases where multiple combinations are available, the player must choose only one.
* The game rewards strategy, so think carefully about which combination to score and how it may impact future opportunities.

Get ready to roll! You and your friends will have fun trying to create high-scoring combinations while navigating these simple yet engaging mechanics. Enjoy Triple Threat Showdown!",7.817821708279663,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,232.3653428554535

The Age of Order occurred approximately 25,000 years ago and lasted for about 4,000 years. It was a period marked by the rise of order and civilization among the night elves on the continent of Kalimdor. During this time, the ancient night elf empire under the leadership of Azshara and the Highborne began to organize their society into cities and castles.

Unfortunately, their attempts at creating a highly structured society also led to growing arrogance and an excessive use of arcane power, which ultimately attracted the attention of Sargeras - The Dark Titan - leading to his corrupting influence over Azshara and her councilors, setting off a chain of catastrophic events that would unfold into the War of the Ancients.

2468956968,"In Spanish, verbs can be quite complex when it comes to conjugation.

A typical Spanish verb has around 60-80 distinct forms or conjugations in the present, preterite (past), imperfect, and conditional tenses for different subject pronouns like ""I"", ""you"" (informal/formal), ""he/she/it"", ""we"", ""they"", etc.

Here's a rough breakdown:

* Present tense: 6 (1st singular, 2nd singular informal/familiar, 3rd singular, 1st plural, 2nd plural formal/familiar, 3rd plural)
* Preterite (simple past): 6
* Imperfect (past continuous): 6
* Conditional (present and perfect): 6
* Subjunctive moods (present and imperfect): 4-6 (depending on the context)
* Future and conditional periphrastic (using auxiliary verbs like ""ir + a""): variable
* Progressive forms (using estar + gerunds or estar en -iendo/-yendo): 6

Keep in mind that some irregular verb patterns, like decir, caber, and hacer, may have slightly more or fewer conjugated forms. Additionally, compound tenses (like the preterite anterior or pluscuamperfecto de indicativo) will also add more forms, but these aren't as commonly used.

So, all in all, you could say a typical Spanish verb has between 50 and 100 distinct conjugated forms, depending on how you count them. Don't worry, though – with practice, you'll become more comfortable using these conjugations!",6.457050290342517,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,136.66183352470398
2080422840,"To calculate a slightly negative split for a 10K in 36:59, I'll break down the course into smaller segments and assign corresponding splits.

A 10K is equal to 10000 meters or approximately 6.2 miles. For simplicity, let's divide it into:

1) The first half (5000m / 3.1 miles): 
   - Aiming for a slightly negative split implies you want to be marginally slower on the second half. Given your target time, if we distribute it linearly, we'd have:
     - First half time ≈ 18:30
     - Second half time ≈ 18:29

However, for precision and considering you might not maintain an exact consistent pace throughout, let's further break this down into mile splits. This will provide a more realistic expectation of how pacing might vary during an actual run due to factors like terrain changes, runner fatigue, and psychological factors.

For a general guideline, here's how the splits could look like:

- Mile 1: Fast start with a bit of excitement and energy = 5:40
- Miles 2 & 3: Settling into a comfortable rhythm after the initial rush = 5:50 each
- Miles 4 & 5: Start feeling comfortable enough to increase speed lightly but also beginning to anticipate the halfway point = 5:45 each
- Halfway (Mile 3.1), so adjust the midpoint to reflect slightly faster than average = 18:30 exactly (for a rough calculation)

- Second half (also 5 miles):
  - Mile 6: Coming off the slight boost from hitting the halfway mark = 5:40
  - Miles 7 & 8: Starting to feel some strain but trying to maintain consistency around the pace set earlier = 5:42 each
  - Last two miles getting increasingly tough as endurance starts to wane, but pushing through the final stretch: 
    - Mile 9: 5:55
    - Mile 10 (last 600 meters counting towards finishing strongly): 6:05 plus the last few strides at a sprint

Given these adjustments, here are the calculated splits and estimated finish time:

**First half:** 18:30
   - Mile 1: 5:40
   - Mile 2: 11:30
   - Mile 3: 17:20
   - 3.1 miles: 18:30 (Halfway)
   
**Second half:** 18:29
   - Mile 4: 23:12 (5:40+18:30+1second adjustment)
   - Mile 5: 28:54
   - Mile 6: 34:26
   - Final 0.5km: End at 36:59

These splits are just suggestions and serve as guidelines. Actual performance can vary significantly based on training, conditions, and individual strengths/weaknesses.",12.368132795451727,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,245.15039992332458

**Braised Adult Ram Ribs Recipe (serves 4-6)**

Ingredients:

* 1 kg adult ram ribs
* 20g coarse salt
* 10g black peppercorns
* 5g brown sugar
* 2 tbsp olive oil (30ml)
* 1 large onion, chopped (250g)
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced (15g)
* 200ml red wine (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot)
* 400ml lamb or beef broth

Instructions:

1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat your oven to 180°C (with fan assistance).
2. **Prepare the ribs:** Rinse the ribs under cold running water, pat them dry with paper towels, and season with coarse salt, black peppercorns, and brown sugar.
3. **Sear the ribs:** Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat (190°C). Sear the ribs until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the ribs from the pot and set them aside.
4. **Soften the onions:** Reduce heat to medium (150°C) and cook the chopped onion in the same pot until softened, translucent, and lightly caramelized (about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally).
5. **Add aromatics and liquid:** Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, then add the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low (100°C) and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. **Return the ribs and braise:** Return the browned ribs to the pot, cover with a lid, and transfer it to the preheated oven. Braise the ribs for 2 hours and 30 minutes at 180°C (with fan assistance), or until the meat is tender and easily falls off the bone.
7. **Finishing touches:** After 2 hours, carefully remove the pot from the oven and pour in the lamb or beef broth. Simmer the mixture over low heat (100°C) on the stovetop for an additional 30 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

Serve the deliciously braised adult ram ribs hot, garnished with fresh parsley or thyme, if desired. Enjoy!

Please note that you can also slow-cook these ribs using a slow cooker: simply sear and brown the ribs as instructed, then transfer everything to a slow cooker with the remaining ingredients and cook on Low for 8-10 hours.",2.349441992440115,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,224.57585072517395
555339916,"For those who may not know, Michael van Gerwen is a professional darts player from the Netherlands, widely regarded as one of the greatest in the sport's history. Here's a potential Clash Royale card design inspired by ""Mighty Mike"":

**Card Name:** The Bullseye Sniper (Van Gerwen)

**Type:** Legendary Troop Card

**Appearance:** The card features an illustration of Michael van Gerwen in mid-throw, with his iconic red hair and focused expression. His arms and legs are extended, as if he's releasing a dart.

**Stats:**

* Elixir Cost: 6
* Health: 3500
* Damage: High (similar to the Electro Dragon)
* Speed: Medium
* Range: Long-range
* Target: Single enemy troop or building

**Special Ability:** ""The Winning Shot"" - Deals 150 damage to a random enemy troop or building within range every second for 3 seconds after deployment. Also increases the card's attack speed by 30% during this time.

**Additional effects:**

* When deployed, The Bullseye Sniper gains a temporary shield absorbing up to 10% of its maximum health, making it more resistant to counterattacks.
* If The Bullseye Sniper takes down an enemy tower, there's a 25% chance that all enemy troops within its attack range take 100 damage.

**Tactics and Synergies:**

* Pair The Bullseye Sniper with tanky troops like Giants or Golems to draw enemy fire while you wait for the sniper to take aim.
* Use The Bullseye Sniper to soften up enemy defenses before deploying a swarm card like Hog Rider or Goblin Barrel.
* To maximize the effect of ""The Winning Shot,"" play The Bullseye Sniper when multiple enemy troops are clustered together.

**Strengths:**

* High damage output against single targets
* Decent health pool
* Can take out clusters of troops quickly
* Increased attack speed and accuracy can be game-changing

**Weaknesses:**

* Vulnerable to counterspells or high-damage area-of-effect spells (like Lightning or Rocket)
* Relatively expensive elixir cost
* Limited to targeting a single troop or building at a time

Overall, The Bullseye Sniper would excel as a precision-oriented legendary card capable of taking out specific high-priority targets or weakening enemy defenses with its long-range attacks.

1995112271,"The art of creating a sourdough starter from scratch! Here are the 7 simple steps to follow:

**Day 1: Create the Spontaneous Starter**

1. **Mix flour and water**: In a clean glass or ceramic container, combine 1/2 cup (120 ml) of warm water (around 90°F to 100°F / 32°C to 38°C) with 1/2 cup (60 g) of whole wheat or all-purpose flour.

**Day 1-6: Feed the Starter**

2. **Cover and let sit**: Cover the container with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm, draft-free place for 24-48 hours. This is the beginning of fermentation.
3. **Feed the starter (Days 2-6)**: Discard half of the mixture and add another 1/2 cup (120 ml) of fresh water and 1/2 cup (60 g) of fresh flour. Repeat this process every 24 hours for the next 4-5 days. You'll start to notice bubbles and a slightly tangy smell – these are signs that your starter is coming alive!

**Establishing Your Sourdough Starter**

4. **Look for froth and bubbles (around Day 4-5)**: After feeding your starter daily, you should see it begin to bubble, expand, and have a slightly sour aroma. Congratulations, your natural yeast and bacteria colonies are taking over!
5. **Adjust feeding schedule (around Day 5-6)**: Once your starter is bubbly and active, you can reduce the feeding frequency to once every 12 hours or even less often (e.g., just before bed).

**Ready to Bake (around Day 7)**

6. **Final feed and rise (1-2 hours)**: Before using your starter, give it one last feeding (1:1 ratio) and wait 1-2 hours for it to become even more active and almost doubled in size.

7. **Storing your mature starter**: Congratulations, your sourdough starter is now mature and ready to use! Transfer it to an airtight container and store it in the fridge (covered). Feed it regularly (every 1-2 weeks) to keep it alive.

Tips:

* Use filtered water (or non-chlorinated water) for the best results
* Avoid using distilled or tap water high in chlorine
* Store your starter at room temperature (away from direct sunlight) during the first few days to facilitate natural fermentation
* Don't worry if your starter looks too liquid or chunky initially; it will settle into a creamy consistency as it matures",5.935951586352539,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,219.74955463409424

873826859,"The sun beat down on the sandy floor of the Colosseum, casting a golden glow over the thousands of spectators who had gathered to witness the day's main event: a battle to the death between two of Rome's greatest gladiatorial champions, Titus ""The Titan"" and Victor ""The Victorious."" The air was electric with tension as the crowd chanted and cheered for their favorite fighter.

In one corner of the arena, Titus stood confidently, his powerful legs spread wide apart as he flexed his muscles in preparation for battle. His skin glistened with oil, making his bulging biceps and rippling chest look like they were carved from marble. He wore a suit of gleaming steel armor adorned with golden accents, his red cape fluttering behind him like a banner.

On the opposite side of the arena, Victor cracked his knuckles and sneered at Titus across the distance between them. His physique was just as impressive as his opponent's – broad shoulders, massive arms, and a defined midsection that seemed honed from years of intense training. A crimson stripe ran along the top of his helmet, which matched the fierce glint in his eye.

As the games' editor raised his hands for silence, the crowd hushed in anticipation. The combatants gave each other disdainful looks before facing the dais where the emperor and high-ranking officials sat, awaiting the signal to begin.

With a grand flourish, the games' editor dropped his handkerchief into the sand, signaling the commencement of battle. Titus and Victor advanced towards each other, their swords raised and eyes locked.

For a moment, the opponents circled each other warily, sizing up weaknesses and potential openings. Titus feigned a lunge to Victor's left flank, only to quickly recover and strike out at Victor's right. Victor parried the blow easily and launched a counterattack that forced Titus to jump back several feet.

Titus grumbled under his breath at the successful counterattack but swiftly countered with a flurry of short jabs aimed at Victor's face and neck. Victor covered himself well with his shield and responded by unleashing a storm of heavy, crashing blows designed to wear Titus down.

Each hit found its mark, landing solidly against Titus' shield or helmet, causing sparks to fly when metal met metal. The air filled with the clangs and crashes as the two warriors traded devastating strikes, neither able to gain an upper hand.

Despite Victor's ferocity, however, Titus remained confident and controlled, measuring each swing carefully to pinpoint the perfect timing for a fatal strike. Finally, spotting his chance, Titus risked everything by shifting his stance and striking upwards beneath Victor's shield, hoping to find his way past Victor's defenses.

Victor sensed danger at the last second and barely managed to lift his sword to deflect the attack, giving Titus time to recover his posture and unleash another powerful swing that struck Victor squarely in the center of the chest.

A collective gasp rose from the audience as Victor stumbled backwards, his movements momentarily hampered by shock. His expression changed rapidly from confidence to confusion as he desperately struggled to maintain balance.

Not wasting any opportunity to press his advantage, Titus sprang towards Victor with lightning-fast speed, pinning him against the wall of the arena with his own sword pointing towards Victor's heart. For what felt like an eternity, the crowd watched as Titus savoring his victory, then plunged the blade home with calculated force.

Time froze as Victor crumpled onto his knees, blood splattering the nearby sands as Titus stood victorious over his shattered rival. With triumphant roar echoing through the stadium, Titus raised his sword aloft as if embracing destiny's favor and declared ""Ego sum Invictus!"" (I am the Unconquered).",10.196030309213873,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,312.03031277656555

In the Dune series by Frank Herbert, Paul Atreides (also known as Muad'Dib) does not actually die in the classical sense. However, I can provide you with some information on his eventual fate.

**Spoiler alert!**

At the end of ""Dune Messiah"" (the second book in the series), Paul's prescience and ability to see into the future have grown so overwhelming that he realizes the only way to escape the burden of his visions and prevent the downfall of humanity is to disappear into the Fremen sietches and become one with the sands of Arrakis.

Paul deliberately blinds himself by exposing his eyes to the intense heat and light of the twin suns on Arrakis, rendering him sightless but also freeing him from the visions that have haunted him. He then disappears into the Fremen culture, leaving behind the legend of Muad'Dib.

His disappearance allows for a kind of spiritual transcendence, where he becomes part of the ecology and cycles of the desert planet. In many ways, this ending is more a transformation than a death, as Paul merges with the natural world of Arrakis and lives on through his Fremen heritage.

However, if you're looking for a more definitive answer about the eventual death of Paul Atreides' physical body... **Book three: ""Children of Dune"" contains hints about his eventual passing**:

According to various interpretations and accounts within the books, it's implied that Paul's blind self wandered the deserts, ultimately becoming a revered and mythic figure among the native Fremen. In an unofficial explanation given by Brian Herbert (Frank Herbert's son and co-author of the prequel/sequel novels), Paul may have disappeared and ultimately died alone, but the date or circumstances aren't fully explored in the original trilogy.

The details surrounding Paul's final years remain ambiguous, reflecting Frank Herbert's emphasis on the character's spiritual evolution rather than focusing solely on traditional plot progression.

While some argue for Cristiano Ronaldo or Diego Maradona, the consensus among many is that Lionel Messi stands head and shoulders above the rest as the greatest soccer player to ever step onto the pitch. With his unparalleled skillset, incredible work ethic, and numerous accolades, Messi has solidified his position as the GOAT.

Firstly, Messi's sheer talent is unmatched. The Argentine maestro possesses a combination of speed, agility, balance, and vision that sets him apart from any other player. His ability to beat defenders with ease, create scoring opportunities out of thin air, and find the back of the net with precision is uncanny. Whether it's dribbling past opponents with his quick feet, sending precision passes through packed defenses, or unleashing thunderous shots from outside the box, Messi's mastery of the ball is awe-inspiring.

Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has consistently demonstrated his dominance on the field, earning numerous individual awards and breaking countless records. He holds the Guinness World Record for most goals scored in a calendar year (91), most Ballon d'Or awards (7), and most UEFA Best Player in Europe awards (3). These accolades serve as tangible evidence of his dedication and excellence.

Messi's impressive trophy cabinet further solidifies his status as the GOAT. As a member of FC Barcelona, he won 10 La Liga titles, 4 UEFA Champions League titles, 3 Copa America trophies, and 1 Olympic gold medal. Notably, his team's victory in the 2019-2020 season marked their sixth domestic title in eight years – a testament to Messi's continued relevance and excellence at the top level.

One of Messi's most compelling qualities is his humility and commitment to continuous improvement. Despite being considered one of the best players of all time, he continues to evolve as a player and strive for greatness. Under the guidance of Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique at Barca, Messi learned to reinvent himself as a team player, utilizing his incredible skills to contribute to the greater good. This selflessness not only earned him recognition but also reflected his true value to the game.

Additionally, Messi's international performances showcase his consistent brilliance across various levels. His record against top-ranked teams demonstrates that he can rise to any challenge, showcasing incredible poise under pressure. When called upon by his national side, Argentina, Messi responds with exceptional displays, spearheading his country to two Copa America finals (2008, 2016).

Comparing him to fellow contender Cristiano Ronaldo highlights Messi's remarkable staying power. Both have consistently played at the highest level over several seasons; however, Messi's durability and longevity set him apart. Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has endured relatively fewer injuries compared to his peers and shown remarkable resilience despite the wear-and-tear caused by constant games and training sessions.

Lastly, while individual success accounts for much of his standing as GOAT, his leadership role in shaping Barca into a dominant force cannot be overstated. From leading the attack, creating opportunities, and adapting to different systems, Messi became more than just the focal point – he inspired teammates and fueled club success. 

Ultimately, any doubts about Lionel Messi's standing as GOAT can be quieted by reviewing his impressive resume: an unparalled combination of natural talent, hard-won victories, and unforgettable memories etched in history books. Even his contemporaries recognize him as 'a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon,' making it impossible for others to keep pace.",10.529883564068397,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,292.2172791957855
2766116256,"In chess, the fastest possible checkmate is called ""Fool's Mate"" and it can happen in just two moves!

Here's how to achieve it:

1. White: f4
Black: e5
2. White: g4 (mate)

More formally, the correct notation would be:

2933175188,"In Role and Reference Grammar (RRG), the analysis focuses on the semantic roles of entities involved in an event or state described by a sentence, as well as their syntactic expression. Let's break down the sentence ""I am a cat"" using RRG:

1. **Semantic Roles:**
   - The sentence involves two main participants:
     - **The speaker** (marked as 'I'): This is the first-person singular pronoun indicating the entity referring to themselves.
     - **A cat**: This refers to the category or class that the speaker claims to belong to.

2. **Syntactic Structure:**
   - **'I am'** serves as the linking phrase connecting the subject ('I') with its predicate nominative ('a cat'). 
   - **'A cat'** functions as the predicative nominal (the part after 'am'), providing information about the subject.

3. **Argument vs. Predicate Linking:**
   - The subject 'I' would be considered the argument (in this case, also an actor but not acting upon anything) linked directly through the verb ""am"" which acts as a linker here rather than indicating an action.
   - The role of ""being a certain way"" or more specifically in RRG terms being characterized by something else ('a cat') makes 'I' have an undergoer-like role because it receives a characterization, which in simple clauses can sometimes blur into more abstract semantic roles due to lack of typical activity.

4. **Clausal Structure and Clause Nucleus**
   - **Clausality and Event Representation:** Despite lacking a clear causality or agency action typical of active sentences, we see a basic statement structure without direct involvement, focusing instead on defining a quality (here identity/state-of-being). 
   - **Nuclear Juncture (or not?) in Semantically Less Active Statements:** Even though 'to be' verbs (like ""is"", ""are"", ""am"") serve as nuclear elements for describing equivalences in predications such as 'X is Y', here we could discuss whether in such less complex and typically very core-level linking situations they represent a true juncture, as the emphasis lies clearly on defining'me' akin somewhat similar to an existentive function (""There exists"").

However, analyzing further might depend heavily on how you categorize these kinds of ""be"" (stative or equative, and even existential) structures within a grammar theory since sometimes these don't fit cleanly with typical categories derived mostly from examining action-oriented constructions.

If looking deeper into the matter through linguistic philosophic or metaphysical lenses beyond strictly structural or functional roles it seems clear how this could easily branch towards complex conversations on self-definition, social constructionism and epistemology depending on contexts provided prior or in accompanying discussions - although that exceeds mere sentence roles examination",15.812339753988821,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,232.1594123840332

* 4-5 medium-sized potatoes (preferably high-starch potatoes like Russet or Idaho)
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup of sour cream (can be replaced with Greek yogurt for a lighter version)
* 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise (optional, but traditional)
* Salt and black pepper to taste
* Chopped fresh parsley or dill for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. Boil the potatoes until they're tender when pierced with a fork. Drain and let them cool.

3. In a separate pan, heat some oil and sauté the chopped onion over medium heat until softened and translucent.
4. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, being careful not to burn it.
5. In a large bowl, combine the cooked and cooled potatoes, sautéed onion mixture, salt, and black pepper.

Imagine being part of a tight-knit research team in the frozen vastness of Antarctica, where the isolation is as breathtaking as the scenery. But when an alien creature, disguising itself as one of your own, infiltrates your camp, the boundaries between reality and paranoia become terrifyingly blurred.

That's the premise of John Carpenter's 1982 masterpiece, ""The Thing."" When American paleontologist R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) discovers a mysterious Norwegian base camp covered in blood and gore, he unwittingly unleashes a shape-shifting monstrosity that assimilates and perfectly imitates human form – skin cells, memories, and all.

As the ""thing"" begins to pick off MacReady's team members one by one, suspicion turns friend against friend in a battle for survival. Tensions escalate as trust becomes a luxury no one can afford, with no way to distinguish genuine humans from their extraterrestrial doppelgangers.

Carpenter's innovative use of practical effects – courtesy of master special effects artist Rob Bottin – creates a gruesome yet mesmerizing array of creatures born from fevered nightmares: grotesque distortions, tentacled mutations, and other unsettling abominations born from the very bodies of the crew themselves.

Will anyone make it out alive, or will they succumb to the paranoia-fueled fear that has gripped them? The tension builds towards a claustrophobic finale that cements ""The Thing"" as one of horror cinema's most gripping thrill rides. With its groundbreaking visuals and suspenseful plotting, Carpenter's classic continues to evoke the perfect blend of terror and fascination – you'll question everything you thought you knew about humanity, identity, and what it truly means to be ""you"".

2969168899,"The 38th President of the United States was Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr., also known as Jerry Ford.

Here's a brief rundown on him:

**Biographical Information**

Gerald Ford was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Leslie Lynch King Sr. and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King. He was initially named Leslie Lynch King Jr., but his parents later divorced, and he was adopted by his stepfather, Gerald R. Ford, whom his mother married when he was just two years old.

Ford studied at the University of Michigan, where he played football and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics. He then attended Yale Law School and earned his law degree (LL.B.) in 1941.

**Presidential Term**

Gerald Ford served as Vice President under Richard Nixon from October 12, 1973, until August 9, 1974, when Nixon resigned amidst the Watergate scandal. Under Section 2 of the 25th Amendment, Ford became the 38th President of the United States upon Nixon's resignation, serving from August 9, 1974, until January 20, 1977.

**Key Policies and Accomplishments**

During his presidency, Ford implemented several notable policies:

1. **Pardoning Nixon**: Ford controversially pardoned Nixon for any crimes related to Watergate.
2. **Vietnam War withdrawal**: Ford ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
3. **Post-Watergate Reforms**: Ford signed legislation aimed at improving government transparency, such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.
4. **Energy Crisis Response**: In response to an energy crisis triggered by the Yom Kippur War, Ford established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stockpile oil and signed the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act.

Despite these efforts, Ford lost the 1976 Republican presidential primary to Ronald Reagan and went on to lose the general election to Jimmy Carter.

**Personal Life and Later Years**

Gerald Ford passed away on December 26, 2006, at age 93. His legacy is often overshadowed by his role in the Nixon administration's downfall, but many credit him with helping to heal the country during a tumultuous period.

2964563985,"Cooking a delicious duck filet in the oven sounds like a great idea! Here's a basic guide to help you achieve a perfect dish:

**Preparation:**

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Rinse and pat dry the duck filets with paper towels.
3. Season the filets with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs or spices (e.g., thyme, rosemary, garlic powder).

**Simple Oven-Roasted Method:**

1. Place the duck filets on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
2. Drizzle with a small amount of oil (e.g., olive, avocado, or grapeseed) to prevent sticking.
3. Roast the duck filets in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes per pound, or until they reach an internal temperature of:
	* Medium-rare: 130°F - 135°F (54°C - 57°C)
	* Medium: 140°F - 145°F (60°C - 63°C)
4. Use a meat thermometer to ensure accurate temperatures.

**Additional Tips:**

1. For crispy skin, increase the oven temperature to broil (high heat) for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning.
2. If you want a more caramelized crust, sprinkle some sugar or honey on top of the duck filets before roasting.
3. You can also add aromatics like onions, carrots, and celery to the baking sheet for added flavor.

**Timing:**
Here's a rough estimate of cooking times based on the weight of the duck filets:

* Small filets (6 oz/170g): 10-12 minutes
* Medium filets (8 oz/225g): 14-16 minutes
* Large filets (12 oz/340g): 18-22 minutes

Remember to let the duck rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute, making the meat even more tender and flavorful.

Enjoy your perfectly cooked duck filet!

Taylor Swift wrote an opinion editorial for the WSJ on August 25, 2019, titled ""Music Meets the Moment: My Rights as an Artist"". In the article, she discussed ownership of one's master recordings and the music industry's changing landscape.

The main topic was about Scooter Braun (a music manager) acquiring her former record label Big Machine Label Group, which owned her master recordings from her first six albums, for $300 million.

Swift expressed concern that she didn't have control over her master recordings, wasn't given the opportunity to purchase them herself, and worried about how this deal could affect future musicians trying to own their work.

She also mentioned Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Label Group, breaking his promise to give her the option to purchase her master recordings before selling the company.

In summary, Taylor Swift used her platform to highlight important issues regarding artist rights, music ownership, and control over one's creative output in the ever-changing music industry landscape.

3700426648,"Spoiler alert!

The multiple endings of Nier: Automata can be confusing, but I'd be happy to help clarify.

There are actually 26 possible endings in the game, which can be overwhelming! However, these can be broadly categorized into five main endings (A-D), and then further branched out into several other variations.

**SPOILER AHEAD**

Ending ""E"" specifically refers to one of the final endings you can unlock after completing the game's story cycles. To get Ending E, you need to complete certain conditions:

1. **Get all the other endings**: Unlock all the other main endings (A-D) and most of their variant branches.
2. **Meet the requirements for each route**: Ensure you've completed every character's storyline and side quests.
3. **Have the correct save data**: The game needs to detect that you have completion data from previous routes stored on your device.
4. **Start a new playthrough with specific settings**: Start a fresh run on Hard mode or higher, without any prior save data carried over.

Once you meet these conditions, you'll encounter a unique prompt when selecting your starting pod ( Adam or Eve). This prompts you to delete your old save data, unlocking a **New Game+** option.

Upon accepting the New Game+ option and choosing to delete your saves, the game will effectively start anew. Your goal is to make different choices and progress through the game, experiencing alternate paths and plot developments. Eventually, this leads you toward Ending E.

Nier and his companions become aware of the looping reality they're trapped within, and by breaking the cycle, the entire world collapses. In Ending E, we see 9S find Adam and decide what happens next... 

Please note: getting to Ending E requires substantial gameplay time and repetition; multiple playthroughs and experimentation might be needed.

Vegemite is a savory, umami-rich spread made from yeast extract, which is a byproduct of beer brewing. The original recipe was developed in Australia in the early 20th century, and it quickly became a beloved national icon. The name ""Vegemite"" comes from combining ""veggie,"" short for vegetable (to emphasize its natural origins), and ""Marmite"" (a popular UK brand of yeast extract at the time).

The spread has a thick, dark brown paste-like consistency and a distinctive strong flavor that's often described as salty, malty, or umami. It's usually spread thinly on toast, crackers, or sandwiches, often paired with butter or avocado.

Despite being an acquired taste, Vegemite has gained popularity worldwide, particularly among health-conscious individuals due to its high nutritional value: it's rich in vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9 (folate), B12, and other essential nutrients like copper, iron, and selenium.

**Instructions:**

1. **Prep the wings:** Rinse the chicken wings and pat them dry with paper towels.
2. **Season with spice mix:** In a bowl, mix together flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Toss the chicken wings in the spice mixture to coat evenly.
3. **Fry the wings:** Heat about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F (190°C). Carefully add a few wings at a time (do not overcrowd) and fry for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Repeat with remaining wings.

As I'm not capable of predicting the future with certainty, I'll rely on past performances, team statistics, and recent trends to make an educated guess.

Here's my analysis:

**Head-to-Head:** South Africa (Bafana Bafana) has played Nigeria (Super Eagles) 13 times in international matches. Nigeria leads the head-to-head count with 8 wins, while South Africa has won 3 games, and 2 have ended in draws.

**Current Form:**

1. **South Africa**: After a decent performance in the AFCON 2021 qualifiers, where they topped their group, Bafana Bafana faced some rough patches. In their last five games, they've lost twice (to Ghana and Zambia), won twice (against Ghana and Lesotho), and drawn once (with Seychelles).
2. **Nigeria**: The Super Eagles have been inconsistent as well. They secured two convincing wins against Lesotho and Benin in the Nations Cup qualifiers but dropped points against Sierra Leone. Their latest friendly against Cameroon ended in a draw.

**Key Stats:**

1. Both teams tend to concede goals easily (averaging around 1 goal per game conceded).
2. South Africa relies heavily on counterattacking football.
3. Nigeria boasts talented attacking players like Victor Osimhen (5 goals in his last 10 games for country) and Leicester City's Kelechi Iheanacho (7 goals in his last 11).

**Prediction:**
Given these facts, here's my hypothetical take:

Both teams will approach this high-stakes match cautiously. South Africa might opt for defensive solidity and aim for counterattacks. Nigeria will probably try to capitalize on set pieces and pinpoint passing to exploit South Africa's weaknesses at the back. 

Considering these factors, I predict:

* Total Goals Scored: Under 3
* Match Outcome: Draw or Nigeria win by a single goal
* Best Odds Offered:
	+ Double Chance (South Africa + Nigeria): Underdog SA @ 4/1 (Oddschecker)
	+ Over 2.5 Goals @ Evens (Bet365)

I believe you're referring to Saint Bernadette Soubirous, also known as Bernadette of Lourdes!

Bernadette was a French Catholic nun who lived in the 19th century (1844-1879). She is best known for her visions of Our Lady of Lourdes (also known as the Virgin Mary) at the Grotto of Massabielle near Lourdes, France.

As a young girl, Bernadette experienced a series of apparitions between February 11 and July 16, 1858, where she claimed to have seen a lady dressed in white, which she believed to be the Blessed Mother. During these apparitions, Bernadette reported that the Virgin Mary instructed her to dig in the dirt, revealing a hidden spring. The water from this spring is now famous for its alleged healing properties and has become a popular site for pilgrimage at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes.

Bernadette's visions were initially met with skepticism by local officials, but eventually gained credibility after a series of miraculous events, including the cure of several illnesses through prayers and bathing in the newly discovered water.

After much persuasion, Bernadette finally revealed the location of the apparition site, the Grotto of Massabielle, which became a shrine and place of worship.

Eventually, Bernadette entered a convent and spent the rest of her life serving as a Sister of Charity and Living Bread at Nevers, where she passed away at the age of 35 due to complications related to tuberculosis.

She was beatified in 1925 and canonized a saint in 1933 by Pope Pius XI. Today, Bernadette is remembered as the ""Lourdese"", or messenger of Lourdes, and her story has inspired millions around the world.

1409658822,"The infield fly rule! One of the most nuanced and often misunderstood rules in baseball.

In simple terms, the infield fly rule is designed to prevent the defense from intentionally dropping an easy pop fly in order to turn a double or triple play on a batter who hits a ball with less than two outs and runners on first and second base (or bases loaded).

Here's how it works:

1. **There must be less than two outs**.
2. **Runners must be on first and second base (or bases loaded)**.
3. **The batter hits a fair ball that, in the umpire's judgment, is catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort.**

If these conditions are met, the umpire will call ""infield fly"" or ""infield fly rule"" as soon as the ball is hit, usually before the play unfolds.

Once the rule is invoked:

* The umpire raises their arm to signal that the infield fly rule is in effect.
* The batter is automatically out, regardless of whether the ball is caught or not.
* Runners can attempt to advance at their own risk; if they do, they can be tagged out or forced out like normal.

The key point is that the batter is already out when the rule is called, but the play still develops naturally after that. Umpires use their discretion to determine what's an ""ordinary effort"" for an infielder to catch the ball, which can sometimes lead to disputes over whether the rule was applied correctly.

Overall, the infield fly rule aims to maintain fairness and integrity in the game, preventing teams from exploiting an easily exploitable situation.

250930207,"The Sicilian Defense!

The Sicilian Defense is one of the most popular and aggressive chess openings, used by Black to counter White's 1.e4 (King's Pawn opening) move. It starts with:

1.e4 c5

By playing...c5, Black aims to challenge White's central pawn on e4 and prepare for a strong center. The Sicilian Defense offers many variations, some of which lead to very complex positions.

There are several main lines and sub-variations within the Sicilian Defense, but here are the basic ideas:

* The Open Sicilian (1...c5): This leads to sharp play, with Black aiming to attack White's position with...d6 or...g6, while White focuses on quick development.
* The Closed Sicilian (1...c5 d3): This line features a more positional style, where Black delays immediate confrontation with d4-d3 and focuses on controlling the center with other pieces.
* The Dragon Variation (1...c5 d4 Nf6 g3 dxc4): One of the sharpest and most aggressive lines in chess, with both sides creating attacking chances.

Why do grandmasters love the Sicilian?

1. **Counter-attacking potential**: By delaying their own pawn moves, Black can often respond effectively to White's plans.
2. **Flexibility**: Many different pawn structures arise from this defense, offering varied transpositions.
3. **Initiative and complexity**: The Sicilian Defense frequently generates dynamic imbalances, leading to tactical opportunities.

However, be warned: the Sicilian Defense requires experience and knowledge, as it can backfire against an unprepared opponent!
