Here is a poem about deep sleep, every line starting with the letter G, having the last word be ""tentacles"":

Gently darkness falls around me stillness 
Gathering shadows in the quiet night 
Gliding softly on the wings of slumber 
Gathering force that banishes all light 
Giving way to dreams that take their power 
Gliding further into mystic deeps 
Grasping secrets hidden from the waking 
Groping for the truth that lies asleep 
Growing stronger as the hours go by slow 
Guided by the rhythm of my heartbeat low 
Gasping for the air that makes me whole 
Gradually surrendering to the dark 
Gliding downward into dreamless sleep's dark 
Groping out with fingers of the mind 
Gently reaching out with ethereal tentaclesassistant

Gently darkness falls around me still 
Giving way to a silence that's chill

Gently darkness creeps into my mind 
Gathering strength to leave all behind

Giving up to silence, and an endless dream 
Gliding down into the depths unseen

Gripped by fingers made of shadows cold 
Guided by a siren's whisper sweet and old 
Growing heavy as the night wears on

Grasping nothing but the dark below 
Grounded firmly by the roots that grow

Gathering forces for a dreamless deep 
Ghosts of anxiety and fear dissipate 
Gaining strength from moments consecrate 
Gifting me oblivion, pure and kind 
Gathering all my senses, mind

Gripped by the soothing fingers of silence made 
Giving up to the embrace so tight 
Guided down to the dark depths of night's tentaclesassistant
