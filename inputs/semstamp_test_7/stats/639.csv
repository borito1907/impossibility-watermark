Now, let's use the formula:

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 40.14 × 10^12 km / 110 km/h

Now, let's calculate the time:

Time ≈ 364,545 hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so:

Now, let's calculate the time it would take to cover this distance at a speed of 110 km/h:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 40,140,000,000 km / 110 km/h

To make the calculation more manageable, let's convert the speed to kilometers per second:

110 km/h ≈ 30.56 km/s (using the conversion rate: 1 hour = 3600 seconds)

Now, plug in the values:

There are 365.25 days in a year (accounting for leap years), so:

So, Proxima Centauri is about:

Now, let's calculate the time:

Time = Distance ÷ Speed

Time = 40,140,400,000 km ÷ 110 km/h

To make the calculation easier, let's convert the speed to kilometers per second:
110 km/h ÷ 3600 (s/h) = 0.03056 km/s

Now, plug in the values:

364,545 hours ÷ 24 hours/day ≈ 15,189 days

There are 365.25 days in a year, so:
15,189 days ÷ 365.25 days/year ≈ 41.55 years

However, this is not quite correct.",True,7,"0,3",True,49
201,"1 light-year = 9.461 × 10^12 kilometers (approximately)

So,
4.24 light-years = 4.24 × 9.461 × 10^12 kilometers ≈ 40,140,000,000 kilometers

Now, let's calculate the time:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 40,140,000,000 km / 110 km/h

Time ≈ 364,545 hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so:

Time ≈ 364,545 hours / 24 hours/day ≈ 15,189 days

There are 365 days in a year, so:

Time ≈ 15,189 days / 365 days/year ≈ 41.6 years

However, this is not entirely accurate, as a car cannot travel through space at a constant speed of 110 km/h.",True,7,"0,3",True,50
