532,"So either way, we've found a new prime number not on the original list, which contradicts our initial assumption that the list p1, p2,..., pn is complete.

",True,1,"6,2",True,25
533,"So, we have found another prime number that was not on our original list.

",True,1,"6,2",True,26
534,"Hence, this would mean there exists another prime number not included in our original list.

",True,1,"6,2",True,27
535,"Hence, the list of prime numbers p1, p2,..., pn is incomplete, leading to a contradiction.

538,"Thus, we've found a new prime number that was not on our initial list, contradicting our assumption that the list was complete.

",True,1,"6,2",True,31
539,"This implies that there exists at least one more prime number that was not included on the original list.

",True,1,"6,2",True,32
540,"Thus, we have reached a contradiction, which implies that our initial assumption - there are finitely many prime numbers - must be false.

",True,1,"6,2",True,35
543,"Hence, we've reached a contradiction because this new prime factor should also be included in our list of primes.

",True,5,"6,2",True,36
544,"So we have reached a contradiction, which means our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers is wrong.
