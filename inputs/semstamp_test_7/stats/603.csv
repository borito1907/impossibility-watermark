71," According to San Diego Zoo, Averages, (adult male):

* Length: 11-13 ft (3.3-4 meters)
* Height: 5-6 ft (1.5-1.8 meters) at the shoulder

For simplicity, let's use a volume calculation based on a rectangular prism with dimensions roughly approximating the rhino's body:

* Length: 12 ft (3.66 meters)
* Width: 4 ft (1.22 meters)
* Height: 5 ft (1.52 meters)

Now, let's calculate the internal volume of the rhino in cubic feet:

Width: 1 meter (3.3 feet)
Height: 1.5 meters (4.9 feet)

This gives us a volume of approximately:

Volume = Length × Width × Height = 4 m × 1 m × 1.5 m = 6 cubic meters (212 cubic feet)

78," Let's use the volume of a sphere (V = (4/3) \* π \* r^3) to calculate the volume of a single ping pong ball:

Radius (r) ≈ 20 mm (0.79 inches)
Volume of a ping pong ball ≈ 2.48 cubic centimeters (cm³) or 2.48 milliliters (mL)

Now, let's divide the total volume of the rhino (in liters) by the volume of a single ping pong ball (in milliliters):

Number of ping pong balls ≈ Total Volume (liters) ÷ Volume of a ping pong ball (milliliters)
≈ 6000 liters ÷ 2.48 mL 
≈ 2417,321 ping pong balls

So, approximately 2,417,321 ping pong balls could fit inside a taxidermied rhino!",True,6,"6,0",True,1
