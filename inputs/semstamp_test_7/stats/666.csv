Let's break it down step by step:

Given equation: sinh(x) + cosh(y) = x + y

Take the derivative of both sides with respect to x (treating y as a constant):

(d/dx)(sinh(x)) + (d/dx)(cosh(y)) = (d/dx)(x) + (d/dx)(y)

Using the above mentioned derivatives, on the left side:

cosh(x) + 0 = 1 + 0

Now take the derivative of both sides with respect to y (treating x as a constant):

(d/dy)(sinh(x)) + (d/dy)(cosh(y)) = (d/dy)(x) + (d/dy)(y)

Again using the derivatives:

0 + sinh(y) = 0 + 1 

Simplifying:

sinh(y) = 1

So we have two equations:

To solve these, recall that:

cosh(u) = (e^u + e^{-u})/2 
sinh(u) = (e^u - e^{-u})/2

(e^x + e^{-x})/2 = 1

Take the derivative with respect to `x`, considering `y` as a constant:

So, to summarize, we have two equations:

Solving these equations, we get:

* `x = arcosh(1) = 0` (since `arcosh` is the inverse hyperbolic cosine)
