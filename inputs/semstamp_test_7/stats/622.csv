19,"**Step 1: Simplify the integral**

Rewrite the integral as:

$$I = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} x^{-s} \frac{\zeta(-s-m)\zeta(-s)}{-s} ds$$

**Step 2: Express the Zeta functions in terms of Gamma functions**

$$I = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} x^{-s} \frac{\zeta(-s-m) \zeta(-s)}{-s} ds$$

$$I = -\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} x^{-s} \zeta(s+m) \zeta(s) ds$$

**Step 2: Use the functional equation for the Zeta function**

$$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} x^{-s} \frac{\zeta(s+m)\zeta(s)}{-s} ds$$
