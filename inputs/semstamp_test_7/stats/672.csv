(2.8 × 3) = 8.4 (first values)
(-4.4 × -1) = 4.4 (second values)
(59 × 75) = 4425 (third values)
(240 × 60) = 14400 (fourth values)
(5.4 × 11.2) = 60.48 (fifth values)

Now, combine these multiplied values to form the final answer:
1024.48 ≈ 1024.5 (rounding off the excessive decimal places)

So, the correct answer for X is approximately **1024.5**.assistant
