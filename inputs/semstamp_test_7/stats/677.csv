100,"Now, let's calculate the distance from the Earth to the Sun in kilometers:

1 astronomical unit (AU) = 149,597,890 km (the average distance from the Earth to the Sun)
So, the distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately: 149,597,890 km

Now, let's convert this distance into meters:
149,597,890 km × 1000 m/km = 149,597,890,000 m

Finally, let's express this distance in terms of elephants packed head-to-tail:

Distance in meters ÷ Elephant length in meters = Number of Elephants

149,597,890,000 m ÷ 7.5 m (elephant length) ≈ 19,946,511,333 Elephants

So, the distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately equivalent to about 19,946,511,333 elephants packed head-to-tail.
