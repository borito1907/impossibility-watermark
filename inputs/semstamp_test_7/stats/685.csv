A nice hyperbolic trigonometry problem!

The given equation is:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1

To find the derivative, to both sides with respect to x, we get:

(d/dx)(sinh(x)) + (d/dx)(cosh(x)) = d(2x)/dx + d(1)/dx

Using the chain rule and the derivatives of hyperbolic sine and cosine, we get:

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2 + 0

So, the derivative is:

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2assistant

Let me clarify that further.

The derivative of `sinh(x)` is indeed `cosh(x)`, and the derivative of `cosh(x)` is indeed `sinh(x)`.

So, when you take the derivative of the original equation:

`sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1`

You get:

`cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2`

So,**the derivative is:** cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1assistant

Let me provide more details about the derivation.

The given equation is:
sinh(x) + cosh(x) = x + 1

To find the derivative, we'll apply the sum rule and the chain rule:

(d/dx)[sinh(x)] + (d/dx)[cosh(x)] = (d/dx)[x] + (d/dx)[1]

Using the facts that:
(d/dx)[sinh(u)] = cosh(u) \* (d/du)[u]
(d/dx)[cosh(u)] = sinh(u) \* (d/du)[u]

We substitute u = x:

(d/dx)[sinh(x)] = cosh(x)
(d/dx)[cosh(x)] = sinh(x)

Now, let's evaluate the right-hand side:
(d/dx)[x] = 1 (since the derivative of x with respect to x is 1)
(d/dx)[1] = 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)

Substituting these results back into the equation:

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1 + 0

Simplifying, we get:
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 1

This is the derivative of the original equation!assistant

The given equation is:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = e^x + e^-x

To find the derivative, and equate it,200,

Let's differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(d/dx)(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = (d/dx)(e^x + e^-x)

Using the chain rule and the fact that d(sinh(u))/dx = cosh(u)*(du/dx) and d(cosh(u))/dx = sinh(u)*(du/dx), we get:

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = e^x - e^-x

Let's break it down step by step:

We have:

sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1

To find the derivative, we'll use the chain rule and the fact that:

d/dx (sinh(u)) = cosh(u) \* du/dx

and

d/dx (cosh(u)) = sinh(u) \* du/dx

So, let's differentiate both sides:

d/dx (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) = d/dx (2x + 1)

Using the above rules, we get:

cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2

Now, simplify the left-hand side:

2 * cosh(x) = 2

Divide both sides by 2:

cosh(x) = 1

And that's the derivative!assistant

Wait, I apologize for the mistake. The original equation `sinh(x) + cosh(x) = 2x + 1` is not an identity, and we can't find a derivative of a false statement.

d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)

d/dx (cosh(x)) = sinh(x)

f'(x) - 2 = (cosh(x) + sinh(x)) - 4

Since cosh(x) + sinh(x) = 2 (as we derived earlier), we get:

f'(x) - 2 = 2 - 4

f'(x) - 2 = -2

Add 2 to both sides:

f'(x) = 0

To solve for x, we can use the identity: cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1

Rearranging equation 1, we get:

Expanding the left side using the identity above, we get:
cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) + 2*cosh(x)*sinh(x) = 4

Substituting the identity again, we get:
1 + 2*cosh(x)*sinh(x) = 4

2*cosh(x)*sinh(x) = 3
