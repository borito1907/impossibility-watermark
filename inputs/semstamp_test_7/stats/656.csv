35,"In reality, there isn't a definitive answer to this question, as swallows do not typically fly in a vacuum where airspeed velocity could be accurately measured.

",True,0,"6,0",True,4
36,"However, if we assume that an ""unladen"" swallow means one that's not carrying any additional weight (like nesting material or food), we could look at some general information about swallows' flight capabilities.

",True,4,"5,2",True,1
37,"However, (just for fun), if we consider the average cruising speed of a swallow, This typically ranges between 35-45 km/h (22-28 mph).",True,6,"5,2",True,2

Swallows are agile flyers,.",True,7,"5,2",True,3

41,"Keep in mind that this is just an educated guess, Swallows can fly at varying speeds depending on the circumstances, such as chasing prey or migrating.
