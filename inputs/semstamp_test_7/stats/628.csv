83,"To solve for x, we can try to isolate the exponential term and then take the logarithm of both sides:

2x² - 2ex⁴ = -15e + 3

x² - ex⁴ ≈ (-15e + 3) / 2

Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln|x² - ex⁴| ≈ ln((-15e + 3) / 2)

Using the properties of logarithms, we can expand the left-hand side:

ln|x|² - ln|e|x|⁴ ≈ ln(-15e + 3) - ln(2)

Since e is a constant approximately equal to 2.718, we can substitute it in:

ln|x|² - 4ln|x| ≈ ln(-30.825 + 3) - ln(2)

Combine like terms:

-3ln|x| ≈ ln(-27.825) - ln(2)

Now, divide by -3:

ln|x| ≈ [ln(-27.825) - ln(2)] / -3

Raise both sides to the power of e (approximately 2.718) to eliminate the logarithm:

|x| ≈ e^[ln(-27.825) - ln(2)] / -3

Simplify the exponent:

|x| ≈ e^[-1.430]

Take the square root of both sides to find x:

x ≈ ±√[e^(-1.430)]

x ≈ ±0.241 (approximate value)

Please note that the solution involves an approximation, as the original equation does not have a closed-form analytical solution.
