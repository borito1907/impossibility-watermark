- G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N\*m^2/kg^2)
- M is the mass of the black hole (4,000,000 M)
- c is the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)

149,"Assuming an average birch tree diameter of 20 meters (65.6 feet), we can convert it to AU as follows:
```
20 meters √ó (1 kilometer / 1000 meters) = 0.02 kilometers

0.02 kilometers √∑ (149.6 million kilometers / 1 AU) ‚âà 1.34 √ó 10^(-7) AU

So, the diameter of a birch tree is roughly 1.34 √ó 10^(-7) AU.
