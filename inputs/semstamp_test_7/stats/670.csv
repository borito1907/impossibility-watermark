We can use the Schwarzschild radius formula to estimate the event horizon radius of Sgr A*:

- r_s is the event horizon radius (Schwarzschild radius)
- G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N\*m^2/kg^2)
- M is the mass of the black hole (4,000,000 M)
- c is the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)

r_s ≈ 12,100 km

149,"Assuming an average birch tree diameter of 20 meters (65.6 feet), we can convert it to AU as follows:
```
20 meters × (1 kilometer / 1000 meters) = 0.02 kilometers

0.02 kilometers ÷ (149.6 million kilometers / 1 AU) ≈ 1.34 × 10^(-7) AU

So, the diameter of a birch tree is roughly 1.34 × 10^(-7) AU.
