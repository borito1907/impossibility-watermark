Section 174 of Title 1 of Public Health Service (PH) was amended by Tax Cut and Job Acts (P.L 115 -97). It disallows research or Experimental expenditures from 2023, which can be amortize over period of at least five years. The new rule applies to amounts incurred on January 01,2023 or subsequent year.The Act also eliminates alternative simplified research Credit election that existed previously.

The bill also repeals section of code allowing certain research expenditures be deducted as business expenses when incurred instead of being capitalized & amortized over future periods

It should be noted that these provisions do not affect existing Research & Development(R&D )Tax Credits available within US Federal Code.

These amendments were part of larger overhaul package aimed at encouraging investment in domestic production while simplifying existing laws related tax treatment for businesses operating across various industries. As result many organizations will likely experience changes their bottom line due revisions affecting R&D expenditures treatment moving forward<|eot_id|>",99.35897588729858,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,121.33838844299316

What an age-old and profound questions! As you requested, I'll provide one specific and actionable take: 

**""To cultivate meaningful moments of happiness and growth through intentional living, self-discovery, and positive impact, leaving each experience bettered by having existed within it.""

Let me unpack it:

* ""Intentional living"": It's not merely going along with daily routines but rather living a deliberate, thoughtful life aligned with values and passions, which brings satisfaction and joy;
* ""Self-discovery"": The pursuit of understanding ourselves â€“ strengths, weakness, desires, and limitations â€“ so we become better friends to others, and we can develop as human beings;
* ""Positive impact"": We strive for actions that add constructive change in some form, whether locally or globally. Each person contributes positively, however modestly;
* ""Leaving experiences bettered"" emphasizes the concept of continuous improvement and the creation of something valuable from interactions, be they social, environmental or otherwise.  

Keep in mind this is only one possible answer among many potential definitions, yet it gives a clear guidance for everyday choices and aspirations.

Would I help clarify anything else regarding the meaning of Life or assist you with anything else today? I have plenty of time and willingness to chat further, explore new subjects, or help organize any other thoughts or plans you might have at present<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,212.22888779640198

"" Broker"" has an fascinating origins.

"" Broker"" originated from two different paths, but they eventually converged.

One source of broker was from old French word, which means merchant or agent and derived from verb, that means: negotiate or deal.

However, another possible origin of the term 'broker' could be traced to middle english word brocour, meaning 'one who makes arrangements'. This word likely originated from french word 'brocour',  ultimately coming from verb 'brocourier', which meant 'negotiate' or 'deal'. Over time this term got changed into 'broker'.

Now, let's combine it with'stock'. The term'stock' originated in medieval Latin as'stockus' or'stocka' which were used for wooden posts or tree trunks. The modern sense of'stock' developed over centuries to refer to inventory, merchandise, or capital invested.

By combining these etimologies we arrive at'stock broker'. A'stock broker' essentially acts like an intermediary or an agent facilitating transactions involving'stock' or 'inventory' - typically investment products, commodities, etc.

So, there you have it! That's where'stock broker' originates from<|eot_id|>",97.90576100349426,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,170.37809824943542

I've taken not of it.

This appears be an extract from an Excel spreadsheet or similar dataset, containing information related Brand ratings from an ecommerce platform such as (presumably) an internal dataset from an internal source within)  - possibly an internal dataset from -Amazon.

The columns are: 

1.) ""Code"" which seems to refer to specific codes for each Brand.
2.) ""A"", ""C""- presumably this denotes Brand name or type 
3. ""5"", ""4""- this column contains numerical values that represent customer ratings given to each code.

Now, I can help assist and perform tasks based on these data, let me ask, How may I assist? Do you need help summarizing these ratings, calculating average ratings per Brand or Code, filtering out certain records, or something more? Please let me know so I can better assist! ðŸ˜Š<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,171.3471291065216
