1,1831532,"Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is ""excited"" for what Captain Marvel has in store. ""I'm really proud of what it is that we're making,"" she teased to E! News. ""I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it.""
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. ""That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!"" the actress explained in June. ""To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'""
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
""This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself,"" Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. ""But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness.""
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019."
2,11084412,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle."
3,11678838,"When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48."
4,8030924,"WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), closing out a floor debate over spending priorities and opening a new front on the midterm campaign trail.
As expected, no Democrats voted for the blueprint from Ryan. The former Republican vice presidential nominee's plan returns to ideas that have come to define the GOP, including ending federal deficits by cutting taxes on the rich, revamping Medicare and slashing almost every other aspect of government.
In a vote of 219-205, House Republicans showed an unusual display of cohesion, as they have for the last four years on Ryan's proposals, presenting voters with a unified snapshot of GOP priorities.
""This document is our vision for getting Americans back to work and our budget back in balance,"" said House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).
Democrats swiftly showed how they would use the vote as campaign fodder in the coming midterm elections to portray the GOP as out-of-step with most Americans.
""This House Republican budget is the worst I have ever seen,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the budget committee, to applause on the House floor. ""At every juncture in this House Republican budget, they choose to protect very powerful special interests and the most wealthy in the country at the expense of everybody else.""
Like President Obama's budget earlier this year, the GOP document is not expected to be adopted. Congress has already agreed to spending for this fiscal year and next under a previous agreement.
Ryan's proposal would overhaul Medicare for the next generation of seniors, boost defense spending beyond Obama's levels and slash most other domestic spending on college aid, food stamps and basic government investments. Tax rates for the wealthy would be cut to a top rate of 25%.
Twelve Republicans broke from the party to oppose the budget, many of them seeking deeper reductions than Ryan proposed. Even though Ryan's budget would repeal Obamacare, he relied on the taxes and savings in the healthcare law to reduce deficits.
Obama's budget, by contrast, would continue deficit spending for the next 10 years, raise taxes on the wealthiest 3% of households and fund priority programs, including expanded investments in education and infrastructure.
But in a sign of how difficult budget issues remain for lawmakers, a Democratic proposal that largely mirrored the president's approach was put to a vote Thursday and 31 Democrats opposed it."

Panicked investors who were prompted by fears and participated in the mammoth stock sell-off should get back into the market immediately, because a lengthy hiatus often results in missing out on gains.
Investors who lost their nerve this week should not wait to get return to the market since some individuals will wind up sitting on the sidelines for too long. Investing in the market straightaway prevents investors from taking part of “another form of market timing,” said Edison Byzyka, vice president of investments for Hefty Wealth Partners in Auburn, Ind.
An investing strategy based on emotions never succeeds since your feelings will “always betray you” and is a fool’s errand, said Matthew Tuttle, portfolio manager of the Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core ETF in Stamford, Conn.
If the stock market has a down day, followers of this strategy then believe the following day will also experience losses, he said. On the contrary, these investors also believe that if the market is in the green, the next day’s performance will produce the same positive results.
Dollar cost averaging remains the best method to accumulate wealth over the long haul and individuals should “invest early and often,” said Robert Johnson, president of The American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
Selling stocks sounds like a simple decision, but there are caveats, since investors also have to determine when to return to the market. What often happens is that many people only get one of those decisions right and get the other one wrong and end up losing money, he said.
Investors who adhere to the dollar cost averaging strategy can use their money over time to purchase equities at “lower prices if the market does decline for a long period of time,” said Yale Bock, a portfolio manager on Covestor, the online investing marketplace, and president of Y H & C Investments in Las Vegas.
Pursuing an alternative method relies on using all of your capital at one time and having to be accurate about trying to time both the price and market, “which is literally impossible,” he said.
The next step is determining what increments your dollar cost average strategy will follow, depending on your outlook and approach.
“I believe the next six months to a year will be a difficult period of time in energy, so allocating capital at the end of every month to buy the stocks of energy companies we want to own is our approach,"" Bock said.
Remaining an active investor yields greater returns since on the average, the market always rises. An index of large cap stocks rose 10% per year since 1926, and there have not been any negative 20-year holding periods recorded since then, Johnson said.
Of course, there have been ten-year holding periods that have produced negative returns, such as the years of 1999 through 2008 that included the dotcom bust and the financial crisis resulting in an an average annual return of –1.38%. But that decade was the first negative ten-year holding period since the Great Depression years of 1930 through 1939.
Long-term investors should not forget that the number of positive returns outweighs the down years. In the S&P 500, the benchmark index, there have been 68 positive return years and only 22 negative years since 1926.
Buying additional stocks during a dip in the market can net you more gains than merely sticking with dollar cost averaging since this tactic produces “mediocre performance,” said Sreeni Meka, a portfolio manager on Covestor and a managing member of Lakeland Wealth Management in Lakeland, Tenn.
“If you are an individual stock picker, what is the point of buying equities when fundamentals are off?” he said. “If great opportunities are ahead and the economy is coming out of recession, what is the point sticking to cash and investing only average amount?"""
6,11982534,"A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain.
Sheila Thorns from Birmingham underwent a Caesarean section early this morning during which six children - four boys and two girls - were delivered.
Mrs Thorns gave birth two months prematurely - on her 30th birthday.
All the babies were placed in incubators after being delivered but one - a girl - died shortly afterwards while being given a blood transfusion.
Twenty eight medical staff from Birmingham Maternity Hospital were present at the delivery and the five surviving babies - Ian, Roger, Lynne, Julie and Susan - are now being cared for by a specialist team.
Doctors say around one birth in 3,000 million will result in sextuplets.
However, those odds were reduced for Mrs Thorns due to the fertility treatment she had been undergoing.
Her husband, Barry, said the couple had been aware of the possibility of having more than one baby.
Mr Thorns said: ""We were expecting this multiple birth but we were stunned when we were first told that Sheila was likely to have five or six babies.""
""We have wanted children all our married life,"" he added.
Over the past two years Mrs Thorns has been treated with gonadotrophin which contains two hormones known as FSH and LH.
The consultant treating her, Dr Cooke, said Mrs Thorns and several other women were unable to conceive until the proportion of LH was increased but that had resulted in a series of multiple pregnancies.
""We have had one set of triplets recently, and we know of some more who have not yet been born. I think we are going to have some more yet,"" he said.
But Dr Cooke believed the medical profession had learnt a lot about the effects of fertility drugs from those cases: ""I think there is a real possibility that one day we shall be in a position to let a patient choose how many children she will have,"" he said.
Before 1938 multiple births were registered as separate events but it is believed around 18 sets of sextuplets have been born in the UK this century though it is unknown how many of them survived.
However, the anxiety is not yet over for the Thorns who have been warned by an obstetrician that more of the babies may yet die.
Three of the Thorns sextuplets survived.
The numbers of twins, triplets and other multiple births have soared in the years since fertility and IVF treatment became widely available.
The first case in Britain of a set of sextuplets surviving came with the births of Jenny, Ruth, Lucy, Kate, Hannah and Sarah Walton in 1983.
In November 1997 the world's first recorded case of surviving septuplets occurred when three boys and four girls were born to a couple in the United States.
In 1996 Mandy Allwood, a British woman on fertility treatment, gave birth to eight children - all died soon after delivery.
Since then births of octuplets have occurred in the US- when seven survived - and Italy - when six children survived."

9,8636104,"The connection between terrorism and the invasion of Iraq has increasingly blurred over the past few months.
The connection between terrorism and the invasion of Iraq has increasingly blurred over the past few months. While the Bush Administration has perceived the invasion of Iraq as part of the war on terrorism, critics of the administration have charged that the invasion has undermined that war. Notwithstanding the pretext under which the US had made the possession of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq the casus belli of the invasion, the administration has indeed made the right choice, but it has failed to clarify the connection between terrorism and the invasion of Iraq. At the center of this connection is the ideology justifying the terror acts committed by Bin Laden's organization, Al-Qaeda, against the United States. This ideology had been shaped by the political persecution and torture of Islamists in the notorious prisons of despotic Muslim regimes. Thus, destroying those prisons and opening up the political space in despotic countries is vital to the success of the US war on terrorism.
Bin Laden's ""World Islamic Front Statement, Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,"" which was issued in 1998, began with the Koranic verse that Islamic radicals call the Verse of the Sword: ""but when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, seize them, beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)."" In his statement, Bin Laden made the case for issuing a fatwa (religious edict) in which the ""ruling to kill the Americans and their allies-civilians and military-is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it…"" The basis for this fatwa, according to Bin Laden, had been the crimes committed by the United States against Muslims, the American occupation of Islam's holiest of places, devastation of Iraq and support of the Jewish state.
This fatwa, according to Bin laden, was in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah as revealed in the Koranic verses: ""fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,"" and ""fight them until there is no dissension and religion becomes God's.""
The 1998 fatwa was neither the first nor the last issued by Bin Laden. In 1996, he issued a fatwa entitled ""Declaration of War Against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places,"" in which he railed against the Saudi regime. He accused the regime of committing great transgressions that produced Kufr (un-belief) in the holiest of lands and referred to violence against the Kingdom and the United States as the ""volcanic eruption emerging as a result of the severe oppression, suffering, excessive iniquity, humiliation and poverty."" In October 2001, he issued a statement in which he said ""these events [September 11 attacks] have divided the whole world into two sides: the side of the believers and the side of infidels."" He also insisted that ""every Muslim has to rush to make his religion victorious.""
On the surface, these fatwas reveal that Bin Laden has shifted his focus from fighting the rulers of Saudi Arabia towards American soldiers and civilians, turning the US war on terrorism into a war between Islam and the West. A careful reading of the fatwas, however, reveals that they are consistent with the theological arguments drawn from the important, but almost never mentioned document, The Neglected Duty (Al-Faridah al-Gha'ibah), written by Muhammad Abd al-Salam Faraj and known as the creed of Egytian president Anwar Sadat's assassins. In fact, Bin Laden's fatwas and their implications for Muslims, whether in Islamic lands or the West - cannot be fully understood without comprehending the overall message and directives of The Neglected Duty.
This document articulated a set of ideas revolving around the establishment of an Islamic state (Caliphate). At the center of these ideas lay the modern concept of Takfir al-Hakim (Unbeliever ruler), whereby the ruler is accused of un-belief and thus of apostasy from Islam, a condition which justifies violence against him. Muslim readers have been impressed by the document, because it based its arguments mainly on the Koran, the Traditions relating to prophet Muhammad, and influential Muslim scholars. According to the document's logic, not only is the rule of God over the earth obligatory for Muslims, but also Jihad is also a duty. Jihad in this context means fighting the infidels, especially the enemies residing in the lands of Islam and/or governing through the illegal rule of Muslim leadership.
It is not a coincidence that Bin Laden's referral to the Koranic verses underpinning the arguments for his fatwa against the Jews and Crusaders had been emphasized by The Neglected Duty. The opening Koranic verse in the fatwa had been designated ""The Verse of the Sword"" by The Neglected Duty.
Importantly, the United States and Israel are not the only target of fundamentalists. Bin Laden and his ilk, basing their views on the logic of The Neglected Duty, implicitly perceive the Muslims who cooperate, work and live with infidels as legitimate targets. Had the fundamentalists known (or knew) about the presence of a significant number of Muslims in the New York towers, would they have changed their mind about striking the towers? The fundamentalists refer to Ibn Taymiyah's interpretations to validate their view. Ibn Taymiyah provided the theological basis for Muslims to fight the Mongols, though they had become Muslims, and many Muslims had been forced to join their armies. He, and other scholars, professed that the Mongols were not pious Muslims and that Muslims under their rule should die ""jihading"" for their faith or be martyred at the hands of Jihadis.
Only this logic explains the indifference with which fundamentalists regard Muslims residing in the West and/or collaborating with Westerners as those Iraqis partaking in the Coalition Provisional Authority's effort to build a democratic Iraq. The irony is that the U.S. invasion of Iraq, besides liberating Iraqis, has destroyed the prison walls within which the ideology of fundamentalists had been shaped and perpetuated. Yet, the United States is under constant attacks by critics in both the Muslim and Western worlds. Islamist terrorism has made non-Islamists the Mongols of this age. Westerners and Muslims alike need to understand the logic of this ideology. Only then will they be able to overcome it.
