I'll be glad explain it.

**What are vectors, matrices, and...tensortors?**
=============================================

To understand **tensortors**, let's first review **scalars**, **vector**, and **matrics**.

*  Scalar: a single number (e.g., `x`)
*  Vector: an ordered list of scalar numbers (e.g., `[a,b,c]` or `[1,2,3]`)
* Matrix: A table of values with rows and columns (e.g., `[ [1,2],[3,4],[5,6] ]`)

A tensor is a higher-dimensional extension of these concepts. While a matrix has only one set of rows and columns, a tensor can have more than two.

Think of a tensor like a cube or a cube of cubes (yes, you read that right!). Each element of the tensor can represent a value at a specific point in space or time.

Now, imagine you are trying to model a video sequence where each frame has a width, height, color channels (RGB). You could think of it as a tensor with 3-dimensions:

- Dimension 1: Time (frames)
- Dimension 1: Width
- Dimension 1: Height 
- Dimension 1: Color Channels

**Tensor Properties**

Tensors can be described based on its properties:

* Rank (number of Dimensions): e.g. a matrix has a Rank  of  1, while the video tensor we just imagined would have a rank of 3.
* Shape (the size of each Dimension): A tensor with a Rank of 3 might have a Shape of `(time_steps, width, height)`

**Transformation Based Models: How Tensor relates**

With that basic understanding of what tensors are, let us dive into transformation based models.

Transformation based language model typically refers to a class of deep learning model called Transformers. The Transformer model revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) when introduced in 2017 by a research team atGoogle led by researcher Bapanaish.

Transformer model relies heavily on Self-attention mechanism which allows it to weigh each wordâ€™s influence when generating text, making it better suited for sequential inputs (text).

Here are some key aspects where tensor plays a crucial role:

1.  Embeddings: When a text sequence (like a Sentence) is fed into a Transformer model, each word gets embedded as a tensor of fixed length (d-model). These vectors capture semantic information of each token (words or pieces of tokens).

2.  Attention Weights: The attention weights are calculated between every possible pairs of tokens, resulting in a tensor of attention values.

    * Query (q): The output from previous layer (in case of Decoder) or Embeddings (in case of Encodeer). It represents what you want to compute attention over.

    * Key (k) : The output from previous layers (in case of Decoder) or Embeddings (in case of Encoder). It represents what you want to compute attention over, same as query.

    * Values ( v ): Same as Keys, used as weighted sum once attention has been determined.

This computation results in a tensor of attention values, which are then applied to values to obtain context vectors.

The Transformer model relies extensively on tensor computations, leveraging parallelization to improve efficiency compared to traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

So there you have it, folks! That's a brief overview of what a tensor is, its properties, and its significance in transformation-based modeling.
