5,"In most mythologies and popular culture, as vampires and zombies are creatures from different realms of horror, there isn't a clear-cut answer to this scenario.",True,6,"6,0",True,4
6," However, on the one hand, we can consider the following possibilities:

**Scenario 1: Zombie becomes a vampire**
If a vampire bites a zombie, the vampire's venom might somehow reanimate the zombie's dead cells, allowing it to transform into a vampire-zombie hybrid.",True,7,"0,3",True,1

8," However, and for the sake of creative exploration, the possibilities can be entertaining to consider:

In some cases, if a vampire bites a zombie, on the surface, it might appear that the vampire has infected the zombie with vampirism.",True,3,"0,3",True,11
17," But what if the zombie's condition is not just a physical affliction but also a mystical one?

",True,5,"6,0",True,1
