Immediately, I flashed back to the good old days of wearing similar overalls while hanging out with friends at the local skate park. Those carefree summer days felt like a lifetime ago.

They appeared to be on a mission, I watched as they made a beeline for Buckle. One of them pulled out a list and began scrutinizing every single item on the sale rack.",5.196152422706632,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
