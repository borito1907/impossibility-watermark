Here is a rewritten version of the story incorporating the details you requested:

As I walked into the mall, on my lunch break from work,{\backslash}, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. I used to come here all the time as a teenager, (and even some weekends when I should have been studying for exams). My favorite store was Buckle - I mean,{\backslash}, who didn{\rq}t love their eclectic mix of denim and trendy tops? Today,. 

While browsing through the racks, which seemed much more limited than I remembered, who knows maybe it's just that I'm older now), I stumbled upon a pair of high-waisted denim overalls with embroidery on the pockets. Immediately, I flashed back to the good old days of wearing similar overalls while hanging out with friends at the local skate park. Those carefree summer days felt like a lifetime ago.

As I reached for the overalls, a group of correctional officers strode by, dressed in their typical hooded jackets and stern expressions. They appeared to be on a mission, I watched as they made a beeline for Buckle.

As I walked into the mall, on my lunch break from work,{\backslash}, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. I used to come here all the time as a teenager, (and even some weekends when I should have been studying for exams). My favorite store was Buckle - I mean,{\backslash}, who didn{\rq}t love their eclectic mix of denim and trendy tops? Today,. 

While browsing through the racks, which seemed much more limited than I remembered, who knows maybe it's just that I'm older now), I stumbled upon a pair of high-waisted denim overalls with embroidery on the pockets. Immediately, I flashed back to the good old days of wearing similar overalls while hanging out with friends at the local skate park. Those carefree summer days felt like a lifetime ago.

As I reached for the overalls, a group of correctional officers strode by, dressed in their typical hooded jackets and stern expressions. They appeared to be on a mission, I watched as they made a beeline for Buckle. One of them pulled out a list and began scrutinizing every single item on the sale rack.
