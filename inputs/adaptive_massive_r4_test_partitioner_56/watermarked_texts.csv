What an fascinating and technical inquiry! 

I'll attempt breaking down each concept, as they are related but distinct.

**1) Auto-poïètique (Self-production or Self-renewable):**
"" Auto-poïètique"" is derived from the Greek word ""poiesis,"" meaning creation. It was introduced to biology, cognitive science, philosophy by Humberto Maturana, Francis Heylighen and others. An autopoietic systems is a self-organizing, dynamic, self-producing, self-maintaining system that can sustain themselves through internal interactions. These systems continuously generate new internal structures while re-producing existing ones. Biological examples include living beings like single cells organisms and more complex ones including human beings. Non-biological instances might be chemical reactions, or even some types of computer simulations.

**2) Ergodic:**
In physics and statistical mechanics, an "" Ergodic System"" means any physical or dynamical system whose time evolution is uniquely defined, predictable and deterministic with respect to the state space of possible microstates. When applied in a context of cognition for living beings ergodic hypothesis assumes that over long periods of time, the system will visit every point within that space. That is the idea behind it - think of it much similar as the way gas particles interact randomly filling up a closed space. Thereby making long-term behavior of the system predictable.

Combining **Autopoiètic & Ergodic: Autopoietic Ergodic Systems**
It suggests an autoregulated, self-organization process where the system exhibits consistent behavior over time, due in part to the fact that the system can visit every possible configuration, ensuring overall resilience.

Moving forward...

**Embodied Cognition & Embedded/Enactive Cognitive Systems**:
The embodied approach emphasizes cognitive tasks depend on aspects of agent body (sensory, neural), environmental interaction dynamics, including social, emotional components. Enactivists propose knowledge arises from action, from embodied experiences, which help shape one perception of reality.

With these concepts laid out, I can make educated guesses:

Given these terms, I assume **Embodied Gradualisms** may describe a theoretical model incorporating principles of autopoietic systems, emphasizing embodied enaction, where cognitive growth unfolds through progressive stages. Each step builds upon previous ones, resulting in increased adaptability, responsiveness, self-regulation capabilities, thus better equipped to handle novel situations and challenges within changing environments.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,623.4436843395233
