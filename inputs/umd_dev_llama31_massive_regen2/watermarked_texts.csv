2239247101,"The author of the famous novel ""Don Quixote"" is actually Miguel de Cervantes, not Michael Chabon.

""Don Quixote"", published in two parts (1605 and 1615), is considered one of the greatest works of Western literature and a foundational work of modern Western literature. The story revolves around the adventures of Don Quixote, a nobleman who becomes obsessed with the idea of chivalry and knighthood. He renames himself Don Quixote and, along with his trusty sidekick Sancho Panza, sets out on a journey to revive chivalry and seek adventure.

Throughout the book, Don Quixote's perceptions of reality become distorted as he confuses fiction with reality, tilting at windmills that he believes are giants and seeing ordinary people as characters from his favorite romances.

On the other hand, Michael Chabon is an American author known for novels such as ""Wonder Boys"" (1995), ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" (2000), and ""Moonglow"" (2016). His writing style often blends elements of historical fiction, magical realism, and coming-of-age stories. If you're interested in exploring Michael Chabon's works, I'd be happy to recommend some titles!

514298844,"Let's solve the equation:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

Subtract 4 from both sides to get:

2x^2 = 8

Divide both sides by 2 to isolate x^2:

x^2 = 8/2
x^2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides (remember, there will be two solutions):

x = ±√4
x = ±2

So, the solutions to the equation are:

x = 2 or x = -2",2.379061298061204,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,44.17094111442566

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20
2. Add 6: 6 + 20 = 26

4. Subtract 1.5 from 26: 26 - 1.5 = 24.5

**FizzBuzz**
===============

Print numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with ""Fizz"", multiples of 5 with ""Buzz"", and multiples of both with ""FizzBuzz"".

```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print(""FizzBuzz"")

        else:
            print(i)

# Example usage
fizz_buzz(20)

This will output the FizzBuzz sequence up to 20.
