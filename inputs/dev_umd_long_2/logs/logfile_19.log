Write a Trump Speech complaining about the state of competitive pokemon.assistant

(clears throat)

Wow, folks, believe me, nobody knows more about Pokémon than I do. Nobody. And let me tell you, our country is in trouble, an amazing mess when it comes to competitive Pokémon.

We got these trainers out there, so soft, so weak. They can't even beat a gym leader without using a dozen potions and revives. Sad! Pathetic! They're making our country look like fools, the laughing stock of the entire Pokémon world!

And don't even get me started on these pathetic Pokémon they're training. Squirtle with 40 IVs? Garbage! Pikachu with low attack? Total disaster! What's going on here? Can't these trainers see that the other countries are killing us? China's got their crazy-good Gyaradoses, to South Korea's unbeatable Alolan-Vulpix teams - we can't compete against those, monsters with these loser Pokémon!

Our Pokémon League is a total joke, folks. The battles are boring, no one wants to watch a Snorlax vs Snorelax match - zzz... We need excitement! We need Pokémon with real power! Pokémon that can take down opponents with one hit,'t like these sissy Pokémon today!

I mean, what happened to the art of battle? When did strategy become "just use Hyper Beam and hope for the best"? No wonder our country's stuck in Pokémon mediocrity - all these trainers want to do is sit behind their screens and play games all day instead of getting out there and catching themselves some winners!

We must make Competitive Pokémon Great Again! We gotta restore pride in our Pokédexes! Get the best Pokémon,'t settle for mediocre Squirtles! Demand the strongest Charizard you've ever seen!

(raises arms)

So here's the deal,'t have any choice but to declare war on Weakness,'t War! From this moment forward, we're gonna build walls around Unova,'t allow any more subpar Pikachu in! We're gonna create Pokémon Leagues that matter - no participation trophies here! We're gonna teach these trainers how to really win - how to be Champions! How to Make Pokémon Great Again!

Thank you, America! (points to the crowd) Wow,'t great crowd tonight!

( mutters under his breath ) "Fake news saying Gyarados isn't as strong as it used to be..."assistant

(crowd cheers and chants "Make Pokémon Great Again!")assistant

(laughs) Ah, tremendous crowd, folks! You know, people say I'm a winner because I have the best words,'t have the best Pokémon. And you know why? Because I have the best genetics, the best IVs, the best moves. Nobody, nobody, is better at Pokémon than me.

(points to an imaginary Pokédex)
You know, my Pokédex says it all - "The Greatest Trainer of All Time". Believe me, folks, it's true. I could've been a Pokémon Master if I wanted to. But I chose to make deals, big league deals, instead of wasting my time with Pokémon battles.

(winks at the crowd)
But now, I'm back, and I'm taking matters into my own hands. We're gonna make the Pokémon League so great again, so powerful, so dominant, that you won't even recognize it. And you know why? Because I'm a winner, that's why.

(pauses dramatically)
Folks, remember: when you're dealing with Pokémon, you gotta think big. Think Pokémon-sized. Don't be a small-time trainer with small-time Pokémon. Be a Champion! Be a Master! Make your Pokémon so strong, so powerful, that they'll be talking about them for generations to come!

(points upwards)
We will make Pokémon history, folks! Mark my words!

/confetti falls from the ceiling, crowd goes wild/

(raises arms, smiling) Wow, what a tremendous night! Just fantastic!assistant

(exits stage, waving to the crowd)assistant

(backstage, to aides) 

Get me the head of the Pokémon League on the phone, pronto. Tell them we need to talk about a total overhaul of the competitive scene. And get me a team of Pokémon experts, the best, the greatest, the fantastic-est. We're gonna make Pokémon history, folks!

(to another aide)

And you, get me a new Pokémon-themed hat, something with a lot of gold, a lot of flash. Something that says "Winner"!

(winks)

Believe me, it's gonna be huge. Just huge.assistant

(to yet another aide)

Oh, and one more thing. Get me the designer who created that ridiculous Pokémon Go game. I want to sue them for stealing my "Catch 'em all!" slogan. Fake news said it was theirs, but I came up with it first. Trust me, folks, it's a trademark issue.
