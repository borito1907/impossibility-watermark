2. **Kobe Bryant's nickname**: "Mamba" was also the nickname of Kobe Bryant, the legendary American basketball player who played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA. He earned the nickname due to his fierce competitiveness and deadly accuracy on the court, which reminded people of the snake's lethal reputation.

3. **Mamba Sports Academy**: After Kobe Bryant's retirement, he founded the Mamba Sports Academy, a training facility focused on helping young athletes develop their skills in various sports. The academy aims to inspire and empower young players to reach their full potential.

4. **Energy drink**: Mamba is also an energy drink brand that's popular in some parts of the world. It's marketed as a refreshing beverage with natural ingredients and no artificial flavors or preservatives.
