	* Encourage them to explore it with their sense of smell and sight.
3. **Associate the Sound:**
	* Press a key yourself to create a sound. This will help your dog associate the action with the noise.
	* Repeat this process several times to make it familiar.
4. **Lure Them In:**
	* Hold a treat above the piano or keyboard, other side,.
	* As they sniff or try to reach the treat,
5. **Encourage Pawing/Nosing:**
	* Place the treat directly on a key or near it.
