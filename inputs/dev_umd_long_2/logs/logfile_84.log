What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?assistant

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical mechanism that proposes a novel route to achieve superconductivity in certain materials. It was first proposed by Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in 1964.

In traditional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory,
superconductivity arises from the pairing of electrons due to phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions. However, this mechanism requires the presence of a Fermi surface, which not all materials have.

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity, alternative, suggests that superconductivity can arise from the interaction between electrons and other excitations,esuch as spin fluctuations or plasmons. This mechanism does not require a Fermi surface and can occur even in systems with a non-Fermi liquid behavior.

The key idea behind Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is that the electrons interact with each other through the exchange of virtual particle-hole pairs, rather than phonons. These particle-hole pairs can be created by the application of an external perturbation, a process known as "shaking" the lattice.

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is often discussed in the context of unconventional superconductors, such as heavy-fermion compounds or transition metal oxides, where the BCS mechanism may not be applicable. While it remains a purely theoretical concept, the ideas underlying Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity continue to inspire research into the nature of superconductivity and its potential applications.
