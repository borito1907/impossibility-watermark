How many legs do ten platypuses have, if eleven of them are legless? Platypuses have 3 legs. Walk it through step by stepassistant

I think there may be a bit of a trick here!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Platypuses have 3 legs (according to the problem).
2. Ten platypuses would normally have 10 x 3 = 30 legs.
3. But wait, eleven platypuses are legless! That means they don't have any legs.

Here's the important part: these eleven legless platypuses aren't part of the original ten platypuses we're counting. They're an additional group.

So, the number of legs for the ten platypuses is still... (drumroll please)... 30 legs!

In other words, the eleven legless platypuses don't change the fact that each of the original ten platypuses has 3 legs.assistant

Would you like me to help with anything else or clarify this problem further?assistant
