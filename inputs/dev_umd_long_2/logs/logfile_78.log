Here is a non-rhyming poem about darkness:

Darkness
A veil of mystery, profound
Falling softly like a silent mist
It wraps around me, (us)
Enshrouding all in its quiet grasp

In this solemn stillness I find myself lost
Adrift in an endless expanse 
Without boundaries or definition
Free to wander without a anchor 

The darkness holds within it secrets untold
Whispers of the unknown echoing through time 
I am but a small part of its grand tapestry
Weaved into the fabric of existence itself 

As I surrender to its depths I discover 
A strange sense of freedom and peace 
For in the darkness lies the promise 
Of a new dawn yet to come.assistant
