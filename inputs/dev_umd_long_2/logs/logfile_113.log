Do you know about Holy Magic Century?assistant

Holy Magic Century is an upcoming mobile game developed by Com2uS, the same company behind the popular game Summoners War: Sky Arena! 

From what I've gathered, Holy Magic Century seems to be a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in a fantasy world where magic and technology coexist. The game's storyline revolves around an ancient prophecy that foretells the coming of a great calamity, and players must embark on a journey to unite the warring factions and save the world.

Some features that caught my attention include:

1. **Immersive Open World**: Explore a vast open world with diverse environments, from mystical forests to sprawling cities.
2. **Action-Packed Combat**: Engage in dynamic battles with a variety of magical abilities and combat styles.
3. **Character Customization**: Create unique characters with deep customization options, as well as complex skill trees for further development.
4. **Guilds and Social Features**: Join forces with friends and form guilds to take on challenging content together, or engage in social activities like PvP tournaments and events.
