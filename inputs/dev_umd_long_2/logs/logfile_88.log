What is the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 x 10–2 M KOH solution?assistant

A chemistry question!

To find the H+ ion concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base. In aqueous solutions, strong bases like KOH fully dissociate into their constituent ions.

In this case, KOH dissociates into K+ and OH-:

KOH → K+ + OH-

The hydroxide ion (OH-) reacts with water to form hydroxide ions and hydronium ions (H3O+, which is often represented as H+):

OH- + H2O → H3O+ (or simply H+) + OH-

Since KOH is a strong base, the reaction goes to completion, so the concentration of OH- will be equal to the concentration of KOH, which is given as 4.8 × 10^(-2) M.

Now, we can use the equilibrium expression for water dissociation (Kw = [H+] [OH-]) to find the H+ concentration:

Kw = 1.0 × 10^(-14) = [H+] [OH-]

Rearrange to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1.0 × 10^(-14) / (4.8 × 10^(-2))
≈ 2.08 × 10^(-13) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in the 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-13) M.assistant
