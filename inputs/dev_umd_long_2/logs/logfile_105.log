Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

We see the bustling streets of New York City, before zooming in on a rooftop where SPIDER-MAN (Peter Parker) is perched, a look of determination on his face.

SPIDER-MAN:
(to himself)
I've been tracking this mysterious energy signal for hours. It's gotta be connected to the recent robberies.

Suddenly, to our surprise, SUPERMAN (Kal-El/Clark Kent) descends from the sky, hovering above the rooftop.

SUPERMAN:
Spider-Man! I've been looking for you.

SPIDER-MAN:
(startled)
Superman! What brings you to NYC?

SUPERMAN:
(smirking)
Just passing through. Heard rumors of a web-slinging vigilante causing quite the stir. Thought it'd be...enlightening to meet you.

SPIDER-MAN:
(skeptical)
Uh-huh. Well, I'm not exactly a danger to the public, Supes. Just trying to keep my city safe.

SUPERMAN:
(leaning forward)
Ah,'that what they all say? You may mean well, and your methods are...unorthodox,'to say the least...

But,'that's exactly why I have to take you in.

SPIDER-MAN:
(bristling at the tone)
Oh? And who says you get to decide that?

The two engage in a fierce battle, with Spider-Man's agility and quick thinking pitted against Superman's incredible strength and heat vision.

CUT TO:

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

The fight spills out into the streets, with civilians running for cover as the two superheroes clash.

SPIDER-MAN:
(webbing up buildings)
You might be strong,'t Supes 'but I know these streets!

SUPERMAN:
(laughing)
Strength isn't everything,'Spider-Man'You're no match for me in a fair fight.

SPIDER-MAN:
( landing a series of quick jabs )
Fair fight?! You're the one starting trouble here!

The battle rages on until:

CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

As the fight reaches its climax,'the two finally come to a standstill'surrounded by destroyed park benches and upturned trash cans.

SUPERMAN:
(exhaling heavily)
Impressive, Spider-Man...'Perhaps more impressive than I expected...

SPIDER-MAN:
(panting)
(What do you want,'Supes'? You didn't come all the way here just to roughhouse...)

SUPERMAN:
(serious tone)
There's something in Metropolis, a threat beyond human comprehension. I could use someone like you.

SPIDER-MAN:
(intrigued)
Someone like me...Go on.

SUPERMAN:
(smirking)
Let's put our differences aside for now,and work together.

Spider-Man hesitates for a moment before nodding in agreement.

FADE OUT.

This script sets up an interesting dynamic between the web-slinger and the Man of Steel, a battle that ultimately leads to a tentative truce and potential partnership. Of course, feel free to modify it to fit your vision!assistant

Would you also like me to elaborate on the backstory or motivations behind Superman's interest in teaming up with Spider-Man,assistant

Or perhaps we could delve deeper into the contrasting philosophies and values of these two iconic heroes' How their differing approaches to justice and morality might lead to some fascinating conflicts and debates...assistant

This team-up could also explore the theme of accountability in superheroism' How do these powerful individuals answer to the public and themselves when it comes to their actions and decisions?assistant
