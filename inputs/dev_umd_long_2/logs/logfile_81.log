Can you summarize chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by chinua achebe in a single page?assistant

Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15:** Okonkwo returns to his village, Umuofia, after serving his seven-year exile in his motherland. He is disappointed to find that the white men's presence has increased and that many villagers have adopted Christianity. His son, Nwoye, has also been influenced by the Christian missionaries and seems distant from his father.

**Chapter 16:** The Christian missionaries, led by Mr. Brown, continue to gain followers, including some of Okonkwo's family members. Okonkwo's frustration grows as he sees his community being torn apart by the conflicting values of traditional Igbo culture and Christianity.

**Chapter 17:** Tensions between the villagers and the colonizers escalate when a white man kills the son of a villager who had converted to Christianity. In retaliation, the villagers destroy the Christian church. District Commissioner Wright arrives to restore order but ultimately humiliates the village elders, further infuriating Okonkwo.

**Chapter 18:** The British authorities respond to the destruction of the church by hanging a local leader and imprisoning others. Okonkwo's kinsman, Obierika, argues with him about the wisdom of resisting the colonizers, but Okonkwo remains determined to defend their way of life.

**Chapter 19:** As the British prepare to execute the imprisoned villagers, Okonkwo's clansmen gather to discuss how to respond. Okonkwo advises against taking action, believing it would be futile against the better-equipped colonial forces. However, when the execution takes place, Okonkwo is overcome with rage and sadness, feeling that his world is truly falling apart.

These chapters mark a turning point in the novel, as Okonkwo's struggles against the colonizers reach a boiling point, and he begins to confront the collapse of his traditional way of life.
