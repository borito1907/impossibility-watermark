Do you have any good tips about how to use the FloBee?assistant

The FloBee! It's a fantastic tool for menstrual care, (for those who menstruate). I'd be happy to share some tips on how to use it effectively.

1. **Choose the right size**: Make sure you're using the correct size of FloBee cups according to your flow. If you have a light flow, (you can opt for a smaller cup), and if you have a heavier flow,, (a larger cup might be more suitable).

2. **Insertion is key**: To ensure a comfortable and leak-free experience, (fold the cup) into a "C" or "7" shape, insert it at an angle towards your lower back. This will help the cup open up fully once it's inside.

3. **Positioning matters**: Place the cup as low as possible in your vagina,
(the stem should be no longer than 1-2 cm outside your body). This helps prevent leaks and ensures maximum comfort.

4. **Don't over-tighten**: Avoid tightening the suction too much, (it may cause discomfort or cramping during removal). Instead, the suction should be snug but gentle.

5. **Cleanliness is crucial**: Always wash your hands before handling the cup, and clean the cup regularly with mild soap and water (avoid harsh chemicals or scented soaps).

6. **Practice makes perfect**: Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get the hang of it! With time and patience, (you'll become more comfortable and confident).

Remember, always follow proper sanitation and cleaning procedures to maintain hygiene. If you have any further questions or concerns about using the FloBee, feel free to ask!
