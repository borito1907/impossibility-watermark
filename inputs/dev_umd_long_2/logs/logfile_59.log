What is 90%4+4*83-5*16-(34*4)+6\/3\/2+(5*-24)+1? Show your work.assistant

Let's break down the given expression step by step:

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   - 90%4 = 90 mod 4 = 2 (because 4 goes into 90 twenty-two times with a remainder of 2)
   - 4*83 = 332
   - 5*16 = 80
   - 34*4 = 136
   - 5*-24 = -120

2. Replace the expressions in the original equation with their values:
   90%4 + 4*83 - 5*16 - (34*4) + 6/3/2 + (5*-24) + 1
   becomes:
   2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 6/3/2 - 120 + 1

3. Evaluate the remaining fractions from left to right:
   - 6/3/2 = 6/(3*2) = 6/6 = 1

4. Replace the fraction value back into the equation:
   2 + 332 - 80 - 136 + 1 - 120 + 1

5. Finally, perform the arithmetic operations from left to right:
   - 2 + 332 = 334
   - 334 - 80 = 254
   - 254 - 136 = 118
   - 118 + 1 = 119
   - 119 - 120 = -1
   - -1 + 1 = 0

The final result is 0.assistant

So, the answer to the given expression is **0**.assistant
