Solve the equation
sin^7(x) + 1\/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1\/cos^3(x)assistant

What a fascinating equation!

To tackle this, we can start by using some trigonometric identities.

Let's rewrite the equation as:

$$\frac{1}{\sin^3(x)} + \sin^7(x) = \frac{1}{\cos^3(x)} + \cos^7(x)$$

Now, recall that $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$. We can use this identity to simplify the equation.

Multiplying both sides of the original equation by $\sin^3(x) \cos^3(x)$ (to get rid of the fractions), we get:

$$\cos^3(x) + \sin^10(x) = \sin^3(x) + \cos^10(x)$$

Next, let's apply the Pythagorean identity:

$$\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$$

Raising both sides to the power of 5 (a clever trick!), we get:

$$\sin^{10}(x) + 10\sin^8(x)\cos^2(x) + 35\sin^6(x)\cos^4(x) + 50\sin^4(x)\cos^6(x) + 25\sin^2(x)\cos^8(x) + \cos^{10}(x) = 1$$

Now, swap the sine and cosine terms on the left-hand side:

$$\cos^{10}(x) + 10\cos^8(x)\sin^2(x) + 35\cos^6(x)\sin^4(x) + 50\cos^4(x)\sin^6(x) + 25\cos^2(x)\sin^8(x) + \sin^{10}(x) = 1$$

Comparing this with our earlier equation, we can see that:

$$\cos^3(x) + \sin^10(x) = \sin^3(x) + \cos^10(x) = 1$$

So, the equation is an identity! It's true for all values of $x$.

Isn't that wonderful? The equation simplifies down to a fundamental property of sine and cosine.assistant
