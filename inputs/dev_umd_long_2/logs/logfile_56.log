hello world program in pascalassistant

A classic!

Here is the traditional "Hello, World!" program in Pascal:
```
program HelloWorld;

begin
  writeln('Hello, World!');
end.
```
Let me explain what's going on:

* `program HelloWorld;` declares a new program called `HelloWorld`.
* `begin` and `end.` define the boundaries of the program's code block.
* `writeln('Hello, World!');` uses the built-in `writeln` function to print the string `'Hello, World!'` followed by a newline character.

To compile and run this program, you'll need a Pascal compiler such as Turbo Pascal or Free Pascal. Once compiled, running the program will output the famous message to the console.

Have fun with your Pascal programming adventure!assistant
