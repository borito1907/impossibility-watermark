What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?assistant

The Alfa Romeo 164 is a luxury car produced by the Italian automaker Alfa Romeo from 1987 to 1998. One of the most unique features of the Alfa Romeo 164 is that it was the first Alfa Romeo model to be built on a front-wheel drive (FWD) platform.

Prior to the 164, Alfa Romeo's cars were mostly rear-wheel drive (RWD), so this marked a significant shift in design philosophy for the brand. The FWD layout provided better traction and stability, making the 164 more appealing to a wider range of buyers.

Additionally, the 164 was also notable for being part of the "Type Four" project, a collaborative effort between Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Lancia, and Saab to develop a shared platform for their respective models. This resulted in the 164 sharing its underpinnings with the Fiat Croma, Lancia Thema, and Saab 9000.

The Alfa Romeo 164 also gained recognition for its sleek, wedge-shaped styling, penned by Pininfarina, which helped to distinguish it from other luxury sedans of the era.

Overall, the Alfa Romeo 164's innovative FWD platform, combined with its stylish design and collaborative development process, make it a standout model in Alfa Romeo's history.assistant
