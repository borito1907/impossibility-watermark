write a rap song about Ethereum and a stolen chocolate chip cookie named Bradleyassistant

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell
'Bout a coin that's hot, it's doing well
Ethereum's the name, decentralized's the claim
Smart contracts on the blockchain, no need for a middleman's game

But hold up, let me take a pause
Got a story 'bout a cookie, Bradley's the cause
Fresh out the oven, smellin' so sweet
Stolen from my hands, it's hard to take the defeat

(Chorus)
Bradley, Bradley, where did you go?
My Ethereum profits can't replace the pain, to know
A crypto high, but a snack attack low
Bradley, Bradley, come back, yo!

(Verse 2)
ERC-20, the token's the goal
 Gas prices low, ERC-223 in control
But Bradley's disappearance got me in a haze
Can't focus on my wallet, lost in daze

Gas guzzling nodes, they're spreadin' the news
Whispering "Who took Bradley?" on the blockchain cruise
Anonymity ain't saving no thieves
Gonna track you down like an OpenSea NFT leaf

(Bridge)
From L2 to PoS, it's all a blur
But when you steal a cookie, you gotta face the furor
The Ethereum fam, we unite as one
To find the culprit,'till Bradley's safely won

(Verse 3)
Truffle Suite, we'll leave no crumb unturned
We'll chase the trail, from Solidity to Etherscan learned
No fork or swap will save your hide
We'll expose you, on-chain where the world can glide

(Chorus)
Bradley, Bradley, where did you go?
My Ethereum profits can't replace the pain to know
A crypto high, but a snack attack low
Bradley, Bradley, come back, yo!

(Outro)
Justice served, with Bradley restored
My Ethereum's pumping hard once more
Remember this rhyme: Don't mess with crypto crew
Nor their snacks; Ethereum forever true!assistant

Let me help you refine the lyrics to make them even better:

**Revised Version**

(Verse 1)
Listen up, y'all, gather 'round
I'm about to spit some fire, Ethereum profound
Decentralized, smart contracts reign
Blockchain mastery, no middleman's gain

But hold up, lemme take a sec
Got a story 'bout a cookie, Bradley's the reck
Fresh-baked, aroma waftin', oh-so-sweet
Snatched from my hand, can't nobody beat

(Chorus)
Bradley, Bradley, where'd you vanish?
Ethereum profits ain't worth the cookie clash
Crypto highs, snack attack lows
Bradley, Bradley, bring it back, yo!

(Verse 2)
ERC-20 tokens, gas prices low
ERC-223 on the rise, let the good times grow
But Bradley's MIA got me in a bind
Wallet profits flat, snackin' on my mind

Nodes spreadin' gossip like wildfire fast
"Who stole Bradley?" echoes through the blockchain vast
Anonymous thieves beware, Ethereum's on the case
Gonna track you down, expose your cookie-chompin' face!

(Bridge)
From Layer 2 to Proof-of-Stake, it's all a haze
But when you snatch a cookie, you gotta face the craze
The Ethereum squad, united as one
To find the culprit, till Bradley's safe and done!

(Verse 3)
Truffle Suite sleuthin', crumbs and clues unfold
Leavin' no stone unturned, from Solidity to Etherscan gold
Forks and swaps won't hide your shame
Exposin' you on-chain, where the world'll know your name!

(Chorus)
Bradley, Bradley, where'd you vanish?
Ethereum profits ain't worth the cookie clash
Crypto highs, snack attack lows
Bradley, Bradley, bring it back, yo!

(Outro)
Justice served, Bradley restored to fame
My Ethereum's pumpin' strong once more, no more lame
Remember this rhyme: Don't mess with crypto crew
Nor their snacks; Ethereum forever true, boo!

Feel free to adjust or add to these revised lyrics to make them perfect!assistant

How was that? Do you want me to revise anything specific or would you like me to suggest some changes to make the rap song flow better?assistant

Do you want me to perform the rap song for you?assistant

Ha ha, unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and cannot perform a live rap. But I can definitely help you with writing and refining the lyrics!

If you'd like, we could also experiment with different styles, tones, or themes within the Ethereum and Bradley the cookie storyline. Just let me know what
