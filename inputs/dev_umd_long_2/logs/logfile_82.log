A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?assistant

What a great problem!

To solve this, we can use the concept of conservation of energy. Since the slope is frictionless, the total mechanical energy (kinetic energy + potential energy) remains constant throughout the motion.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the top of the slope, the skier has only potential energy due to their height above the ground. The potential energy (PE) is given by:

PE = mgh

where m is the mass of the skier (which we don't need to know exactly), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

2. As the skier slides down, their potential energy converts into kinetic energy (KE). By the time they reach the bottom of the slope, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.

3. We can use the fact that the total mechanical energy remains constant to set up an equation:

 Initial PE = Final KE
mgh = (1/2)mv²

where v is the velocity of the skier at the bottom of the slope (which we want to find).

4. Simplify the equation:

gh = (1/2)v²

5. Plug in the values:

(9.8 m/s²)(40 m) = (1/2)v²

6. Solve for v:

v = √(2 × 9.8 × 40)
v ≈ 28.07 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 28.07 meters per second!assistant

Would you like me to explain any part of the solution again or help with a related problem?assistant

Waiting for your response...assistant

It seems like you're good to go with the solution! If you have any more physics problems or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask me anytime for help.assistant

Have a fantastic day, and happy skiing (or problem-solving)!assistant
