**Title:** The Impact of Federal Reserve Monetary policy On WTi (Western Texas intermediate) pricing: An empirical investigation

**Abstract:**
This research examines empirically, using time series and regression analyses, 20,200 weekly returns from March 1999 to August of this year to investigate whether monetary policies set by the United States Federal Reserve System affect crude oil's Western Texas Intermediate price.

**Introduction**
The relationship between monetary policy and economic activities has gained considerable attention recently. Specifically, there is growing concern that expansionary monetary policy may be linked with rising crude prices due to inflation expectations and increasing consumption.

Crude oil is essential for industrial economies as it affects both supply chains and consumer behavior. Changes in crude price can impact real income and influence overall economic growth and stability. 

**Literature Review**

Empirical research has found mixed evidence linking US Federal Reserve actions with movements in crude markets; while many argue loose money causes higher futures, other claim that these effects are minimal or nonexistent.

A study conducted by Frank & Garcia (2009), which analyzed daily returns spanning January of '87 through June of '07, showed that FOMC surprises led to crude market reactions consistent with expectations based on monetary stance - i.e., rate reductions were seen as bearish whereas rate increases saw bulling price movements.

In contrast, another researcher (Hogan & Melick (2001)) found that FOMC statements were insignificant when predicting crude returns and attributed these results largely due limited power from small datasets employed throughout most literature available at time.

**Methodology**

Our research utilizes Vector auto-regression models (VARs) and Grange causality tests applied upon weekly return data spanning nearly two-and-a-half decades; we seek understand better how Fed funds rates relate toward crude market developments within U.S. borders. To control endogeneity issues present inherent when modeling non-stationary series such an approach ensures robust coefficients free potential omitted variables' impacts.


To estimate model's system equation below was formulated:


Y(t)= Œ≤X(t-1)Œµ(t)


where Y(t) is weekly return of crude at t period; X denotes prior week fed funds rate; Œ≤ stands parameter describing relationship among these two series while last term captures unforecastable errors occurring randomly each week


Assuming constant mean reversion rate per annum within sample span then follows:


Œ≤=[œÅ/(1-œÅ)]*E[r(t+1)]


Here œÅ is first-lagged correlation value derived off weekly fed funds rate time trend; second part accounts forward-looking aspect contained via expectations operator applied against upcoming week's anticipated rate adjustment


Granger Causal testing was conducted post-estimation so see what drives either series given alternative scenarios presented within table below:


Scenario | Fed Funds Rate | Oil Price | Conclusion


1 | ‚Üë | ‚Üì | Reject H_1: Fed affects Oil Price


1 | ‚Üì | ‚Üë | Reject H_0: Fed does not affect Oil Price


3 | ‚Üë | ‚Üë | Fail to reject H_1


**Results**



Our results indicate that there exists bidirectional causality running opposite directions depending which series lags whom - i.e one finds fed fund rate influencing crude market when utilizing current period values but once accounting lag effect becomes apparent then story flips completely revealing crude being driver instead!

These discoveries suggest policymakers should monitor crude market movements as potential harbinger signaling looming inflation risks down road despite maintaining accommodative stance now; similarly investors looking maximize profit could consider diversifying portfolios against possible downturns resulting rising borrowing costs later


Limitation section concludes discussion mentioning possibility certain external events outside sample period possibly affecting accuracy conclusions drawn here; nonetheless implications remain same - namely maintaining vigilant oversight key moving forward

What an fascinating and nuanced philosophical concept! Molinism, which originated from Spanish Catholic priest and Scholastic, Francisco Su√°rez de Molinar (1538 ‚Äì 1615) but was later popularly promoted by Dominican priest and Scholastic, Luis de la Cruz, OP, more commonly known as Luis de la Cruz or Luis of Cuenca; then later developed further by the Spanish Catholic priest Luis of Leon, OP, however it was most famously developed in modern philosophy by the philosopher Alfred Freddoso's mentor, Thomas Flint, with his book 'Divine providence: The molinist Account' that has been a major influence. It seeks to reconcile human free will with divine sovereignty through the idea of ""scientia-media"" or middle knowledge, which suggests God has knowledge not merely of necessary truths, but also of counterfactuals - statements that are true, about possible worlds.

Here's a proposed outline for a literature overview:

**I Introduction**
   * Provide a clear, concise background of the problem of divine foreknowledge, free-will.
   * Offer a basic overview of the core elements involved including divine omnipotence, human freedom and the nature of time, space, etc.
   * Clearly define the central research questions guiding your literature review: e.g., Can a coherent form of Christian theology be formulated that balances these seemingly competing concepts?

**II Defining Key Concepts: Omnisciences, Omnipotency and Human Freedom**
   * Discuss various understandings and definitions of divine omnipotence, its relationship to human agency and whether it can include the power to know the free choices of beings without predetermining their decisions 
   * Analyze the relationship between human freedom and divine omnisciences, highlighting the debates over whether human freedom necessitates limitations upon the scope of divine knowledge 
   * Examine the role of time (e.g., B-theory versus the presentism) and its implications on the discussion of free will, particularly regarding whether human decisions could ever be said truly free given a deterministic universe, etc.

**III The Evolution of the Doctrine: An Intellectual Historiography**
   * Delve into the history of thought behind the emergence and evolution of the molinist argument, beginning with the scholastics up to contemporary proponents 
   * Outline key figures, their works, influences, debates, criticisms
   * Discuss the relationship with other related doctrines, e.g., Augustinism, Semi-Palagianism, etc., highlighting areas of overlap, disagreement

**IV Criticisms & Challenges: Logical, Theological & Metaphysical Concerns**
   * Address common objections raised against Molinism, including logical inconsistencies, challenges to the coherence of middle knowledge, issues of randomness/chance 
   * Discuss the implications of these criticisms, including whether any proposed modifications could strengthen or undermine the overall argument 
   * Consider alternative proposals attempting to reconcile free will with sovereignty, e.g., Open Theism, Simple foreknowledge view 

**V Modern Interpretations & Current Trends: An Examination of the Present-Day Discussion**
   * Investigate recent philosophical engagements, debates, applications, especially among contemporary Christian thinkers, highlighting new avenues of exploration 
   * Discuss ongoing tensions, open questions in the field - e.g., compatibility with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics; the problem of evil 
   * Consider interdisciplinary dialogues, e.g., intersections with science, social sciences, literature, culture studies

**VI Conclusion**
   * Synthesize the primary themes, debates and challenges identified throughout the literature review 
   * Offer some assessment on the viability of molinism as an attempted synthesis of human freedom and divine sovereignty 
   * End the review with reflection on the relevance, implications and avenues forward of this complex, longstanding philosophical conundrum, possibly highlighting areas requiring future investigation, dialogue.

This outline aims at offering a structure that covers the breadth of the subject while still being focused enough to allow you to engage deeply with specific issues relevant to the study.
