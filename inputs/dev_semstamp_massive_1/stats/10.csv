Imagine you have a big box of different colored rubber bands.",False,,,,1

DON'T WORRY, I'M HERE TO HELP!

",True,6,"7,2",True,2
3,"

Let's try this.

",True,1,"7,2",True,3
4,"

Let's break it down step by step.

",True,3,"7,2",True,4
5,"

Don't worry about being ""dumb"" – I'm here to help explain things in a super simple way!

",True,2,"7,2",True,5
6,"Okay, imagine you have a big ol' ball of spaghetti.",False,,,,1
7,"So, you know how we can see lots of different things around us, like apples and chairs and cars?",False,,,,2
8,"Okay, so... you know how things can be big or small, right?",True,7,"5,2",True,3
9,"Okay, so you know how we can see big things like cars and trees and houses, right?",True,5,"5,2",True,4
10," And if we look really closely at those big things, we can see smaller things that make them up, like wheels on the car or leaves on the tree.

",False,,,,1
11," And if we look really closely at those things, we can see that they're made up of smaller things like wheels, leaves, and bricks.

",True,0,"1,4",True,2
12," But if we use special tools like microscopes, we can also see tiny things that are too small to see with our eyes, like atoms.

",True,1,"1,4",True,3
13,"Well, some really smart people (called physicists) think that those tiny things are made up of even smaller things called ""strings"".",True,6,"6,2",True,1
14," They're kinda like the strings on your favorite t-shirt, but WAY smaller.

",True,6,"0,3",True,1
15," Yeah, it sounds weird, but just go with me here...

",True,7,"0,3",True,2
16," Yeah, it's kinda weird! 

",True,1,"0,3",True,3
17," These strings are like... well, imagine a super-thin rubber band that's too small to see.

",False,,,,4
18," Yeah, like the kind you use to tie your shoes!

",True,0,"0,3",True,5
19,"Imagine these strings are like tiny, tiny rubber bands that vibrate at different frequencies.",True,6,"5,2",True,1
20,"These strings are way, way too small to see, but they vibrate at different frequencies, kinda like the strings on a guitar.",True,3,"5,2",True,2
21,These strings are thought to be the building blocks of EVERYTHING in the universe!,True,4,"5,2",True,3
22,"Imagine these strings are too small to see, but they're like the LEGO blocks of everything around us.",False,,,,4
23,"These strings are too tiny to see, but they're like teeny-tiny vibrations that make up everything around us.",False,,,,5
24,"These strings are too small to see, but they're thought to be the building blocks of everything around us.",True,5,"5,2",True,6
25," They're like the LEGO bricks of the universe!

",True,4,"1,4",True,1
26,"Imagine you have a bunch of rubber bands, and each one represents a string.",True,7,"7,2",True,1
27," If you pluck a rubber band, it vibrates at a certain frequency, making a sound.",True,6,"6,3",True,1
28," Physicists think that these cosmic strings vibrate at different frequencies too, which creates all sorts of particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons.

",True,2,"0,3",True,1
29," That's kinda like what these strings do, but instead of making sounds, their vibrations create different types of particles, like electrons or photons.

",False,,,,2
30, That's kinda like what these strings do.,False,,,,3
31, That's kinda like what these strings do.,False,,,,4
32," That's kinda like what these strings do in the universe – they vibrate at different frequencies, creating all sorts of particles and forces that make up the world we see.

",True,7,"0,3",True,5
33," That's kinda like what these strings do – they vibrate at different frequencies, creating all sorts of particles, like electrons and protons, which make up the stuff we see around us.

",False,,,,6
34, That's kinda like what these strings do in space-time.,False,,,,7
35," That's kinda like what these strings do, except instead of making sounds, they create all the different types of particles that make up everything in the universe, like electrons, protons, and neutrons.

",True,0,"0,3",True,8
36,The weird thing is that these strings exist in more than three dimensions.,True,7,"5,2",True,1
37,"The really cool thing about string theory is that it tries to explain how all these tiny things work together to make up everything we see in the world, from stars and planets to YOU!
