If you set n=0:
   0!/1!=1
   
This only holds true if 0!",True,1,"6,2",True,42

   When you plug in n=0, we would get:

   0!",True,1,"6,2",True,43
461," = 1/(n+1)
   
   As n approaches infinity on the right side, this equation turns into:

Then, for this pattern to hold true for 0!

   ... you'll notice that:

Substituting n=0 into this equation would require 0!=1 for the pattern to hold.
