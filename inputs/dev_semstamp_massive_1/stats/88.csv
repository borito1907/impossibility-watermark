In order to determine the H+ ion concentration, we need to consider that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base and completely dissociates into K+ ions and OH- ions.

",True,6,"6,3",True,1
2,"KOH → K+ + OH-

The concentration of OH- ions is equal to the initial concentration of KOH, which is:

[OH-] = 4.8 x 10^-2 M

Since water also autoionizes into H+ and OH- ions:

H2O ⇌ H+ + OH-

At 25°C, Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1 x 10^(-14)

Therefore,

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= (1 x 10^(-14)) / (4.8 x 10^(-2))
= 2.08 x 10^(-13) M

So, the H+ ion concentration is approximately 2.08 x 10^(-13) M.

Keep in mind that this calculation assumes ideal behavior of the solution, which may not hold true at very high or low concentrations.",True,2,"0,3",True,1
3,The given solution has an initial concentration of 4.8 × 10−2 M of KOH.,False,,,,2
4,"The equation for this reaction is:
KOH → K+ + OH-

Since it's a strong base, the concentration of KOH will be equal to the concentration of OH-, which is given as 4.8 x 10–2 M.

We can use the Kw value (ion product constant for water), which is 1.0 x 10–14 at 25°C:

Kw = [H+] [OH-]

Rearranging the formula to solve for [H+], we get:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1.0 x 10–14 / 4.8 x 10–2

Using your calculator to perform the calculation...

[H+] = 2.08 x 10–13 M

This is an extremely low H+ concentration, indicating a very basic solution.

",True,3,"0,3",True,3
5,"Please note that this result represents the concentration of H+ ions in the solution and not the pH, which would require taking the negative logarithm of [H+] (-log [H+]).",True,0,"6,0",True,1
