**Capture and Display Webcam Feed**
```python codeblock 
import cv2

# Initialize the default camera (index 0)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Read frames from the camera and display them in a window titled ""Webcam""
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    if not ret:
        break
    
    cv2.imshow('Webcam', frame)
    
    # Exit on key press 'q'
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the capture object when done and close all OpenCV windows.
",True,2,"5,2",True,1

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
To run this code, make sure you have:

* Python installed on your system (preferably with pip package manager)
* OpenCV library installed (`pip install opencv-python` or `conda install -c conda-forge opencv`)
* A webcam connected to your system and recognized as the default camera (index 0).
