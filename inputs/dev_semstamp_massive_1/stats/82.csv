142,"We can write:

PE_top = mgh = KE_bottom

KE_bottom = (1/2)mv², where v is the speed at the bottom

Equating these two expressions:

(1/2)mv² = mgh

Now, divide both sides by m (since it cancels out):

(1/2)v² = gh

Multiply both sides by 2:

v² = 2gh

Take the square root of both sides:

v = √(2gh)

Plugging in the values: g ≈ 9.81 m/s² and h = 40 m:

v = √(2 × 9.81 × 40)
