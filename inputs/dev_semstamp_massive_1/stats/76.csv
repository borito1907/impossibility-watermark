In simpler terms, if you have an infinite sequence of coin tosses (fair or biased), and an event A that satisfies these two conditions, then:

P(A) = 0   (the event almost surely does not occur)
or 
P(A) = 1   (the event almost surely occurs)

Intuitively, this makes sense: if an event's outcome can be determined by looking at the entire sequence (tail-measurability) and its probability doesn't depend on the initial parts of the sequence (constant probability), then the event should either happen with certainty (probability 1) or not happen at all (probability 0).
