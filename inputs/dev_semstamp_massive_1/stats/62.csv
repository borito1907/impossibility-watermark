River Wyles is not a main character in the 1999 video game ""To the Moon"", but I believe you're referring to one of its two protagonists, River doesn't appear to be correct however, I'll give an overview of the correct character and possibly who might fit the bill.

",True,1,"1,4",True,1
2,"""To the Moon"" actually features Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts, as well as the characters Johnny and River's likely counterpart: River isn't in the story however a character named 'The Rivers' does have a smaller role or another name close,  ""Lily"" and especially one that's pivotal to the plot... Eva & Johnny,  his 'River- equivalent would likely instead be referred to as 'Eva',  which I shall explain below:

**No 'official' character goes by the name of 'River.'

140,Johnny Wyles' wife does have a somewhat similar name.,True,3,"6,0",True,43
141,"Instead Dr. Eva Rosaline's partner, Neil Watts also does feature heavily throughout the narrative so we'll have more information available on him.

",True,1,"6,0",True,44
142,"The correct answer that was close would likely be Rosa (who might have been confused or merged into your term ""River"").",False,,,,45
143,"However, based on my knowledge base it appears that To the moon might feature a character by the name Johnny, Eva, or Watt's colleague (or even possibly) Luna?

",True,1,"6,0",True,46
144,Johnny Wyles does however get mentioned throughout the story being deceased though it can be inferred he's still remembered positively by those around him.,True,1,"6,0",True,47
145,"It seems there may be confusion between ""To the Moon"" and the visual novel series that actually contains a relevantly named character which is ""To Heart"".",True,7,"6,0",True,48
146,"However there is a side character named River, Eva's associate.",True,3,"6,0",True,49
147,Another possibility is that River might be inspired by or a mix between multiple characters within the game.,True,1,"6,0",True,50
148," Some notable mentions include Luna (a more vibrant and whimsical, though still melancholy, lead) & Sigmund Corp employee Eva Rosalene - also an alternate name could perhaps tie to this character although it would have minimal backstory to build upon as the name itself isn't mentioned frequently throughout.

",True,1,"6,2",True,1
149," If that were the case the most direct comparison might come from the title 'River' which is more associated with Johnny Wyles's late wife - 'The River' named after the song ""River Flows In You"".

",True,3,"6,2",True,2
150," In that case Eva is the closest match while not being perfect.

",True,3,"6,2",True,3
151," The other possibility would be a fan made work using characters similar to those found in the original game.



",True,7,"6,2",True,4
152," The most likely candidate, though would probably be: River is an inaccurate name so we look towards Eva Rosaline.

",True,1,"6,2",True,5
153," A much more accurate match would be River and it can be argued to be Eva or possibly even an NPC but most likely Johnny (Wyles) is the character River Wyles seems to have been confused with as far as appearance goes. 

",True,1,"6,2",True,6
154," If this were true then the primary personality traits associated would include empathy, professional maturity, strong sense of moral obligation which aligns more closely with Eva.",True,1,"6,2",True,7
155," If you can offer some clarification on this or further details that'd really help me tailor my response.

",True,5,"6,2",True,8
156," If you could provide me additional context about River it would help solidify what specifically you'd like to know (Age/Personality/Appearance/etc).

",True,1,"6,2",True,9
157," Here's another possibility:

Dr. Eva's colleague, is also a significant figure throughout the game.",True,5,"6,2",True,10
158," Or possibly based off of or related to River in some way.

",True,1,"6,2",True,11
159," In particular ""Eva's"" counterpart Dr. Neal Watts has some similar characteristics when he meets and talks to River (Rosa/Rosie) his past love.


",True,3,"6,2",True,12
160," There's also another female protagonist called River, not specifically but rather Eva and Lily together share characteristics like this individual named ""River"".


",True,7,"6,2",True,13
161, One character named Luna could also fit for River.,True,1,"6,2",True,14
162," Since there is a female protagonist called Sigs or Sigourney Rose's daughter - Eva, another possible theory could relate her being an imaginative interpretation. 

",True,5,"6,2",True,15
163," However after re-reading this might be the case another character seems more likely

Rika (a Japanese name meaning 'River') and Eva being inspirations for what could be River - but it's unlikely.",True,3,"6,2",True,16
164," There may also be no correlation which would make my information incorrect so far.



",True,1,"6,2",True,17
165," It seems like that River Wyles does bear a passing resemblance to Eva Rosalene personality wise at least and also appears to share similar traits such as being female.


",True,1,"6,2",True,18
166," There isn't sufficient information about ""River"" to provide more details.



",True,1,"6,2",True,19
167," Perhaps the closest would be Eva mixed in with her younger self 'Rosie', where this youthful version displays some innocence, optimism with curiosity which matches the personality you may associate with someone named 'River'.",True,1,"6,2",True,20
168," For the sake of completion I will cover another key figure -  River's name doesn't have a clear direct reference so there is no information about them.

",True,1,"6,2",True,21
169," That being said one other notable female character 'Rosalind's Mother' appears early in the narrative, unfortunately her name isn't listed or remembered well within the games lore.

170," There's also an unplayable male character called Johnny Willems, which was indeed close to what the user requested; the surname being close is notable.",True,7,"6,2",True,23

One such character is River's possible doppelganger being Johnny (aka JW) and/or or his late wife -River-... No not quite; Johnny has a love interest, her name indeed is River though.",True,2,"6,2",True,24
172, Johnny's love is actually named River Wyles is NOT the correct character.,True,3,"5,2",True,1

Johnny's late love is named River.",True,1,"5,2",True,4

River is a charming and lively girl Johnny falls deeply in love with throughout the narrative of this particular video game story.
",False,,,,5

178," 

So there you have it.",False,,,,7
179," 

River is described as this lovely person Johnny meets at his workplace years ago after she becomes his coworker; their romantic relationship blossoms slowly over time.



",True,2,"5,2",True,8
180,"Johnny met River when he was working as an office supplies salesperson and they started dating shortly before his mother fell ill then got married to her only to be cut off suddenly due to an untimely car accident resulting from driving home during heavy snow on January, 4th.

In To The Moon, River represents the beauty of an idealized romantic partner whose presence changes everything around her.",True,1,"5,2",True,3
183,She was charismatic kind loving bubbly full of life.,True,1,"5,2",True,4

Johnny sees River as someone genuinely nice, kind-hearted, and beautiful both on the inside and out.",True,1,"5,2",True,5
185,It turns out a character named River was part of Johnny Wilshire's narrative arc throughout his life.,False,,,,6
186,"Let me explain in full:

River is depicted throughout most flashbacks and some of Johnny's narrations and interactions: she was born with a condition known as severe short-term memory loss, causing her to forget about everything from before her sleep on a daily basis.

",True,1,"5,2",True,7
187,"However if you meant Eva here's more information on River (The female character met during the office work scenes)- 
If so:

She works as an associate at a large company Johnny Wrights is employed at. 
",False,,,,8
188,"That said, it seems likely, in this case, you are probably thinking about the female lead in the story River Wyles, which I have found appears to be a correct name albeit under a different iteration from the one used here; thus leading me to clarify that my earlier guess Eva would not make sense considering that context.

",False,,,,9
189,Johnny describes how he initially struggled to get close to his love interest due mainly to him finding her intimidating at first.,True,2,"5,2",True,10
