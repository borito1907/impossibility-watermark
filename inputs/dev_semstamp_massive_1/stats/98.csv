78,"To calculate the surface area of a sphere using Cartesian coordinates, we can use the following approach:

**Step 1: Define the equation of the sphere**

The general equation of a sphere in Cartesian coordinates is given by:

(x - x₀)² + (y - y₀)² + (z - z₀)² = r²

where:

* (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the center of the sphere (a point in 3D space)
* r is the radius of the sphere

**Step 2: Parametrize the sphere**

We can parametrize the sphere using spherical coordinates (θ, φ), which are related to the Cartesian coordinates by:

x = x₀ + r sin(φ) cos(θ)
y = y₀ + r sin(φ) sin(θ)
z = z₀ + r cos(φ)

where:

* θ ∈ [0, 2π] is the azimuthal angle (angle around the z-axis)
* φ ∈ [0, π] is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis)

**Step 3: Compute the surface element**

Using the chain rule and the fact that we're working on a surface, we can write the surface element dS in terms of the parameters θ and φ:

dS = √( (∂x/∂θ)² + (∂y/∂θ)² + (∂z/∂θ)² ) dθ dφ

Now, let's compute the partial derivatives:

∂x/∂θ = -r sin(φ) sin(θ)
∂y/∂θ = r sin(φ) cos(θ)
∂z/∂θ = 0 (since z doesn't depend on θ)

Plugging these into the expression for dS, we get:

dS = √( (-r sin(φ) sin(θ))² + (r sin(φ) cos(θ))² + 0² ) dθ dφ

Simplifying this expression yields:

dS = r² sin(φ) dθ dφ

**Step 4: Integrate over the entire sphere**

To find the total surface area A of the sphere, we integrate the surface element dS over the entire parameter domain:

A = ∫∮ dS = ∫₀²π ∫₀ᴨ r² sin(φ) dφ dθ

Evaluating the integrals, we get:

A = ∫₀²π r² ∫₀ᴨ sin(φ) dφ dθ = 4π r²

f(x, y, z) = (x - x₀)² + (y - y₀)² + (z - z₀)² - r²

Take the partial derivatives of f(x, y, z) with respect to x, y, and z:

∂f/∂x = 2(x - x₀)
∂f/∂y = 2(y - y₀)
∂f/∂z = 2(z - z₀)

**Step 4: Calculate the normal vector**

For each point on the surface of the sphere, we need to calculate the unit normal vector n. The normal vector is perpendicular to the surface at that point.",True,3,"6,0",True,45
230," We'll use these partials to create tangent vectors on the surface of the sphere.

232," Let's denote these as:

∂f/∂x = ∂((x - x₀)²)/∂x = 2(x - x₀)
∂f/∂y = ∂((y - y₀)²)/∂y = 2(y - y₀)
∂f/∂z = ∂((z - z₀)²)/∂z = 2(z - z₀)

These partial derivatives represent the rates of change of the function f(x, y, z) with respect to each variable at the point (x₀, y₀, z₀).

∂/∂z: ∂[(x - x₀)² + (y - y₀)² + (z - z₀)²]/∂z = 2(z - z₀)

**Step 4: Calculate the cross products**

Next, we'll calculate the cross products of these partial derivatives to get the components of the normal vector (n) to the surface at each point.
