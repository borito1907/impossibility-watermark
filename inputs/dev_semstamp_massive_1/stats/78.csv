Here's a short, non-rhyming poem:

Surrounded by the echoes of his name.

Here is a non-rhyming poem about ""JD"":

JD, a name that sparks intrigue and curiosity 
A combination of letters that hold a thousand stories untold 
It's the initials of someone who has made their mark 
A person with a unique perspective, shaping their own path 

In a world where everyone wants to be known 
JD stands out for being enigmatic, mysterious, and alone 
Their name is a whisper in the wind, a hint at something more 
An invitation to get to know them beyond the surface 

But like an artist with a canvas, JD paints their life 
With bold strokes of color and texture, ever-evolving, yet true to themselves 
They weave a tapestry rich and complex 
Each thread representing a piece of their soul 

Who is JD?",True,7,"1,4",True,2
