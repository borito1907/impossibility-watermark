To solve the equation, I'll start by subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x^2 + 4 - 4 = 12 - 4

This simplifies to:

2x^2 = 8

Next, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

(2x^2) / 2 = 8/2

x^2 = 4

Finally, I'll take the square root of both sides of the equation:

x = ¬±‚àö4

x = ¬±2

Therefore, there are two possible solutions: x = 2 and x = -2.

Let's solve the quadratic equation:

2x^2 + 4 = 12

First, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x term:

2x^2 = 12 - 4

This simplifies to:

2x^2 = 8

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to further simplify:

x^2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides to get the solutions for x:

x = ¬±‚àö4

x = ¬±2

So, there are two solutions to this equation: x = 2 and x = -2.",True,7,"7,2",True,3
