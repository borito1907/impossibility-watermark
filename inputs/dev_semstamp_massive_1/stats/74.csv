It looks like we have some equations to solve!

I'd be happy to help you solve for the variables.

3,"Given:

1) a + b + c = a... (equation 1)
2) b * a = 1... (equation 2)
3) b = 3... (given value)

From equation 2 and the given value of b, we can find the value of a:
b * a = 1 => 3 * a = 1 => a = 1/3

Now, substitute the values of a and b into equation 1:
(1/3) + 3 + c = (1/3)

Combine like terms:
c = -(1/3) - 3 + (1/3) 
   = -3

So, the solution is: a = 1/3, b = 3, and c = -3. 

",True,2,"6,3",True,1
4,"From the equation b * a = 1, we can start by finding the value of 'a' since we already know that b = 3.

b * a = 1 
3 * a = 1 

To find the value of 'a', divide both sides by 3:

a = 1/3

Now we have values for 'a' and 'b':

a = 1/3 
b = 3

Next, substitute these values into the first equation: 

a + b + c = a 
(1/3) + 3 + c = (1/3)

Combine like terms on the left side:

c + (4/3) = (1/3)

Subtract 4/3 from both sides to isolate 'c':

c = -1 

So, our solutions are:

a = 1/3 
b = 3 
c = -1",False,,,,2
5,"Given the equations:

1) a + b + c = a... (Equation 1)
2) b × a = 1... (Equation 2)
3) b = 3... (Equation 3)

From Equation 3, we already know that b is equal to 3.",True,3,"6,3",True,3
6," Now, let's substitute this value of b into Equations 1 and 2.

",True,7,"6,0",True,1
7," We can substitute this value into Equation 2:

3 × a = 1

To find the value of 'a', we can divide both sides by 3:

a = 1/3

Now, let's go back to Equation 1 and substitute the values we have found so far:

a + b + c = a

Substitute a = 1/3 and b = 3:

(1/3) + 3 + c = (1/3)

Combine like terms:

3 + c = -2/3 + 3

c = -2/3 + 3 - 3

c = -2/3

So, the solution is:
a = 1/3, b = 3, and c = -2/3.
