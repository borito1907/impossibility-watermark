The correct answer is: A) True

In object-oriented design, if you see a subclass with a name like ""BlinkingSpinningPentagon"" (or any other combination of multiple distinct characteristics), it often indicates that the class hierarchy has become overly complex and is misusing inheritance.

The correct answer is:

A) True

This is because the name ""BlinkingSpinningPentagon"" suggests that it's a subclass of Pentagon, but with additional characteristics (blinking and spinning).",True,7,"7,2",True,25
26," This implies that the subclass is adding new behavior rather than modifying or specializing the existing behavior of the parent class.

",True,4,"6,3",True,1
27," This is likely an example of overusing inheritance to add new features or behaviors, rather than creating separate classes or using other design patterns.

",True,5,"6,3",True,2
28," This implies that the subclass is adding new behaviors or properties to the original Pentagon class, rather than overriding existing ones.

",False,,,,3

",True,5,"6,3",True,4
30," However, using inheritance solely to add new behavior or properties can lead to tight coupling and fragility in your class hierarchy.

",False,,,,5
31," However, these characteristics seem to be orthogonal to the pentagon-ness of the class, implying that they could potentially be added to other shapes as well.

",False,,,,6

",False,,,,7
