Now, we can split the numerator into two separate fractions:

10,"Let's start by analyzing the given equation:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

First, we can rewrite the equation using the fact that sin^(-a)(x) = 1/sin(a)(x):

(sin^7(x)) * (sin^3(x)) + 1 = (cos^7(x)) * (cos^3(x)) + 1

This simplifies to:

sin^10(x) + 1 = cos^10(x) + 1

Now, let's subtract 1 from both sides:

sin^10(x) = cos^10(x)

Since the bases are the same (both are powers of 10), we know that:

sin^2(x) = cos^2(x)

Using the Pythagorean identity, we have:

sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

Rearranging, we get:

cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)

Substituting this into our previous equation, we get:

sin^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)

Combine like terms:

2*sin^2(x) = 1

Divide by 2:

sin^2(x) = 1/2

Taking the square root of both sides, we have:

±√(sin^2(x)) = ±√(1/2)
|sin(x)| = √(1/2) = 1/√2

Therefore, we have two possible solutions for x:

x ∈ {π/4, -π/4}

However, note that these values satisfy the original equation only when:

* sin(x) ≠ 0 (to avoid dividing by zero in the original equation)
* cos(x) ≠ 0 (for the same reason as above)

Considering the unit circle or testing with specific values, you'll find that:

x = π/4 is a valid solution.

We can start by factoring out the common term from both sides of the equation:

⇒ sin^7(x) × sin^3(x) / sin^3(x) + 1 = cos^7(x) × cos^3(x) / cos^3(x) + 1

Now, let's simplify using the identity: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

This allows us to express 1 in terms of sine and cosine:

1 = sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)

Substitute this expression for 1 into the original equation:

sin^7(x) × sin^3(x) / sin^3(x) + sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = cos^7(x) × cos^3(x) / cos^3(x) + sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)

Simplify further:

sin^10(x) / sin^3(x) + sin^2(x) = cos^10(x) / cos^3(x) + cos^2(x)

Since sin(x) and cos(x) cannot be zero (otherwise, their inverses would not exist), we can multiply both sides by sin^3(x)cos^3(x):

sin^13(x) + cos^2(x)sin^3(x) = cos^13(x) + sin^2(x)cos^3(x)

Combine like terms:

sin^13(x) - cos^13(x) + (sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(cos^3(x) - sin^3(x)) = 0

Using the Pythagorean identities again, we get:

(- cos(2x))^13/2 + cos(2x)(cos^6(x) - sin^6(x)) = 0

Substituting u = cos(2x):

sin⁵(2x)cos²(2x) + cos²(2x) = cos⁵(2x)sin²(2x) + sin²(2x)

Notice that the first term on each side is the same:

(sin²(2x)cos²(2x))(sin³(2x) - cos³(2x)) = sin²(2x) - cos²(2x)

Factoring out (sin²(2x)cos²(2x)):

(sin²(2x)cos²(2x))(sin³(2x) - cos³(2x)) = (sin²(2x) - cos²(2x))

If we divide both sides by (sin²(2x)cos²(2x)), which is never zero, we're left with:

sin³(2x) - cos³(2x) = (sin²(2x) - cos²(2x))/(sin²(2x)cos²(2x))

Now we apply a familiar trigonometric identity:

(sin²(2x) - cos²(2x))/(sin²(2x)cos²(2x)) = -cot(4x)csc(2x)

We arrive at:

sin³(2x) - cos³(2x) = -cot(4x)csc(2x)

At this point, you might recognize that there isn't an elementary solution for the general case of x, because our manipulation has produced a transcendental equation.

77,"Left-hand side (LHS):

= (sin⁴(x)) · sin³(x) + 1 / sin³(x)
= sin⁴(x) / sin³(x) + 1 / sin³(x)
= (sin⁴(x) + 1) / sin³(x)

Right-hand side (RHS):

= (cos⁴(x)) · cos³(x) + 1 / cos³(x)
= cos⁴(x) / cos³(x) + 1 / cos³(x)
= (cos⁴(x) + 1) / cos³(x)

Now we have:

(sin⁴(x) + 1) / sin³(x) = (cos⁴(x) + 1) / cos³(x)

To eliminate the fractions, multiply both sides by sin³(x)·cos³(x):

(cos³(x))(sin⁴(x) + 1) = (sin³(x))(cos⁴(x) + 1)

Expand and rearrange:

sin⁴(x)cos³(x) + cos³(x) = cos³(x)sin³(x) + sin³(x)

Subtract cos³(x) from both sides:

sin⁴(x)cos³(x) - sin³(x)cos³(x) = sin³(x) - sin⁴(x)cos³(x) + cos³(x)
sin³(x)(sin(x) - cos³(x)) = sin³(x) - sin(x)cos³(x) + cos³(x)

Factor out sin³(x):

sin³(x)[(sin(x) - cos³(x)) - 1] = - sin(x)cos³(x) + cos³(x)

Divide by -sin³(x), assuming it is not equal to zero:

-sin(x) + cos³(x)/sin²(x) = (-sin(x) + cos³(x))/(-sin³(x))

78,"Left-hand side (LHS):
We can factor out sin(x):

sin⁷(x) + sin⁻³(x) = sin(x)(sin⁶(x) + sin⁻²(x))

Using the identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1, we can write:

sin⁶(x) + sin⁻²(x) = (sin²(x))³ + (sin²(x))⁻¹

Right-hand side (RHS):
Similarly, we can factor out cos(x):

cos⁷(x) + cos⁻³(x) = cos(x)(cos⁶(x) + cos⁻²(x))

Again, using the same identity:

cos⁶(x) + cos⁻²(x) = (cos²(x))³ + (cos²(x))⁻¹

Now, our original equation becomes:

sin(x)(sin²(x))³ + (sin²(x))⁻¹ = cos(x)(cos²(x))³ + (cos²(x))⁻¹

sin⁷(x) + sin⁻³(x) = (sin(x))⁷ + 1 / (sin(x))³

Using the identity (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², we can multiply both numerator and denominator of the second term by (sin(x))³:

= (sin(x))⁷ + (sin(x))³ / (sin(x))³(sin(x))³

This simplifies to:

82,"Left-hand side:
We can use the identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 to express sin⁻³(x) in terms of sin(x):

sin⁻³(x) = (sin²(x))⁻(3/2)
= (1 - cos²(x))⁻(3/2)
= (cos²(x) - 1)^(3/2)

Substituting this back into the left-hand side:
sin⁷(x) + sin⁻³(x) = sin⁷(x) + (cos²(x) - 1)^(3/2)

Right-hand side:
Using a similar approach, we get:

cos⁻³(x) = (cos²(x))⁻(3/2)
= (sin²(x) + cos²(x))⁻(3/2)
= (sin²(x) + 1 - sin²(x))⁻(3/2)
= (1 - sin²(x))^(3/2)

So, substituting this back into the right-hand side:
cos⁷(x) + cos⁻³(x) = cos⁷(x) + (1 - sin²(x))^(3/2)

Equating both sides again:
sin⁷(x) + (cos²(x) - 1)^(3/2) = cos⁷(x) + (1 - sin²(x))^(3/2)

Noticing that both sides have the same expression inside the parentheses raised to the power of 3/2, we can set them equal to each other:

(cos²(x) - 1) = (1 - sin²(x))

Simplifying both sides:
cos²(x) = 1 - (1 - cos²(x))
= cos²(x)

This tells us that either cos(x) = ±1 or the original equation is an identity for all x.
