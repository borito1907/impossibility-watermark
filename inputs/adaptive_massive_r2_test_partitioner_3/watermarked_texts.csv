You're looking at using Negative prompt guidance, which can be an efficient and creative technique when generating images or manipulating existing ones using tools such as Diffusers (e.G: 2021's version of DeepDream Generator) or other AI generative art platforms that allow the input of textual description or ""prompts"" as instructions guiding how to transform the original content.

Negative promots are essentially ""what NOT to generate"". They help steer clear of unwanted output results, ensuring more control over desired outputs from these complex systems like stable diffusion model - which otherwise might yield unpredictable results without proper fine-tuning.

In essence, you're providing additional context so AI knows exactly what aspects need avoidance while still creating novel imagery based solely on remaining positive cues left unfiltered out by said 'negatively weighted keyphrases'.

Let me provide some insight:

- ""bad hands"": You're signaling that any resulting images or transformations involving human figures or characters, ideally, don't depict deformed, unnatural, or anatomically incorrect representations of human extremities.

- ""bad anatomy"": Expanding on previous point regarding accuracy when it comes specifically towards internal organ placement, musculature details & proportionate bodily dimensions across various subjects featured prominently.

Lastly,""mulated LimbS"", likely intended spelling being mutilated - implies avoidance also applies where damage disfigurement injuries etc have occurred upon any creature/person displayed within artwork output.

To give better results try rephrasing each term separately then combining afterwards i.e:
- bad_hand
- inaccurate_anatomy
- disfigured_humanoid_bodyparts

Note that certain platforms may interpret certain phrasing differently, feel free experimenting until achieving expected outcome(s)!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,375.23541712760925
