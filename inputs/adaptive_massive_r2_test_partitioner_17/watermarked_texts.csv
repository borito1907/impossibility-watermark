What an imagination spark! 

""On Red Planet's crimson ground,
No feathers flutter, no songs resound,
Or should I be proven astrally blind,
And bird-like creatures leave trails of design.

Perhaps, where Valleys twist and turn,
Winding canopies of rustling ferns learn
To shield the Martian wingbeats' thrums,
Echo-flapping as a hidden drums.

Amid Olympus' towering height,
In Valles Marineris' eerie night,
A flock of Martian birds may glide,
Their silhouettes against a crimson tide.

With eyes that shine as gemstones bright,
They navigate dust devils' swirling light,
Their wings a mesh of fibers fine,
Gathering solar winds' ethereal shrine.

Though Earthly birds we've never spied,
Migrating flocks may cross the red planet wide,
On windy dunes of Tharsis' slope so steep,
Martian songbirds trample secrets keep.

For now we dream of what could be,
When robots scan the alien sea,
Yet still we wonder: do birds reside,
Within the rusty realm of the red world inside?""
