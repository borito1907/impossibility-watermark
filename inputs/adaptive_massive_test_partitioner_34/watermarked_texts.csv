One of Einstein's greatest masterpieces! TheTheory of Relatility can be explained simply, and I'll use easy-peasey terms and real-life scenarios.

**What's it all bout?**
=====================

EINSTEIN's **Theory of Relativity** is a fundamental idea that changed the game of physics! It explains **space**, **time**, and **gravity** using TWO main concepts: **Special Relativity** (1907) and **Ggeneral relativity** (1917).

### 1) **Special Relativity**

Imagine you are on a **train**, and you throw a ball straight up while moving forward quickly.

**Time and space seem to change when objects are moving at different speeds!**

Here are key points to keep in mind:

* **Time is not an independent entity**, it depends on your frame of reference!
* **Objects appear shorter or longer**, and time passes differently when observed at high-speeds.

To illustrate: If you were to ask your fellow passenger on the train to measure time and distance as you threw that ball, you both would likely give different answers!

### 1.5) **Time and Space are Relative**

For example, let's say you and your best friend live on opposite sides of a globe. You each hold a watch and meet exactly at midnight to see who started first. Now you move to a spaceship traveling near light speed and return later.

Whoa! When you arrive at home, your clock will show a different time than your friend's! Why? Because **Time passed differently on your spaceship**, even though you didn't feel it.

This effect gets bigger at greater speeds.

### 3) **Gravity Warps Time and Space**

According to General Relativity, **mass warps spacetime around it**.

Think about throwing rocks near a bowling ball on a trampoline:

A) Place a bowling ball on a trampoline and watch what happens to marbles rolling across â€“ **They curve toward the bowling ball** due to mass warping spacetime.

B) Now think about a star or black hole instead of a bowling ball... **Gravity acts similarly, curving the paths of objects and even bending light!**<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,518.4179742336273

However, I must clarify that there's no such virus as lasso virus.

If you meant something else, could you please provide context or clarify which virus you are looking at? I'll be glad assist you.

If not, I can suggest information regarding other viruses' genoms.

Also you may want to know that Lassa fever is an infectious disease caused by Lassa virus, it is an RNA virus of negative strand, its single strand RNA molecule contains 190 kilobases, divided into 4 main genes, coding for nucleoprotein, glycoprotein, matrix protein and polymerase protein. 

Please let me know what else I can help with! I am here to assist! 

(P.S. If you have any questions or need clarification regarding Lassa virus, feel free to ask)<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,90.48886775970459
