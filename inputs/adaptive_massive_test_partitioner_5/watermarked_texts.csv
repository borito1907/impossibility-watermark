To calculate or identify values at specific indices, such as finding values at certain peripherical (edge) indices of an existing 1D or 3D numpy arrays, you can use NumPY's slicing and/or boolean masks.

However, when we typically think about perimeters, it usually refers to images, matrices, arrays. Thus I'll assume that for calculating 'perimeter', we are looking for values present at boundaries of array.


Here is an example code snippet:

```python 
import numpy as np

# Create an example array.
data = np.arange(25).reshape((5,5))
print(""Original Array:\n"", data)

def find_perimeter(array):
    if len(data.shape)!=2:
        raise ValueError('This only works for two-dimensional arrays.')

    rows,columns=data.shape
    # Find top and bottom periphery
    top_edge=array[0,:]
    bottom_edge=array[-1,:]

    # Find first and last element of each middle line to represent right and left periphery 
   
    middle_edges=np.zeros((rows-2,2))

    for index in range(rows - 2):
       middle_edges[index][0] = array[index,0]
       middle_edges[index][1] =array[index,-1]

   # Stack all periphery together
    edges =np.vstack([top_edge,m middle_edges,bottom_edge]).ravel()
    return(edges)
edges = find_perimeter(data)
    
print('\nPeriphery Values:',edges )

```

Note: The `ravel()` function returns flattened version of given numpy multi-dimentional array. This is used to transform multi dimensional array to one dimensional array.
