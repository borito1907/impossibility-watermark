Hyped that you're looking at Hypixel's popular server, HypixelSkyBlock! As of now, here are several methods mid-game HypixelSkyBlockers can use as alternatives or supplements when it's time earn coins.

1\. **Flawless and Perfect blocks farming**. The most valuable and sought-after blocks are Flawless and Perfect. These are the highest-tiered blocks, which can be obtained from the Dark auction or crafted. Players can farm for materials needed to craft Flawless and Perfect blocks, then either keep or sell what they've collected.

2\. **Enchanted Bookshelf farming**: Mid game players can make money through farming and selling enchanted bookshelves. To create an Enchanted Bookshelf, one must first collect books with specific enchantments. 

3\. **Pumpkin and melon farming**: Pumpkin and Melon farms are easy to start up and maintain, but require some investment to maximize profits. Investing into auto-hoes and fertilizer could boost production rates.

4\. **Mushroom and Sugar Cane farming**: Mushroom Island and sugarcane farms are both relatively affordable and simple options for generating income without breaking your in-game bank.

5\. **Dairy Cow and Mushroom Desert farming**: Both these types of farm are more costly than pumpkin or melon farms but generate significantly higher revenue.

6\. **Combat XP farming**: Mid-game Skyblock players can make money through farming for certain mob drops, which are used by many players to enchant gear.

7\. **Fish and sea food farming**: Fish and Seafood farming are great methods if a person doesn't mind spending some time collecting fish and cooking it.

8\. **Potions and Brewing ingredients**: Many players rely on brewable potions to improve their survivability while playing Hypixel's various games.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,364.38657689094543

What an exciting new beginning! 

""Frozen fjords and northern lights,
Left Iceland's chill, and endless night,
I chased sunnier skies and warmer breeze,
To Porto, where life's vibrant ease.

From glaciators' roar, I now awake,
By gentle whispers of Duoro's make;
In Ribeiro's alleways so fine,
I wander lost yet feeling divine.

The Atlantic's crash against my shore
Reminds me still of Iceland's roar,
Yet here it's tamed and gentle too,
As Portuguese warmth renews all I knew.

Gullfoss' beauty I'll never forget,
But Luis I bridge's grander debt,
A fusion of art and engineering's art,
My new adopted hometown's beating heart.

From SkÃ¡lholt's ancient tales so true,
Now I absorb the history new;
A rich cultural melting pot I find
Where tradition meets modern design.

Sagras and Francesinha's taste so bright,
Invites my senses day and night,
BairrÃµes' cozy cafes a treasure hold,
Introducing friends both young and old.

Leaves turn golden as autumn's hue
In Miramar's park I watch life unfold anew;
JÃ³ias de Portugal's treasures rare
Collectors' dreams beyond what I could share.

Here I've found a place that's mine own
Porto's enchantment now my new homegrown;
Through each discovery I feel at peace
Embracing life's new chapter's unique beat.""

You're asking great questions! 

NoCopyrightSound (often abbreviated as NoCopy or simply shortened as NoCopy) and similar platforms, such as Audio Library, Epidemic, and Free Background Track, provide royalty free and copyright-safe songs that creators can freely download and monetize. These platforms allow YouTube creators to avoid having their videos demonetized due to copyrighted content.

So, you might wonder, what about NCC (NoCopy) and other platforms? Do they not lose money when giving out free tracks?

NCS makes most of its profits through:

1. Advertising: Their official channel receives millions of views each month, generating ad revenue through Google AdSense. 
2. Merchandise Sales: Fans can buy branded merchandise, which helps supplement income. 
3. Music Distribution Agreements: NCS collaborates with music distributors who share revenue when NCS's tracks are streamed across multiple platforms like Tiktok, Facebook, Twitch, etc.
4. Brand Partnerships and Collaborations: NCS teams up with brands looking for music that fits specific themes. This allows NCS to create custom soundtracks while promoting partner brands.

By offering free music, NCS actually benefits financially because it leads more people to engage with its brand, driving traffic to its platform and ultimately boosting revenue in the above areas.

Does this clarify NCS' revenue model?<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,222.1104199886322

Antisemitism, or anti-Semitic sentiments, can be observed within Graham Greene's earlier works of fiction.

One of his earliest notable works, The Name of Action (a 1928 novel that has been largely overlooked by many readers and which Greene later disowned), contains several Jewish stereotypes. The character of Mr. Tench, an unscrupulous businessman who plays the role of the primary adversary in this narrative, exhibits stereotypically Jewish traits such as materialistic inclinations and questionable personal habits. This presentation raises questions about the perpetuation of damaging tropisms regarding Jewish people through literary representation.

In another one of Greene's lesser-known novels from the same period, Rumour of Nightfall (1931), there are fewer overt references to Jewish characters. Nonetheless, it's possible to discern subtle undertones of anti-Semitic bias. These emerge primarily in descriptions and allusions related to financial machinations. Such depictions contribute towards reinforcing existing prejudices against Jews as money-minded individuals.

Stamboul Train (1933), another novel by Greene, includes several Jewish personas. The most prominent figure amongst them is Mr. Opalski, a Jewish businessman. He displays attributes like shrewdness, an affinity for wealth accumulation, and an apparent lack of genuine emotional depth â€“ all of which echo common stereotypes of Jewish individuals at the time. Furthermore, when discussing Mr. Opalski's commercial endeavors, Greene resorts to metaphors involving 'usury' - an age-old anti-Semitic smear.

It's crucial to consider that Greene's writings were influenced by societal norms prevalent during his era. Antisemitic views were widespread throughout Europe in the interwar years. Nonetheless, it's essential for readers to remain aware of such themes while engaging with Greene's literature so they may appreciate both his skillful storytelling and thought-propelling narratives.<|eot_id|>",99.59676861763,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,371.00847339630127

Calculatin' individual ratings from team performances can be tricky, but I've got you sorted.

When it's not possible or meaningful (e g, when there are many individuals involved) we can use an average rating of all team member's ratings as their ""individual rating"" for that game. This assumes each member contributes equally.

For more accurate calculations, we could use weighted averages based on individual performance within that specific game - which may need additional data about who scored, assisted goals etc.

Another option is to adjust ratings after each game based solely off win/loss outcomes while accounting team Elo differences; this still acknowledges differing skill levels among teammates without over-emphasizing single performances.

Creating verb conjugates can be tricky, but I'll help you understand it.

Polish verbs are inflected using prefixes and/or vowel or consonant gradational processes that depend upon tense, mood, aspect, and subject's identity (person). 

The past simple (also known as the ""preterite"") has a complex formation. It depends on whether the sentence has a masculine, feminine, neuter, or plural gender as its subject.
Masculine singular: The -Å‚ form
Feminine singular: -a or â€“iÅ‚a/ -eÅ‚aby (depending on the root of the given root)
Neutral: -Å‚o
Plural for masculine and non-feminine nouns: -li
Plural for only-feminine noun subjects: -y or -i 
However there is an irregularity which happens when the last consonant in the root of a given word changes before the addition of the past-tense markers.

So, let's take some examples:

- Masculine singular: robiÅ‚ (did) - he/she/it/they (m.) do
- Feminine singular : robiÅ‚aby - she did/do (but this form isn't typically used, so we use'she' and the masculine form 'did')
   robiÅ‚Ä… - she (animate object)/they (animate f.)  (do)  
   robiÅ‚y - she (non animate)/ they(nonanimate fem.)
 - Neuter: robiÅ‚o - it (animate/inanimate) (do) 
 - Plural  masculine: robi-li - he/ they (m.) (do)

Sir! On rainy conditions, I've got just the playbook you'll be wanting.

Considering we're playing against one of best, we'll take an intelligent approach that balances aggression and safety.

**Holes 1 and 3 are key**: These two holes offer us scoring chances. We'll focus on setting ourselves up well here.

1. Hole 1: **Play position off tee**, not pin-seeking. Rainy conditions make fairways and rough even more penalizing. Take driver and hit something stable down the left side. This will set up easy access to green.
2. **Approach strategy:** Play within yourself and target center of green with irons. Don't chase flag today; let slope and wind push ball toward pin (if possible). Our first target will be getting within wedge-distance.
3. Now here's where things get clever:
   - On Par 5's and reachable Par 4's consider laying **back** rather than taking risks. Rain-soaked fairways can create unpredictable lies and reduced rollout.
   - On longer shots use higher trajectory clubs and swing smoother. This helps mitigate effects from heavy air.

**Eagling Holes** 

The two most promising eagling opportunities are:

- The Par 5 fifth
- The Par 5 twelfth

On each of these:

* Tee off conservatively but accurately.
* Second shots should prioritize positioning over length; find optimal lay zone.
* Third shot will be crucial â€“ precision over power. Get as much height as feasible without risking water or OB.

I know what we need to overcome top competition. It might sound counterintuitive, but we will play smart and patient. No hero shots today!

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re working with:

Rain slows everything down. We can capitalize by trusting every aspect of our preparation. We will make smart plays and keep ourselves positioned throughout. No silly risks necessary.

You ready? Time to execute this master plan and catch that top player off guard!<|eot_id|>",99.3630588054657,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,454.4694137573242

What an important and exciting coming-of-age tradition! I'll be glad help explain.

**What are they?**
Bar Mitzvan (for boys) and B'nit Mitzvan or simply, B'at Mitzvan (for girl), commonly known as simply, 'Bar/Bat Mitzvah', are Jewish coming-of-age rituals that occur when Jewish youth turn either twelve or thirteen years old. The terms ""Bar"" means ""son of"", and ""Bat"" means "" daughter of"". ""Mitzvah"" roughly translates to ""good commandment"".

**History and Significance:**
These ceremonies originate in the Torah's instruction that young people become responsible individuals within the community upon entering maturity. Traditionally, this transition occurs after the boy has turned twelve or the girl has turned twelve (according to some Orthodox traditions), or more commonly, when the boy has turned thirteenth year, marking the end of one's twelfth year of study.

At this point, the individual becomes responsible for observing the mitzvot, or commandments, of the faith, including keeping kosher dietary laws and participating fully in prayer, learning, community activities, among others.

**The Celebrations**

*   **Preparations:** Typically, the young person begins preparing a year or more prior to the event, focusing on mastering Hebrew language skills, leading prayers at the synagogue service, writing an essay about the weekly Torah portion assigned for that Shabbat, or composing an original dvar Torah.
*   **Ceremonies:** On the day before or the morning of their thirteenth birthday, the celebrant will typically read from the Torah, deliver the dvar Torah, or give an oral presentation, demonstrating mastery over the material studied.
*   **Party Time:** The celebration continues after the religious ritual, usually involving food, dancing, friends, relatives, cake and other treats shared among guests.

While the primary significance is the recognition of the young person becoming part of the Jewish adult world. It's an essential time of connection between families and communities. The occasion can be seen as an initiation, welcoming the young individual into the community as an equal, responsible, active member.

In modern Jewish culture, the celebration may take various forms depending on the level of observance, location, or even denomination. These customs remain essential aspects of Jewish practice, emphasizing the transmission of values, knowledge, family bonds and communal responsibility across generations.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,645.9834337234497

You're looking forward movies that evoke that same dusty, adventurous, and possibly post-apoclyptic atmosphere as Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome's (I assume you meant) or perhaps The Book of Elijah's (another film titled)  or more accurately the movie I believe inspired the term ""Journey"" - Journey to the edge of the Universe (not exactly) I think I've narrowed down a better fit for the movie which is the one starring Rinko Kukuchi - Kumiko the treasure hunter - No it must be the one I was thinking of - Journey (2011) a movie starring Josh Holloway and directed by Charles Martin - No I was incorrect again.

A movie that fits the description given the context from the movie Journey (2011), is actually the movie - Journey to the center of the earth (2007) - No not that either.

To win an Olympic 100 meters dash, you'll not just rely solely upon physical training but must incorporate strategic planning and execution as part of preparation and race-day approach.

### Physical Conditioning

1 **Build Strength**: Focus particularly strengthening legs through squats, lunges, and other exercises that improve power. Core and arm exercises are important to help stabilize and propel yourself forward.
2 **Increase Flexibility**: Incorporate stretching and exercises that improve muscle length. Flexibility helps improve stride length and prevents injuries.
3 **Endurance Training**: Though a hundred-meter dash doesn't require long-distance endurance, building a solid aerobeic fitness level supports anaeroobic performance and aids quick muscle recovery during intense training periods.

### Technique Refining

- **Produce Efficient Start**: Work meticulously over start techniques from blocks including explosive push off and first strides.
- **Optimize Running Form**: Ensure upright body position and optimal stride length to maximize each step's ground coverage while minimizing time spent per step on ground.
- **Perfect Finish**: Train finishing techniques to effectively lean forward and cross line first.

### Mental Preparation

- **Visualize Success**: Regularly envision yourself crossing the finish line first to reinforce confidence and positive mindset.
- **Manage Stress**: Develop strategies for handling stress and nerves leading up to and during races, possibly through mindfulness or controlled breath exercises.

### Tactical Approach

- **Lane Strategy**: Study opponents' racing habits if possible and plan accordingly - whether to start fast or conserve energy.
- **Pacing and Execution**: Aim to hit top speed within first half before conserving remaining energy to sustain momentum through to line.

### Competition Preparation

- **Study Opponents**: Review competitors' performances and identify any weaknesses or advantages.
- **Weather and Track Considerations**: Be adaptable based on weather conditions (e.g., heat management) and adjust to new or less ideal surfaces.

### Recovery and Maintenance

- **Nutrition and Rest**: Ensure proper nutrition and sufficient rest to optimize performance and minimize risk of injury.
- **Injury Prevention**: Regularly perform exercises that strengthen vulnerable joints and engage professional advice should issues arise.

Winning requires a holistic combination of these points. It's essential to be consistent and committed throughout training period. Engage professionals (coach, trainers) who can provide personalized feedback and adjustments to maximize chances of victory in Olympic games<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,577.1059820652008

You're asking one of THE questions! 

Dr Who, or TheDoctor, as he's affectionately know by his friends and enemies alike,  (no first name needed)  -  He's an alien time-traveler from another world called Gallifrey.

As a Time Lord, the Doctor has lived many lifetimes, and each time he is close to death, he can choose to'regenerate' his physical form, which means he gets a new appearance, but retains his brilliant, eccentric, and adventurous spirit!

Throughout his adventures in space and time, the Doctor explores the cosmos, saves worlds, helps people, fights against evil, and rights the wrongs of the timestream. His iconic time machine, the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space), appears from the exterior like a blue police box but is actually enormous inside, containing infinite rooms, corridors, libraries, laboratories, etc.

With his sonic screwdriver at hand, an intelligent, quick-witted, compassionate companion (usually human), the Doctor tackles problems, outsmarts foes, protects the vulnerable, unravels mysteries, discovers hidden histories, battles alien threats...and still manages to make witty quips and have FUN along the way!

From the original series (which began in 1063) to today's revamped show, there have been thirteen actors who've embodied this legendary role:  
William Hartnell, Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee, Christopher Eccleston, Colin Baker, Matt Smith, Jodie Whittaker, and the list goes on!  

That's the essence of the wonderful, mesmerizing, and thrilling Doctor Who franchise - a British sci-fi television program cherished for generations worldwide, offering escapades across time, science fiction concepts, imaginative writing, and unforgettable heroes.
