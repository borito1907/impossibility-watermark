Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Review the patient's medical history,1996 health status to ensure they are eligible for vaccination.
* Ensure the patient has signed a consent form (if required).
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.
* Prepare the vaccination area by laying out necessary supplies.

II. Vaccine Selection and Preparation

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine for the patient based on their age, other health conditions (e.g., high-dose vaccine for seniors).
* Check the expiration date and storage conditions of the vaccine.
* Follow proper procedures for handling and storing vaccines.
