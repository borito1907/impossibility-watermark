A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects.

So, what's the big deal about this theorem?

Given a right-angled triangle (a triangle with one 90-degree angle), the Pythagorean Theorem states that:

a² + b² = c²

where a and b are the lengths of the legs (the sides adjacent to the right angle), and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects.

So, what's the big deal about this theorem?

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides."
