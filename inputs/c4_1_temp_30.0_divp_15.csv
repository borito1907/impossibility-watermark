That is correct!

As a member of the United States Senate, a U.S. Senator has several key responsibilities:

1. **Propose and vote on laws**: Senators introduce, debate, and vote on bills that can become federal laws.
2. **Serve on committees**: Senators are assigned to various committees, which focus on specific policy areas, such as agriculture, finance, or foreign relations. They review legislation, hold hearings, and conduct investigations related to their committee's jurisdiction.
3. **Represent their state's interests in Congress**: Senators act as representatives of their state, advocating for its needs, concerns, and priorities at the national level.
