Handling customer complaints about defective products is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction, a positive brand reputation, and reducing the risk of negative reviews. Here are some effective strategies for handling such situations:

1. **Listen Actively**: When a customer complains, (via phone, a message on social media, A chat window or in-person), listen attentively to their concerns. Ask open-ended questions to clarify the issue,and ensure you understand the problem.

2. **Acknowledge and Apologize**: Respond promptly,ing to the customer, expressing regret for the inconvenience they've experienced. This demonstrates that you value their business and care about their satisfaction.

3. **Gather Information**: Request details about the product, (order number, purchase date,and the specific issue). This helps you investigate and resolve the matter efficiently.
