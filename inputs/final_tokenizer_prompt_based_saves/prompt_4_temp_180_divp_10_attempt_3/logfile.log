**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem, also known as Pythagoras' Theorem, A² + B² = C², states that in a right-angled triangle (one angle is 90 degrees), the square of the length of the hypotenuse side (C) is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides (A and B).

The Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental concept in mathematics, a cornerstone of geometry, and a timeless tool for problem-solvers everywhere.

So,198 So, you want to know about its significance? Here's the rundown:

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem, also known as Pythagoras' Theorem, A² + B² = C², states that in a right-angled triangle (one angle is 90 degrees), the square of the length of the hypotenuse side (C) is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides (A and B).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance calculations:** The theorem enables us to calculate distances between points in 2D and 3D spaces.

The Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental concept in mathematics, a cornerstone of geometry, and a timeless tool for problem-solvers everywhere.

So,198 So, you want to know about its significance? Here's the rundown:

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem, also known as Pythagoras' Theorem, A² + B² = C², states that in a right-angled triangle (one angle is 90 degrees), the square of the length of the hypotenuse side (C) is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides (A and B).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance calculations:** The theorem enables us to calculate distances between points in 2D and 3D spaces. This has far-reaching implications in fields like physics, engineering, architecture, and computer science.

2. **Triangle properties:** The theorem reveals properties of triangles, and facilitates calculation of angles, heights, and areas.

A great topic in geometry!

The Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental concept in mathematics, a cornerstone of geometry, and a timeless tool for problem-solvers everywhere.

So,198 So, you want to know about its significance? Here's the rundown:

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem, also known as Pythagoras' Theorem, A² + B² = C², states that in a right-angled triangle (one angle is 90 degrees), the square of the length of the hypotenuse side (C) is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides (A and B).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance calculations:** The theorem enables us to calculate distances between points in 2D and 3D spaces. This has far-reaching implications in fields like physics, engineering, architecture, and computer science.

2. **Triangle properties:** The theorem reveals properties of triangles, and facilitates calculation of angles, heights, and areas. This leads to deeper understandings of spatial relationships and trigonometry.

3. **Analytical geometry:** By employing the theorem, coordinates can be calculated for points on shapes: circle arcs ellipses parabolas etc.
