A fascinating topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem, one of the most well-known and fundamental concepts in geometry, theorems. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

**"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."**

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of the right-angled triangle (the sides that meet at the right angle), and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

A fascinating topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem, one of the most well-known and fundamental concepts in geometry, theorems. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

**"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."**

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of the right-angled triangle (the sides that meet at the right angle), and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance and Length**: The theorem allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.
2. **Area and Volume**: By using the theorem, we can find the area and volume of various geometric shapes like triangles, even when some dimensions are unknown.

The Pythagorean Theorem, one of the most well-known and fundamental concepts in geometry, theorems. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

**"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."**

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of the right-angled triangle (the sides that meet at the right angle), and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance and Length**: The theorem allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.
2. **Area and Volume**: By using the theorem, we can find the area and volume of various geometric shapes like triangles, even when some dimensions are unknown.
3. **Similarity and Congruence**: The theorem helps determine whether two triangles are similar or congruent ( identical).
