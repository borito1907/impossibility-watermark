1. Creation of new job opportunities: As companies transition to a more environmentally-friendly set-up, by investing in ecofriendly practices they will create several jobs.

2. Encourage business growth and innovation: With environmental regulations incentivizing firms to adapt and innovate technology around sustainable development can result in cost-effective solutions or better production processes resulting.

3. Stimulate Economic Growth: An environmentally driven economy often requires capital-intensive investments that bring economic expansion and growth thereby benefiting the entire community.

Disadvantages :
5.Impose increased costs and regulations to small businesses potentially creating obstacles that might cause business to stagnate causing unemployment as businesses close up due to unaffordable regulations.
