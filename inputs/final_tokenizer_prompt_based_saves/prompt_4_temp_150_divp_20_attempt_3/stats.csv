The theorem states: ""In a right-angled triangle, a² + b² = c²"" (read as 'a-squared plus b-squared equals c-squared').

",True,7,"5,2",True,1
70,"**

Given a right-angled triangle with legs of length 'a' and 'b', and a hypotenuse (the longest side) of length 'c', the theorem states:

a² + b² = c²

In simpler terms: ""If you square the lengths of the two shorter sides and add those values together, to power them, to make one or the other positive number larger by squaring the quantity), the result is equal to the square of the longest side.""

",True,1,"5,2",True,2

Given a right triangle (an angle that is 90 degrees), the Pythagorean Theorem states that:

_a² + b² = c²_

where:
_a_ is the length of the base (the leg adjacent to the right angle)
_b_ is the length of the height (the leg opposite the right angle)
_c_ is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

In other words, it says that when you square the lengths of the two shorter sides (base and height) of a right triangle, (add them together), the result is equal to the squared length of the longest side (hypotenuse).
