1. **Listen Actively**: When a customer complains, listen attentively to their concern, (avoid interrupting), and acknowledge their frustration. This shows empathy and understanding.

2. **Gather Information**: Ask open-ended questions to gather more details about the issue, including the product's serial number, purchase date, and how they've been using it. This helps identify the root cause.

3. **Apologize Sincerely**: Offer a genuine apology for the inconvenience caused by the defective product. This demonstrates your commitment to making things right.

4. **Empower Employees**: Give frontline staff the authority to resolve issues promptly. This might include offering replacements, refunds, or repairs.

5. **Provide Solutions**: Present the customer with potential solutions, such as replacing the product, offering a store credit, or fixing the issue through a repair service. Be transparent about the process and any timelines involved.

6. **Follow-up**: After resolving the issue, check in with the customer to ensure they're satisfied with the outcome. This demonstrates your dedication to their satisfaction and helps rebuild trust.

7. **Document and Analyze**: Log the complaint and its resolution in your database.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
