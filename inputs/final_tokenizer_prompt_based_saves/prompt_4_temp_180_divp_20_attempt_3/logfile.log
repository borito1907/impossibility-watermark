 Significance:

1 **Geometric Representation: 2 **Calculations : In simple terms the theorem enables us to find missing sides by taking into account other sides measurements The squares of two perpendicular and opposite side 'b c length are the length measurements respectively which added up becomes equal the square longest known hypotenuse

In mathematical formula that would be A² B² C²   a² b²=  c²  (where denotes) the squared side length and denotes)

2 Measurement Flexibility - Due Pythagoras contributions the discovery facilitates multiple ways measuring any kind   angle given information Using this you not be concerned having measurements each part Instead use measurements from adjacent known lengths or solve   trigonometrical

3 Relationship - It exposes an extraordinary connection existing between   triangular structures enabling one understand and visualize geometric relationships Consequently many theoretical discoveries made possible

Real Applications - Its presence spans many diverse fields  1 - Architecture   building designs rely on these for constructing bridges buildings towers accurate computations ensure   strong foundations

The Pythagorean Theorem! It's a fundamental concept in geometry, for good reason. Named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, of Samos (c. 570-496 BCE), it has far-reaching implications and applications across various fields. Let me highlight its significance:

**1. Calculate Hypotenuse**: The theorem allows us to easily calculate the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) in a right-angled triangle using the lengths of the other two sides ( legs).
