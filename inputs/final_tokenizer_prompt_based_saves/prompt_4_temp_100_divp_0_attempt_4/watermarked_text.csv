The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, of sizes and positions of objects. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

In simple terms, the theorem states:

""In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.""

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs (two sides that meet at a right angle), and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the third side).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance and Length Calculations**: The theorem allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or any other side of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides. This has numerous applications in various fields like architecture, engineering, physics, and computer graphics.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
