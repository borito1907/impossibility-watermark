 Handling customer complaints about defective products can be challenging, A productive approach involves active listening,/raw, that you need to acknowledge empathetically customers concerns while also working efficiently to resolve their case Here here are some strategies

Listening and Acknowledging Empathetically:
•	respond promptly customers contact acknowledging receive receipt with their concern in mind that it conveys to respond the fact that value and care for their issue 
• Active listening: Repeat & paraphrase issue for better understanding Ensure customer feels heard It is essential to be able recognize that empathy doesn’t mean agreeing rather demonstrating you understand/ their side/and perspectives 

Asking Questions  Collecting Information: 

Ask open-ended Qstn gather all   to know exact nature problem identify root cause It will help determine how address concern Gather facts of purchase Product description When did the defect appear Were following provided instructions Were usage outside parameters?
