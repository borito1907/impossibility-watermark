The theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with legs of length a and b, and a hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of length c:

a² + b² = c²

In simpler terms, this means that if you square the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle and add them together, the result is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the third side).

A great topic! 

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications in various fields, it applies to. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications in various fields, it applies to. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides forming the right angle (legs of the triangle), and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

A great topic! 

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications in various fields, it applies to. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides forming the right angle (legs of the triangle), and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance and Length Calculations**: The theorem allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or one of the legs of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides. This is crucial in solving problems involving distances, rectangles, triangles, and many more.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications in various fields, it applies to. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a² + b² = c²

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides forming the right angle (legs of the triangle), and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).
