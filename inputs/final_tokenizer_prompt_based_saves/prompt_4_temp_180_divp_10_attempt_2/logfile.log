The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right-angled triangle with perpendicular sides of length a and b, (forming a 90-degree angle) and a hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of length c:

a² + b² = c²

This theorem holds true for all right triangles,1⃣p and allows us to calculate lengths, especially the third side (hypotenuse), given the other two.

The renowned Pythagorean Theorem!

In geometry, the Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept that has far-reaching implications and numerous practical applications. It's a cornerstone of Euclidean geometry, which describes the properties of flat spaces.

**What does it say?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right-angled triangle with perpendicular sides of length a and b, (forming a 90-degree angle) and a hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of length c:

a² + b² = c²

This theorem holds true for all right triangles,1⃣p and allows us to calculate lengths, especially the third side (hypotenuse), given the other two.

The renowned Pythagorean Theorem!

In geometry, the Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept that has far-reaching implications and numerous practical applications. It's a cornerstone of Euclidean geometry, which describes the properties of flat spaces.

**What does it say?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right-angled triangle with perpendicular sides of length a and b, (forming a 90-degree angle) and a hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of length c:

a² + b² = c²

This theorem holds true for all right triangles,1⃣p and allows us to calculate lengths, especially the third side (hypotenuse), given the other two.
