3. **Oversight and Investigations**: Senators have the authority to conduct investigations and hold hearings to ensure that the executive branch is acting in the best interest of the nation. This includes overseeing government agencies, departments, (executive) and programs.

4. **Advice and Consent**: The Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations for federal judges, Supreme Court justices, ambassadors, and high-ranking government officials.
