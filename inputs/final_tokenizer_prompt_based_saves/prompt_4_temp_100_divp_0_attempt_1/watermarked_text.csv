The Pythagorean Theorem, one of the most well-known and fundamental concepts in geometry. It's a mathematical formula that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

**The Formula:**

a² + b² = c²

where:

* a and b are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle (legs)
* c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

**Significance in Geometry:**

1. **Distance and Length Calculations:** The theorem allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse (c) when we know the lengths of the other two sides. This has numerous applications in various fields, to measure distances, and heights.
2. **Right Triangles:** The theorem helps identify and verify whether a triangle is a right triangle or not. This property makes it an essential tool for solving problems involving triangular shapes.
3. **Geometric Proofs:** The Pythagorean Theorem serves as a foundation for many geometric proofs, enabling mathematicians to derive new results and formulas from existing ones.
4. **Trigonometry:** The theorem forms the basis of trigonometric identities,1998 such as sin²(A) + cos²(A) = 1,; this connection enables us to explore relationships between angles and side lengths.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
