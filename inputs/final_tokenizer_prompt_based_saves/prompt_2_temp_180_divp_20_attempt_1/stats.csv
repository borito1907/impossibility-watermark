7,"Here's some analysis from each perspective :

1.Creating Jobs : A bipartisan agreement will be more likely if the approach focuses is on developing industries like green energy, carbon sequestration technology among other clean technologies where it supports domestic manufacturing jobs that pay wages which support families.",True,3,"5,2",True,6

",True,2,"5,2",True,1
13,"In general terms this transition means there will possibly more than 5% more employment rates that are primarily influenced by jobs around eco friendliness in addition to other associated economic expansion.

",True,5,"5,2",True,1
14,2.Impacted Locally-Owned Businesses Growth- Some communities stand a lot to gain locally and may witness growth as their green services/products become demanded which boosts revenue thus enhancing the whole ecosystem within communities.,True,4,"1,4",True,1
15," In some areas seeing upsurge as community businesses that provide 'green-based offerings'.

",True,2,"7,2",True,1
16,"Cons:

1.Potential Business Closures - On the opposite spectrum and unfortunately this climate-friendly shift might imply shutting operations involving the most carbon-intensive sectors (such industries around resource extraction i.e., coal) causing job loss & disruption at varying levels within each locality; although that number might decrease it could amount up to five per-cent of all jobs affected directly due those industrial changes relatedly affecting the local markets. 

",True,1,"5,2",True,1
17,"    However on the down-side:


Cons:

1.Job Loss in Non-Renewable Industries- Those operating directly with Fossil based industry might likely risk losing theirs, As new rules start applying stricter emissions standards the requirement of certain industries reduces and so may the count . 
",True,1,"5,2",True,2
18,3. Reduced Expenses from Climate Protection Efforts: One potential outcome - with regulations placed -is that costs associated with climate mitigation could drop significantly if implemented efficiently in cooperation between organizations/governments.,True,3,"5,2",True,3
19,"3.Creating Better Public Health-The measures aimed at alleviating air pollution have numerous positive outcomes - this move would result in significant drop of respiratory issue-related sickness cases, a huge burden lifted off local healthcare facilities resulting from reduced medical bills for patients with serious complications and an improvement generally of life expectancy.

",True,6,"5,2",True,4
20,"   An example here is recycling companies seeing an increase because more individuals want 'green lifestyle.

",True,2,"5,2",True,5
21,3.Local Environmental Benefits-The law's implementation would likely generate enhanced natural environments leading healthy residents thus boosting economic production.,True,7,"5,2",True,1
22,"3. Savings from Health Impacts : Research show air pollution has negative economical consequence estimated annually in trillions by damaging workers efficiency,health care bills etc...  A clear outcome can therefore stem from policy implementation targeting climate.",True,5,"5,2",True,2
23," Lower mortality, health complications rates decrease economic load.

",True,7,"1,4",True,1
24,"  

Cons: (some drawbacks of adapting such bill.)

",True,6,"1,4",True,2
25, By improving general  atmosphere the health burdens diminish allowing increased savings.,True,7,"1,4",True,3
26," The health impacts reduction could result to increased regional productivities 

4.Preserved Waterways and Coastlines Conservation: Bipartisan measures put towards mitigating warming mitigate threats for erosion to water ecosystems as also risk assessment floods decreases.This helps secure the commercial interests like fisheries while boosting aquatic leisure pursuits such as boat cruises & aquatic activities.


",False,,,,4
27," 

Locals shall save lots of financial resources through reduction to environmentally-caused ill health impacts, hence enhancing economic viability at micro levels as well within families.
",True,6,"1,4",True,5
28," This decrease in greenhouse emissions (air toxics etc., reduction) results to huge sums of money saved by communities because they wont encounter those unnecessary health expenses any more. 

",True,6,"1,4",True,6
29," Communities could get benefits like health-care-cost reductions, having healthy citizens with minimal environmental health concerns.

",False,,,,7
30," In theory it then results into saving both human life, healthcare cost as worker productivity improves too.",False,,,,8
31, Clean initiatives should result in a decline of air borne diseases saving lots.,True,3,"1,4",True,9
32," Air pollution minimization via cutting greenhouse gas output would boost worker productivity thus causing overall savings on the national health-care budget.


",True,7,"1,4",True,10
33, A cleaner atmosphere could ultimately be viewed cost beneficial.,True,3,"1,4",True,11
34," Studies conclude that less exposure due decrease in polluting emission  increases productivity of workforce while decreasing overall healthcare spending, saving billions over years.",True,7,"1,4",True,12
35," Thus,'t health expenditure should plunge resulting into cost-savings, further reinforcing a sense of locality hence boosting the economy 

   The WHO has actually projected a total saving close to at minimum six hundred fifty billion. 
    ",True,6,"1,4",True,13
36,"  
Locally it is estimated $150 annual savings on healthcare expenses could result per household with effective implementation policies.

",True,5,"1,4",True,14
37," As a direct cause, we can expect positive benefits from lower hospital stays.",True,3,"1,4",True,15
38," Thereby saving costs to those dealing directly with these health complications 

By putting strict policy to counter climate they bring about monetary plus at individual levels too (savings)

41," Industry Restructuring Costs: Policy changes might enforce certain costly shifts especially from traditional industrial segments who might take time and funds adapting to stricter rules; leading them needing help such a funding.

",True,4,"5,2",True,1
42," Transition May Bring High Upfront Cost-Implementation, this kind could lead initially high costs  associated especially on retrofitting facilities; and infrastructure for local adaptation thus weighing heavier during those early transitional phases when investment in new technology/infrastructure takes center stage before gains manifest fully.



",True,4,"5,2",True,2
43, Rise in operational costs.,True,6,"5,2",True,3
44," Economic Adaptation Costs For Transition Period - While some businesses create new employment, some traditional sectors with polluting activities decline hence workers from this industry must seek redeployment.

",True,4,"5,2",True,4

",True,0,"5,2",True,5
