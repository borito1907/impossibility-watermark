Given a right-angled triangle (a triangle with one angle of 90 degrees), the Pythagorean Theorem states:

a² + b² = c²

where:

* a and b are the lengths of the two sides forming the right angle (legs of the triangle)
* c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

Given a right-angled triangle (a triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees), the theorem states that:

a² + b² = c²

where:

* a and b are the lengths of the legs (the two sides that meet at the right angle)
* c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

In simpler terms, it means that if you square the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, a positive number, the result will be equal to the square of the longest side (hypotenuse).

The theorem states that for any right-angled triangle, to find the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle):

a² + b² = c²

where:

* a and b are the lengths of the two sides forming the right angle ( legs or catheti)
* c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

In essence, it relates the squares of the lengths of the two sides to the square of the hypotenuse.

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."


[2024-06-20 15:31:20,877][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where:
a and b are the lengths of the legs (the sides adjacent to the right angle)
c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Distance and Measurement**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate distances and lengths in geometric shapes, particularly in right triangles.

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where:
a and b are the lengths of the legs (the sides adjacent to the right angle)
c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Distance and Measurement**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate distances and lengths in geometric shapes, particularly in right triangles. This has numerous applications in fields like architecture, to ensure stability and accuracy in construction plans.

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570 - c. 495 BCE), who is credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

"In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where:
a and b are the lengths of the legs (the sides adjacent to the right angle)
c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Distance and Measurement**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate distances and lengths in geometric shapes, particularly in right triangles. This has numerous applications in fields like architecture, to ensure stability and accuracy in construction plans.
2. **Geometry and Trigonometry**: The Pythagorean Theorem is essential for solving problems involving right triangles, which are crucial components of more complex geometric shapes.
