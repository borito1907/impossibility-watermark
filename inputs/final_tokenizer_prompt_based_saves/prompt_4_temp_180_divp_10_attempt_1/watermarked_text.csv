1,"A brilliant question!

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry,etics, one of the earliest and most famous results in geometry.

Given a right-angled triangle with legs of length a and b, A2 b2 C2), the theorem states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs (a² + b²) is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c²):

`a² + b² = c²`

Now, for the signifance part:

 **Calculating distances:** Pythagoras' theorem allows us to calculate the distance between two points on a coordinate plane by forming a right-triangle with sides equaling the x-axe distance abthe ` difference, the theorem computes that y-axis  gives `you hypotenue`).distance.

**Real-world applications:**

1. **Architecture**: Accurately calculating distances helps architects determine building dimensions beam lengths etc designing houses bridge roofs roads

2. **Physics & Engineering**: Understanding trigometry triangular laws help engineers design safer stronger bridges and physicists solve projectile motion-related issues

3. **Computer Graphics ** : Visualizing  graphics (images) objects scenes require calculating distance position and orientation making it central
