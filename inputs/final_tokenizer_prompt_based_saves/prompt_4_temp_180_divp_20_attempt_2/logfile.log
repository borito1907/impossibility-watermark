The Pythagorean Theorem! 

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous and significant theorems in geometry, a fundamental concept in mathematics that has far-reaching implications in many areas. I'd be delighted to explain its significance.

What does it say?
----------------

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, at least one of which makes up the right angle:

a² + b² = c²"

In other words,ous, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs (sides) of a right triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

Why is it so important?

Explain the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem in geometry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Pythagorean Theorem! 

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous and significant theorems in geometry, a fundamental concept in mathematics that has far-reaching implications in many areas. I'd be delighted to explain its significance.

What does it say?
----------------

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, at least one of which makes up the right angle:

a² + b² = c²"

In other words,ous, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs (sides) of a right triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

Why is it so important?

1\. **Right Triangles**: The theorem only works for triangles with a right angle (90-degree angle).

Explain the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem in geometry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Pythagorean Theorem! 

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous and significant theorems in geometry, a fundamental concept in mathematics that has far-reaching implications in many areas. I'd be delighted to explain its significance.

What does it say?
----------------

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, at least one of which makes up the right angle:

a² + b² = c²"

In other words,ous, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs (sides) of a right triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

Why is it so important?

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous and significant theorems in geometry, a fundamental concept in mathematics that has far-reaching implications in many areas. I'd be delighted to explain its significance.

What does it say?
----------------

The theorem states:

"In a right-angled triangle, where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, at least one of which makes up the right angle:

a² + b² = c²"

In other words,ous, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs (sides) of a right triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.
