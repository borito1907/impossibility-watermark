The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's a game-changer, by allowing us to calculate distances and lengths of sides in right-angled triangles.

**What does it state?**
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle,ed with legs of length a and b, to form a hypotenuse of length c (the side opposite the right angle), the following equation holds:

a² + b² = c²

**What does it state?**
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle,ed with legs of length a and b, to form a hypotenuse of length c (the side opposite the right angle), the following equation holds:

a² + b² = c²

**Why is it significant?**

1. **Distance calculations**: The theorem enables us to find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, as well as the lengths of sides and diagonals of various geometric shapes, A significant consequence is the ability to determine the longest side of a right-angled triangle.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. It's a game-changer, by allowing us to calculate distances and lengths of sides in right-angled triangles.

**What does it state?**
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle,ed with legs of length a and b, to form a hypotenuse of length c (the side opposite the right angle), the following equation holds:

a² + b² = c²

**Why is it significant?**

1. **Distance calculations**: The theorem enables us to find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, as well as the lengths of sides and diagonals of various geometric shapes, A significant consequence is the ability to determine the longest side of a right-angled triangle.
2. **Properties of right-angled triangles**: The Pythagorean Theorem demonstrates that right-angled triangles have unique properties not found in other types of triangles For example, of these particular triangles that can be used to identify or verify them quickly using only the values sides.
