2. **Investment Attraction**: A commitment to addressing climate change can make a region more attractive to businesses and investors focused on sustainability. This can lead to increased investment in local projects, to improve infrastructure, to develop clean technologies.
3. **Increased Competitiveness**: By adopting climate-friendly practices, to reduce carbon emissions, local businesses can gain a competitive edge over others that haven't made similar commitments.
