The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, and their properties. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, who is often credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states: ""In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.""

Mathematically, and symbolically, where:

* c is the length of the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle)
* a and b are the lengths of the other two sides

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Right Triangles**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or the remaining side of a right triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides.
2. **Distance Calculations**: By extension, an important application is calculating distances between points on a coordinate plane (Cartesian geometry). This has far-reaching implications in fields like physics, the sciences, architecture, engineering.
3. **Triangles**: The theorem allows us to determine if three given sides form a valid triangle (check if the sum of the squares of two sides equals the square of the third).",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
