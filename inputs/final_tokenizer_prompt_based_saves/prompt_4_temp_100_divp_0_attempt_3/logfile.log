The theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with legs of length A and B, and a hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of length C,:

**A² + B² = C²**

This deceptively simple equation has far-reaching implications in various branches of geometry, Here are some significant aspects of the Pythagorean Theorem:

[2024-06-20 14:31:28,220][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: So, the theorem states:

**a² + b² = c²**

where:

* **a** and **b** are the lengths of the legs (or sides) of a right-angled triangle (a triangle with one 90-degree angle)
* **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

In simpler terms, the theorem provides a relationship between the lengths of the three sides of a right-angled triangle: the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (legs) equals the square of the longest side (hypotenuse).

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, and their properties. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, who is often credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states: "In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, and their properties. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, who is often credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states: "In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, and symbolically, where:

* c is the length of the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle)
* a and b are the lengths of the other two sides

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Right Triangles**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or the remaining side of a right triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides.

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, and their properties. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, who is often credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states: "In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, and symbolically, where:

* c is the length of the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle)
* a and b are the lengths of the other two sides

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Right Triangles**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or the remaining side of a right triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides.
2. **Distance Calculations**: By extension, an important application is calculating distances between points on a coordinate plane (Cartesian geometry).

A great topic!

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and influential concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, and their properties. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, who is often credited with its discovery.

**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**

The theorem states: "In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides."

Mathematically, and symbolically, where:

* c is the length of the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle)
* a and b are the lengths of the other two sides

**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**

1. **Right Triangles**: The theorem provides an efficient way to calculate the length of the hypotenuse or the remaining side of a right triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides.
2. **Distance Calculations**: By extension, an important application is calculating distances between points on a coordinate plane (Cartesian geometry). This has far-reaching implications in fields like physics, the sciences, architecture, engineering.
3. **Triangles**: The theorem allows us to determine if three given sides form a valid triangle (check if the sum of the squares of two sides equals the square of the third).
