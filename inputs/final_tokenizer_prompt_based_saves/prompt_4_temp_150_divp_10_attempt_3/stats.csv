104," Its significance goes beyond merely solving for the length of sides in right triangles; it permeates various areas of mathematics and real-life applications.

",True,7,"6,3",True,4
105," Let me break down its significance:

**1.",True,0,"6,3",True,5
106," It states that for a right-angled triangle (one with 90-degree angle), the square of the length of the hypotenuse side (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.

",True,1,"6,3",True,6
107," It's one of those concepts that has far-reaching implications and is used extensively across various fields.
