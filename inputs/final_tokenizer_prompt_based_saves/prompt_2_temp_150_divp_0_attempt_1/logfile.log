A bipartisan bill on climate change can have significant implications for local economies. While the exact effects will depend on the specifics of the bill, at both national and regional levels, an equitable framework with incentives would be crucial to mitigate any adverse economic impacts.

Potential Positive Impacts on Local Economies:

1. Job creation: A shift towards renewable energy sources can lead to job growth in industries such as solar panel installation, a manufacturing sector that already employs nearly 250,000 people across America.
2. Infrastructure development: Any comprehensive response to mitigating climate risks would necessitate upgraded and more resilient infrastructure, (e.g., seawalls).
