1. **Representing Constituents**: Senators represent the interests of their state's citizens in the Senate, (about 700,000 people per senator on average). They must listen to their constituents' concerns, Aand priorities and act accordingly.

2. **Legislation**: Senators introduce, debate, and vote on bills that can become federal laws. They work with other senators and members of the House of Representatives to shape legislation that benefits their state and the nation.

3. **Oversight and Advice**: The Senate has the responsibility of providing advice and consent on presidential nominations, including Supreme Court justices, federal judges, and high-ranking government officials.
