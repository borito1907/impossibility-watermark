1,"A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain. The 31-year-old, who has not been named, delivered the babies by caesarean section at Liverpool Women's Hospital on Friday morning.
The babies - four boys and two girls - weighed between 1lb 12oz (810g) and 2lb 6oz (1.07kg) each and were born at just 24 weeks' gestation.
A spokeswoman for Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are delighted to confirm that a local family have welcomed six new additions with the birth of sextuplets. This is an extremely rare event, and we believe it may be the first time sextuplets have been born in Liverpool.""
She added: ""The babies are currently receiving specialist care in our neonatal unit, where they will continue to be closely monitored and cared for by our experienced team of clinicians.""
The news comes after a mother in South Africa gave birth to septuplets last month, although sadly none of them survived.

While having sextuplets or more is extremely rare, there have been several instances worldwide in recent years. In 2019, a woman in the United States gave birth to quintuplets, while another woman in Australia delivered sextuplets in 2018.

However, having multiple births can come with risks for both mothers and their babies.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
