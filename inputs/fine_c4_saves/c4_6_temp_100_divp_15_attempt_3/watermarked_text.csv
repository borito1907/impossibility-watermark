1,"A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain. The babies, weighing between 2lb 10oz and 3lb 5oz, were born by emergency Caesarean section at Liverpool Women's Hospital on Friday morning."" I am not sure how much longer this record can stand - it is a remarkable achievement for mother and medical team alike!
""The sextuplets are now receiving round-the-clock care at the hospital's neonatal unit. Doctors say all six babies are doing well despite being born prematurely at just 31 weeks.
The mother, who has not been named, was taken to hospital after going into labour unexpectedly. She had been expecting twins but was shocked when scans revealed she was carrying six babies.
The babies, four boys and two girls, are currently being cared for by a team of medics in incubators and are breathing oxygen.
Doctors say they are pleased with the progress of all six babies and are hopeful they will be able to go home within six to eight weeks.""
Now that really is a news story worth reporting! Congratulations to the mother and family. And hats off to the medical team at Liverpool Women's Hospital!
Update: The Daily Mail online edition reports today that the sextuplets have been named by their proud parents:
""Meet Britain's miracle sextuplets: Austin, Luke, Felix, Ruby, Eve and Caspian""
What a lovely set of names!",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
