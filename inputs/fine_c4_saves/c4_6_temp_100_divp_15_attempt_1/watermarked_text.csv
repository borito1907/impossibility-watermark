1,"A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain. The babies, all boys, were born by Caesarean section at 31 weeks gestation on September 4 at Birmingham Women's Hospital.

The mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, was already a parent of two children when she conceived the sextuplets naturally, without any fertility treatment. She had been expecting twins but was surprised during her ultrasound scan to discover that there were six babies.

The babies are named: Jaxon, Jenson, Jovie, Jamon, Jourdan and Justin. They weighed between 3lb 10oz and 4lb 10oz at birth. While they required oxygen therapy immediately after birth, they are now doing well and breathing independently.

Dr Dave Edwards, consultant neonatologist at Birmingham Women's Hospital, said: ""This is an extraordinary and rare event, not only for our hospital but also for the UK. We have a team of dedicated staff who have worked tirelessly to care for these precious babies and ensure they receive the best possible start in life.""

Professor Derek Tuffnell, a specialist in maternal and fetal medicine at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), commented: ""Sextuplets are extremely rare, with odds of around one in 13 million.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
