1,"Panicked investors who participated in the mammoth stock sell-off should get back into the market immediately because a lengthy hiatus often results in missing out on gains. In addition, this group must take cognizance of their risk tolerance and rebalance their portfolios as required.
**The ""I'm still wary"" category**: Investors who have been cautious and have largely avoided the stock market or have minimal exposure to equities must assess their financial goals and risk appetite. This group should consider taking small steps towards increasing their equity allocation, but only after thorough research and understanding of the market conditions.

They should start with a careful analysis of their financial objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It is essential for them to begin with a well-diversified portfolio, investing a fixed proportion of their income at regular intervals.
