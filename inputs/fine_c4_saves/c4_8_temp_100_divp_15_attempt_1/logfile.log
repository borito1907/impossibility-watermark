[2024-06-17 20:29:41,758][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: Mark Macias is a former Executive Producer with NBC, Senior Producer with CBS in New York and author of the book, Beat the Press: Your Guide to Managing the Media. He currently writes for several news sites including The Daily Caller and Big League Politics.
I have long been suspicious of the relationship between certain media outlets and their sources. Mark’s book provides valuable insight into how the press operates and often fails the public it serves. I highly recommend “Beat the Press” for anyone who wants to understand the machinations behind the headlines.
Thank you, Mark, for joining me on this episode of American Reveille.
