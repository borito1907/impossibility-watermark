I have long been suspicious of the relationship between certain media outlets and their sources. Mark’s book provides valuable insight into how the press operates and often fails the public it serves. I highly recommend “Beat the Press” for anyone who wants to understand the machinations behind the headlines.
Thank you, Mark, for joining me on this episode of American Reveille.
