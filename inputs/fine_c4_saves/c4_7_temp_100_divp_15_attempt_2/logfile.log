[2024-06-17 20:41:57,785][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: Randy and Jenny Boyd are providing a $5.5 million gift for the next phase of renovations at UT's Tom Black Track.
Randy and Jenny Boyd of Knoxville have provided a $5.5 million gift to spearhead Phase Two of renovations at the University of Tennessee's Tom Black Track at LaPorte Stadium.
Tom Black Track serves the university's track and field program. Phase One included a resurfacing and redesign of the layout.
Phase Two is highlighted by the Boyd Family Track and Field Center in the northwest corner. The center will include a satellite training room, a team meeting room, storage space, a pavilion and concession stand.
The Boyds are alumni, Class of 1979. Randy Boyd is the founder of Radio Systems Corp. and owns the Tennessee Smokies baseball team, the Class AA affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.
He is also the commissioner of the state Department of Economic and Community Development. The Boyds have previously been lead donors for UT. The Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research in the Haslam College of Business is named in their honor.
