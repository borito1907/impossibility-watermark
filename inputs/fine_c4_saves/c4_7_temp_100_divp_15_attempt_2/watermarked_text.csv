The Boyds' gift is one of the largest in the school's history, a university statement said.
""Jenny and I believe in the power of storytelling and the importance of high-quality journalism,"" Randy Boyd said in the statement. ""We want to help ensure that future generations of journalists have the best possible education and training.""
The new building will be named the Randall and Jenny Boyd Building in recognition of their gift. It will provide state-of-the-art facilities for students, faculty and staff, including classrooms, studios, labs and collaborative workspaces.
""We're thrilled about this transformative gift from Randy and Jenny Boyd,"" said UO President Michael Schill. ""Their generosity will enable us to create an extraordinary learning environment that will prepare our students for success in the rapidly changing media landscape.""
Groundbreaking on the new building is expected in spring 2023, with completion anticipated in fall 2024.
