* Classes with mixed responsibilities (not single responsibility principle)

Instead, consider using other design techniques, such as:

* Composition: Have a class that holds references to objects that implement specific behaviors (e.g., `Renderer` has-a `Blitter`, has-a `Spinner`)
* Interfaces or Mixins: Define interfaces or mixins for each behavior (`IBlitting`, `ISpinning`) and have the main class implement/compose these

By avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies and focusing on simpler, more modular designs, you'll write cleaner, more maintainable code!
