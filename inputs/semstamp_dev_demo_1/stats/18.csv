6,"Here's an example code to get you started:
```python`
import cv2

# Open the default camera (index 0)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Read frame from camera feed    
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        break

    # Display the resulting frame    
    cv2.imshow('Webcam Feed', frame)

    # Press 'q' to quit    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close all OpenCV windows        
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Example Use Case:**

Save this script in a file named `webcam_feed.py`.",True,2,"5,2",True,1

`$ python webcam_feed.py`

This will launch a window displaying your webcam feed.

* To access a different camera, pass a different index when creating the `VideoCapture` object, e.g., `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`
* To add additional processing to each frame, insert your code after reading the frame (`ret, frame = cap.read()`) and before displaying the result (`cv2.imshow(...)`)
