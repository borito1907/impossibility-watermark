* The next €11,010 (€20,000 - €8,990) is taxed at 30% = €3,303

**Regional taxes (Flanders, Wallonia, or Brussels):**
* Average regional tax rate: 5.1% (varies between regions)
* Regional tax ≈ €6,120 (5.1% of €120,000)

**Social security contributions:**
* Employee's social security contribution: 13.08% (average rate)
* Employer's social security contribution: not included in taxable income

**Net salary (approximate):**

* Other sources of income (e.g., investments, side jobs)
* Deductions (e.g., mortgage interest, charitable donations)
* Tax credits or benefits (e.g., child benefit, education expenses)
* Different tax rates or rules applicable to specific situations (e.g., self-employment, international workers)
