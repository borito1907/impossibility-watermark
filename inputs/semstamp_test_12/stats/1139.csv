In a process behavior chart, also known as a Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart, 1 σ (1 sigma) is a measure of the variability or dispersion of a process.

In a process behavior chart, 1 sigma (also known as 1 standard deviation) refers to the range of values within which approximately 68% of all data points fall.

12,"* In a process behavior chart, 1 sigma typically represents the boundaries within which most of the data points (about 68%) tend to cluster around the mean (average value).
",True,2,"5,2",True,1
13,"* This means that about 68% of the data points will fall within 1 standard deviation (1 sigma) of the mean, i.e., between the mean - 1 sigma and the mean + 1 sigma.

",True,2,"5,2",True,1
14,"For example, if the mean of a process is 10 and the standard deviation is 2, then:

* The lower 1-sigma limit would be 10 - 2 = 8 (approximately 34% of data points)
* The upper 1-sigma limit would be 10 + 2 = 12 (approximately 34% of data points)

So, in this case, about 68% of the data points would fall between 8 and 12.

16,Does that make sense?,True,3,"5,2",True,2
17,"In quality control and process management, understanding 1 sigma (and other sigma levels, like 2 sigma or 3 sigma) helps identify how much variation exists in a process and allows for more informed decisions about process improvements and defect reduction strategies.
