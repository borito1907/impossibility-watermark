**Brand A:**

* Total ratings: 9 (5 for Code 15C and 4 for Code BMX)
* Average overall rating: approximately 4.78 stars (calculated by summing all ratings and dividing by the total number of ratings)
* Most popular code: 15C (with 5 ratings)

**Brand C:**

* Total ratings: 5 (one rating per code)
* Average overall rating: 5 stars (all ratings are 5-star)
* No single most popular code stands out, as each code only has one rating
