* 1 narrow-beam light source (e.g., a sidelight, strip box, or a focused LED panel)
* Positioned behind the car, aimed at the edges and contours to create definition and separation from the background (experiment with different angles and positions)
* Power output around 50-100Ws or equivalent LED power (similar to the fill light)

* Optional, but can add depth and interest to the image:

43,"

For a low-key studio car shoot, in terms of lighting, to achieve moody and dramatic results, (high contrast), here's a basic setup:

**Key Light:**

* Position: Sidelight or 3/4 backlight (about 90-120 degrees off-axis from the camera)
* Type: Hard light source (e.g., a fresnel or a small softbox with a grid)
* Intensity: Medium to high intensity (depending on the desired level of contrast)
* Color Temperature: Cool tone (around 5600K) to enhance the car's metal and give it a sleek look

**Fill Light:**

* Position: Opposite the key light (about 180-210 degrees off-axis from the camera)
* Type: Soft light source (e.g., a large softbox or a diffusion panel)
* Intensity: Low to medium intensity (just enough to lift the shadows without flattening the image)
* Color Temperature: Same as the key light or slightly warmer (around 5300K)

**Backlight/Rim Light:**

* Position: Behind the car, around 10-20 degrees above the horizon line (separating the car from the background)
* Type: Hard light source (e.g., a fresnel or a sidelight with a flag)
* Intensity: High intensity (to create a strong rim of light around the car's edges)
* Color Temperature: Similar to the key light (around 5600K)

**Background Lighting:**

* Type: Subdued, dark, or neutral-colored background to let the car be the main focus)
* Lighting: Minimal to no lighting on the background (or a subtle gradient effect to enhance the mood)

**Additional Tips:**

* Use flags or gobos to control light spill and prevent unwanted highlights on the car's surfaces.
