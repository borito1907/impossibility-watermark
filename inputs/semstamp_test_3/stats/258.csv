Or if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use the `format_args!` macro to specify the argument names directly in the format string:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,5,"1,4",False,1
238,"."", name, age);
```

Or if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use named arguments:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,5,"1,4",False,2
239,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,3
240,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,4
241,"."", name, age);
```

Or, if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use named arguments like this:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,5,"1,4",False,5
242,"."", name, age);
```

Or if you want to specify the argument positions or names explicitly, you can use the `{:}` syntax like so:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,1,"1,4",False,6

```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,53

Or if you want to specify the argument position in the format string, you can use the `{position}` syntax:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,1,"1,4",False,54
291,"."", name, age);
```

Or if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use named arguments for more readability:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,5,"1,4",False,55
292,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,56
293,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,57
294,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,58
295,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,59
296,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,60
297,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,61
298,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: ""Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,62
299,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,63
300,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,64
301,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,65
302,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,66
303,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,67
304,"."", name, age);
```

Or, if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use named arguments like this:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,5,"1,4",False,68
305,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,69
306,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,70
307,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,71
308,"."", name, age);
```

Or if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use the `fmt` argument syntax:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,5,"1,4",False,72
309,"."", name, age);
```

Or if you want to specify the argument names (like `name` and `age`) directly in the format string, you can use named arguments like so:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,1,"1,4",False,73
310,"."", name, age);
```

This will output: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,74
311,"."", name, age);
```

This will print: `Hello, John!",True,5,"1,4",False,75
312," You are 30 years old.` 

Alternatively, if you're using Rust 1.58 or later, you can use named arguments for better readability:

```rust 
let name = ""John"";
let age = 30;
println",True,1,"1,4",True,1
313,"!(""Hello, {name}!",True,4,"6,2",False,1
