Now, let's calculate the usable capacity in a RAID 5 configuration:

Usable capacity = 42TB / (number of drives - 1) = 42TB / (4 - 1) = 42TB / 3 ≈ 14TB per drive

Since there are four drives, the total usable capacity would be:

Total usable capacity = 4 x 14TB ≈ 56TB

However, since we're using 10TB as our baseline, the actual usable capacity will be slightly lower due to the remaining capacity on the larger drives being unused.
