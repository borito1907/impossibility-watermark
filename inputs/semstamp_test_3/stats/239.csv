Here is a simple function in C++ to calculate the area of a cube:

```cpp

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

double calculateArea(double side) {
    // The formula for surface area of a cube is 6 * (side ^ 2)
    return 6 * (side * side);
}

int main() {

    cout << ""Enter the side length of the cube: "";
    cin >> side;

    double area = calculateArea(side);

    cout << ""The area of the cube is: "" << area << endl;

    return 0;

Here is a simple function in C++ that calculates the surface area and volume of a cube:
```

}
```
In this code, we define two functions `cubeSurfaceArea` and `cubeVolume` which take the length of the side of the cube as an argument and return the calculated surface area and volume respectively.
