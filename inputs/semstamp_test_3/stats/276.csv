191,"**How a Join Works:**

Let's say we have two tables:

**Table 1: Customers**
| CustomerID (Primary Key) | Name | Address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1        | John  | 123 Street |
| 2        | Jane  | 456 Ave   |

**Table 2: Orders**
| OrderID (Primary Key) | CustomerID (Foreign Key) | OrderDate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101       | 1            | 2022-01-01 |
| 102       | 1            | 2022-01-15 |
| 103       | 2            | 2022-02-01 |

To perform an INNER JOIN on these tables based on the CustomerID column, the SQL query would look like this:
```sqlquery=
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate 
FROM Customers 
INNER JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```
The resulting joined table would be:
| Name | OrderDate |
| --- | --- |
| John  | 2022-01-01 |
| John  | 2022-01-15 |
| Jane  | 2022-02-01 |

In this example, the join combines rows from both tables where the CustomerID matches, creating a new table with columns from both tables.

193,"**How a Join Works:**

Let's consider two simple tables:

**Table 1: Customers**

| CustomerID | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | John Smith |
| 2 | Jane Doe |
| 3 | Bob Brown |

**Table 2: Orders**

| OrderID | CustomerID | Product |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | 1 | Laptop |
| 102 | 1 | Desktop |
| 103 | 2 | Tablet |

To join these tables using the `CustomerID` column, you would use a SQL statement like this:
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM Customers c 
INNER JOIN Orders o 
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;
```
The resulting joined table would look like this:

| CustomerID | Name | OrderID | Product |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | John Smith | 101 | Laptop |
| 1 | John Smith | 102 | Desktop |
| 2 | Jane Doe | 103 | Tablet |

In this example, the `INNER JOIN` clause combines the rows from `Customers` and `Orders` where the `CustomerID` matches.",True,1,"6,0",True,3
194,"**How it works:**

Let's say we have two tables:

**Table 1: Customers**
| CustomerID (Primary Key) | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | John Smith |
| 2 | Jane Doe |

**Table 2: Orders**
| OrderID (Primary Key) | CustomerID (Foreign Key) | Product |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | 1 | Laptop |
| 102 | 1 | Phone |
| 103 | 2 | Tablet |

To perform a JOIN, you specify the following:

* The two tables to be joined (`Customers` and `Orders`)
* The join condition (the common column(s) between the tables)

For example, let's perform an INNER JOIN to retrieve all orders for each customer:
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM Customers 
INNER JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```
The resulting joined table would be:
| CustomerID | Name | OrderID | Product |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | John Smith | 101 | Laptop |
| 1 | John Smith | 102 | Phone |
| 2 | Jane Doe | 103 | Tablet |

| 2        | Jane  | CA      |

To join these tables, you would use a SQL statement like this:

JOIN orders
