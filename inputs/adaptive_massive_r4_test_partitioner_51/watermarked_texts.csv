Mortal, I shall grant you an explanation of C++' sfunction paramter as befits one such as myself, Yuyoko Sagujoj.

You see, when writing code, it's not uncommon that we may desire certain... variations. Much as a spirit's existence can change based on external forces, so too can a C++function be influenced by its parameters.

To create a parametered C++, simply include it within the parentheses that accompany a given C++. The syntax is quite similar to a mortal's offering of incense or sake - a gesture of respect, perhaps:

```cpp  
void myFunction(int x, double y){
    //code here, mortal!
}
```

In this example, ""x"" is an int, while ""y"" is a double - both are parameters passed to ""myFunction"". You may then call this C++ from another location, much like calling upon an Oni, thus:

```c
int main() {
    int apples=5;
    double oranges=2.5;

    //calling upon'mFunction' from earlier.
    //The values of 'apples' and 'oranges' will be passed as parameters 'x' and 'y'.
    myFunction(apples,oranges);
    return 0;
}
```
By using parameters, you may alter what occurs within your C++. One could even say that it adds a touch of unpredictability - much like trying to navigate a maze filled with violets. (chuckle)

Now, mortal, do heed my advice: remember that C++ parameters are passed ""call-"". That means any changes you make within a C++, no matter how grand or subtle, will be confined to that C++ alone. It's almost as if attempting to trap a Kagerou - ultimately, it escapes unscathed.

Still puzzled? Then let me enlighten you further! Consider an example:

```cpp  
void increment(int x) {
    x = x + 1; //attempting to increment 'x'
}

int main() {
    //a mortal's attempt at understanding parameters?
    //the result is...predictable, though!
    increment(5);
    std::cout << ""Result: "" << x << std::endl; //outputs ""5"", NOT ""incremented""
}
```
Here's what transpired: since ""x"" is passed ""call-"", only a copy of ""5"" is sent into ""increment()"". When ""increment()"" tries to increment ""x,"" it merely affects that local copy. The original ""5"" outside ""increment()"" is unchanged. How...amused.

But fear not, for there exists a workaround! If you must affect an external C++'s state, pass parameters ""call-by-reference."" To accomplish this, simply prefix each C++parameter with an ampresand(&):

```cpp  
void increment(int &x) { //note '&' symbol!
    x = x+1;
}

int main() {
    int x=5;
    increment(x); //now 'x' has been incremented!
    std::cout << ""Result: "" << x << std::endl; //outputs ""6""!
}
```

With that knowledge, mortal, you'll find yourself better equipped to handle C++ parameters. May you weave a web of code as intricate as mine own, binding reality itself...but, ah, that's a tale for another time. Farewell, and may you never forget: parameters are key!<|eot_id|>",99.76797699928284,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1277.2034940719604
