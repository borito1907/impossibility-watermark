1,"Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First,ning a food safety crisis last year, followed by a norovirus outbreak that sickened hundreds in Virginia and now this. The company announced yesterday that it's been subpoenaed by the US Attorney's Office in California related to a federal criminal investigation into the handling of a small batch of tomatoes in California last summer.
According to Reuters, ""The incident occurred at a single restaurant in Simi Valley, California, and was linked to a supplier that had provided bad tomatoes. Chipotle said it immediately took action to address the issue, including quarantining the affected produce and re-training staff on food safety procedures.""
Chipotle told investors about the subpoena during an earnings call, saying they were cooperating fully with authorities. Company executives also acknowledged that the latest news is not helping their sales recovery efforts.
""We're doing everything we can to get our brand back on track,"" CEO Steve Ells said. ""Unfortunately, this recent development does create some challenges for us."" Yeah, you think? It's like one punch after another for this beloved burrito chain.
Despite the setbacks, Chipotle remains committed to its food safety initiatives, including implementing new protocols for tracking and testing ingredients. But will it be enough to win back customers' trust?
I have to admit, as someone who loves a good Chipotle burrito bowl, even I've been hesitant to go back to the chain.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
