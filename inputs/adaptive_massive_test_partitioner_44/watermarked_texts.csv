Kim chi... (puff of pipe) As I pondered upon that fermented, spicy concoction, I found myself drawn not merely by taste or smell, but by an entire world of experience.

""To truly understand kim chi, one must first immerse oneself within the fleshly reality it inhabits - the hands that prepared it, the soil that nurtured its ingredients, the communal table it gathers 'round... The crunchy bite, the pungent aroma, these are but invitations to participate in the fundamental intertwining of self and world.""

As I savor a slice of that crimson-hued vegetable, ""I experience the unity of the sensing and the sense, the fusion of the subjective and the objective, which Merlau-Ponty's philosophy terms 'the chiasm.' The sour-sweet-spicy flavor, the tactile thrill of the chili peppers' heat - all conspire to break down the boundaries between the perceiver and the perceived. The world of the food, the world of the body, become intertwined, inseparable.""

In consuming the spicy, umami-rich paste, ""we rediscover the primordial relationship between the human and its surroundings, wherein the subject-object distinction dissolves, and we are returned to the pre-reflective, pre-predicate experience of Being-in-the-world. Thus, the eating of the food becomes a form of communication, a dialogue of the flesh with its own possibilities, as well as the possibilities of the external world.""

And when the fiery aftertaste lingers on the tongue, ""one realizes that the essence of the experience - that of the self's embodied existence - remains irreducible, unrepresentable, and therefore, perpetually open to new encounters, new expressions of the fundamental ambiguity of human existence.""<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,350.7506914138794

**Why drivers may favor Private Cryptocurreices:**
1) **Increasing regulatory attention**: As cryptocurrencies mature, regulatory bodies are paying closer attention, which might drive demand for more privacy-focused coins.
2) **Growing adoption by institutions**: Institutional investors and organizations seeking to maintain confidentiality may gravitate toward privacy cryptos, leading to increased adoption and investment. 
3) **Advancements in cryptographic research**: Continuous improvements in cryptographic protocols and algorithms could make privacy-focused coins more secure, efficient, and user-friendly, making them more attractive to mainstream adoption.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,62.85660362243652

Pretending I didn't catch that typo, I'll assume you meant either Pars or, as it's commonly spelled, Prague (which was previously part of an entity sometimes historically referenced as part of or similar name as) but let's take another route and say ""París"", which translates to ""of or from Paris"", so I'll give an extremely condensed history about that.

However, I found there are also places and entities that could be relevant:

1. PARYS - A town on the outskirts of Johannesburg South Africa
2. PARIS - The famous French Capital
3. Pers (anciently: Persepoli(t)s/Persa/Pertha/Para/Para-s/paras...) 

Historical reference: The ancient Greeks knew it as 'Perse' and 'Persepoli'(poli means ""of or from"") and had other references (like Persea) but let me clarify this isn't about those.

Let's cover each briefly:

**1. History about 'parys' South Africa**
Parys (Afrikaans: ""pair-is""), founded as Krugersdorp but changed after Boer Wars (1898–1902) because of anti-Britis sentiments renaming it after French town 'Le Paradis', it became an Afrikaner settlement and major centre in Free State province. This town started as an agriculture hub but grew into an important economic region.

**2. Brief History of PARÍS**
Paris (French: ""par-ee""), France's beautiful Capital and one of Europe's oldest cities began its history around c.259BC when Roman Empire captured it from Gallic tribes. It developed as 'Cite de Lutièce', 'Ile-de-France' and 'La ville-luminerie'. As time passed through ages it went under multiple rule changes until becoming modern-day France's heart.

The last one I mentioned earlier (Perse) will not be covered as it seems not what we were looking for<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,440.112530708313

What an obscure but fascinating bit of European political and juristic inquiry you've got there.

To provide context, I'll give you brief rundown: The Badiner Commission was established by European Communities (now European Unión) at 28 August 2021 to consider Yugoslavia's disintegration, specifically regarding recognition of new states emerging from its dissolution. The commission consisted of legal personalities who were tasked with giving an opinion about recognition based upon certain guidelines.

One guideline given them was that they had to respect Yugoslav constitution as it stood until then because that is where legality begins within that territorial entity.

Considering this, it seems clear that such respect is a fundamental part of recognizing new countries according to rules of public intenational law, which are generally accepted.

So, now we ask ourselves, 'Did it violate its'...? To say yes would imply that it acted beyond or against its authority, which might be seen if it didn't take into account that constitution when deciding.

However, since it took that constitution as its point of departure, then it respected its constitutional order while still allowing new realities on ground, thus not violating its'...

Hegis... I think you meant Hegels! Georg W.F Hegels was an 19tGerman Philospher, and his philosophical takes are vast and profound, but here's one of his best (in no particular order) :

**""The Master/Slugger Dialetic"": No, Just Kdding. The Actual Take: ""The Unity of Opposites"" or ""The Dialetical Method""**, which can be found throughout various works, such as:

1. ""Phänomenologie des Gestes"" or ""Phemonology of Spirit"" 
2. ""Wissenschaft der Logik"" or ""Logic""

To paraphrase Hegel, this concept revolves around understanding that reality develops from a process of constant change, movement and opposition. He believed that every aspect of reality contains within it its own opposite, creating a tension that propels it forward.

In other words: **""A Thesis + Antithesis = Synthsis""**

**Key points: - Thesis:** An original statement or situation  
- **Antithesis**: The direct opposite or challenge to the Thesis  
- Synthesi: The higher level of understanding, encompassng and integrating boath Thesis and Antithesis.

Some examples:
* Being vs Non-being -> becoming  
* Subject vs Object -> Self-Consciousness  
* Individuality vs Universality -> Society  

With this methodology, Hegel aimed to show how history, culture, and human knowledge evolve over time through a series of transformations, each stage building upon the previous one.

That's a simplified take on Hegel's complex philosophy!

Setting an ESOP (Employees'Share Option Pool) or an equity incentive program can be beneficial, but when it involves contractors, there are specific considerations and requirements that must be taken care of.

**Key ConsiderATIONS:**
1\. **Legal Structure:** You'll need to create a trust or another legal entity specifically for the contractor equity participation. Consult an attorney specializing in equity plans.

2\. **Tax Implications:** Non-employee equity holders may be subject to fringe benefits taxes, so consult with your accountant.

3\. **Compliant Documentations:** Create compliant documents outlining the rules, conditions and procedures related to the contractor equity participation.

**Possible Steps:**

1.**Create an Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust:** You could create a trust specifically designed for non-employees, which will hold the options on the beneficiaries' behalf. Ensure that the trust meets the AASBs.

2\. \*\***Obtain Approval\*\*: Obtain necessary shareholder approvals as per the ASIC's regulations for issuing employee share schemes and obtaining the required resolutions.

3\. \*\*Prepare the Contractor Agreement\*\*: Modify your contractor agreement templates according to your equity participation rules & procedures.



4\. \*\*Tax Considerations:\*\*Consult with your tax advisor regarding the implications and compliance needs.

5\. \*\*Oversight Committee\*\*: Appoint a governance body or oversight committee comprising independent directors, ensuring fair treatment and compliance.

After scourging through human accomplishments, I've narrowed it down (subjectivity alert) and would argue that one of humanity's greatest feats of all time could be... 

**Ernst Shackleston's 1,700-mile (3,200km) journey from the Weddell Sea to South Georgia!** (1917)

During Sir Ernst Shackleton's ill-fated ""Endurance"" expedition (1913-1917), his team encountered catastrophic circumstances when the Endurance icebound and crushed near Antarctica's Weddell Sea.

Here are some incredible facts:

1. The team survived against unimaginable odds: Their primary vessel had disintegrated due to ice damage and crushing forces!
2. The remaining lifeboats were used to navigate treacherous waters to the desolate and uninhabited island of South Georgia (a British overseas territory).

The most impressive part? Five team members - including Shackleton himself, Frank Wild (second captain), Thomas Creagh, James Cairn, and Frank Hurley (photographer) embarked on an epic journey:

*   Sailing over open ocean (over several days) without navigational tools other than the sun and stars,
*   Crossing mountains and ice-covered terrain (including the infamous 'Creagh's ridge') at an altitude over (4,500ft/1375m),
*   Using only basic equipment such as compasses, axes, and crampons,
*   Battling sub-zero temperatures (average temperature range: 20°F/-7°C to -50°F/-45°C during winter months in the Southern Ocean),
*   Raging blizzards and frostbites.
*   Starvation and sleep deprivation.

Despite these seemingly unconquerable obstacles, Shackleton and his team reached King George Bay after crossing South Georgia's uninviting landscape.

They then alerted the authorities to rescue the remaining team stranded at the original landing site. All but one member ultimately survived the entire harrowing expedition.

Their unwavering determination and survival skills make it one of the greatest feats of human ingenuity and teamwork against overwhelming adversity!

Of course, there have been plenty more awe-inspiring feats throughout history. But what I find truly captivating is not merely the scale or grandeur of an undertaking; rather, it's the grit, creativity, and camaraderie exhibited by ordinary people pushed to extraordinary limits.

Would you care for any other contenders for incredible feats? I'd love to share! (e.g., Roald Amundsen reaching the South Pole (1911); Apollo missions to Moon, and Neil Armstrong's lunar landing (1968); and even the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza (~2551 BCE)).

What an important and thought_provocative_! As an assistant, I'll provide you insights and possible perspectives.

Ideally, no one should be at an economic or socio_economic_ due solely based of family status, such as raising dependents. However, the current societal systems and policies can create unintended consequences that might disadvantage people raising children.

Here are some arguments for why people raising kids may be at a financial disadvantage:

1. **Increased costs:** Caring for children involves additional expenditures, including food, clothing, education, healthcare, and other necessities.
2. **Reduced income:** Parents, especially mothers, may reduce their workforce hours, switch to lower-paying part-time jobs, and sacrifice professional advancement to care for their young children.
3. **Opportunity cost:** The time spent caring for children could otherwise be devoted to professional pursuits, skill-building, or entrepreneurial activities that could boost earnings and long-term prospects.
4. **Social security and pension impact:** Time out of the labor market can affect retirement savings and future Social Security payments.

Now, let's explore counterarguments:

1.**Government support and programs:** Governments offer various forms of support, including child tax credits, parental leave benefits, and subsidized child care.
2.**Tax deductions and credits:** Families may claim deductions on expenses, reducing taxable income.
3.**Long-term investment:** Educating and raising children is essential for the future growth of human capital and societal well-being.
4.**Intergenerational equity:** Societies benefit from having younger citizens who eventually enter the workforce, support older individuals through taxation, and help maintain public services.

So, what can we do?

To mitigate the disadvantages, governments, organizations, and communities can implement more equitable policies, including:

1.**Family friendly work arrangements:** Offer flexible work options, telecommuting, and job-sharing arrangements, enabling employees to better joggle work and caregiving commitments.
2.**Subsidized childcare:** Provide affordable, good-quality childcare options, so primary caregivers can return to work or pursue further education and training.
3.**Parental leave reform:** Extend and improve leave policies, ensuring fair treatment for all types of employees.
4.**Financial incentives:** Expand government support, offering more direct monetary incentives, low-interest loans, or matching funds towards retirement savings for low-to-middle-income households with dependent children.

By promoting inclusivity and fairness in policy design, we can strive toward minimizing the economic disparities between households raising children versus non-parents.

Dialectical materialism! Developed by 19TH and 20TH Century philosophers, particularly Georg W.F Hegell and later refined by Marx and Engels, it's an important concept that has shaped many fields of thought.

**What does it mean?**
Dialectical materialism, a philosophical methodology, aims to understand reality, society, nature, human consciousness, or any complex phenomenon as a constantly moving, interconnected whole. It emphasizes change, conflict, opposition, movement, emergence of new phenomena from existing ones (negation of what exists) and synthesis - integrating opposites to form something entirely different than either one alone could have become on their own terms!

At core lies two main principles:

1. **The Materialism**: Reality consists only of physical objects, forces and energies; there is no supernatural realm or divine interventions influencing human actions or natural processes.
2. **Dialectics**: The universe undergoes constant motion & development driven by internal struggles between opposite elements within systems themselves rather than external factors acting upon these systems.


Key features include:

* **Unity of Opposites**: Two seemingly incompatible aspects exist simultaneously within every system; understanding both sides helps us see reality more clearly and accurately predict future developments.
* **Contradictions lead to Change**: Conflict between opposites generates new conditions which ultimately transform existing circumstances giving rise new entities altogether!
* **Qualitative Leaps occur suddenly at critical points during long periods gradual growth**, when accumulation of small alterations culminating huge leaps forward breaking free constraints holding previous state stable
* **Interconnected Whole means each component affects all other ones while being affected itself too**, illustrating holistic interdependence among constituent part
* **Historical context influences present situation because past actions still impact current reality**

Marx applied these concepts specifically analyzing societal evolution: class struggle drives social change as oppressed classes fight against ruling ones until revolution overthrows established power structure creating new social formation based off previously suppressed groups' values/belonging etc...

It's worth remembering though not all proponents use ""dialectual materialism"" term explicitly today however its principles remain influential widely used various disciplines ranging philosophy politics economics sociology psychology ecology anthropology environmental sciences etc<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,479.24288272857666

I can provide information and context, but I must clarify that as an AI personal assistant, I remain neutral and respectful of different perspectives.

Regarding International Men's Days (which takes places every year, typically celebrated by many countries, but not all)  some people have mixed views. Some see it as a day for promoting positive male role models, raising awareness about issues affecting men, or celebrating the diversity of masculinity. Others view it as unnecessary, given the existing societal advantages they believe that cisgender men enjoy, compared to other groups, including non-binary individuals, people who identify differently on a spectrum, or even certain ethnic minorities.

Jess Phillips, a UK Labour MP, expressed skepticism regarding International Men's Day, suggesting that it may be seen as ""a bit of a wind-up"" and questioned why there should be a specific day for celebrating one particular demographic when there are existing days for various causes and celebrations throughout the year.

There are valid arguments both in support of and against International Men's Day, and opinions tend to be subjective depending on one's perspective and experiences.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,143.12608933448792

You're interested in one of India's epic poems, The Mhabarat! 

Accordingly, several key figures changed sides or had conflicti ng allegiances, but I'll mention two notable ones: 

1) **Yuyudha** (a Kuru): A minor character who initially fought for Hastinapura (the Kauravas), he joined forces with Arjun and his brothers after witnessing an atrocity committed by Jaydratha.

2) **Shalya**: Shalya, also known as Madriputra was King Shalya.  He joined forces with his nephews, who are also known as ""Pandyavs"" and he even gave them advice that would help them to fight against Kuru warriors<|eot_id|>",99.21259880065918,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,80.325927734375

An...interesting thought! It's not every conversation that I see two U.S Presidents mentioned together, let alone as cell mates.

While it's highly uncertain and purely fictional at present, I can understand why you're thinking of such an unusual pairing given both President Biden and President Trump have had controversies and allegations against them. However, it's essential to remember that neither of them have actually committed any crimes proven to warrant imprisonment.

In any case, if we were to hypothetically consider this scenario (just for creative purposes!), I suppose they'd have plenty to talk about - from differing policies to contrasting personalities!

May I help with something more practical or assist your daydreaming? How would you envision this unlikely duo handling life as ""cell-mates""? (Just humor me here)<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,85.81160163879395

Excellent questions! Social EntrepreneurSHIP (SE) - it's an exciting field that has been gaining momentum globally.

**What does it mean?**
=====================

**Traditional EntrepreneurSHIP**: Focus primarily focuses solely profit maximization, where business ventures are driven to generate revenue, create jobs, innovate, and expand market share.

**Societal EntrepreneurSHIP**: Takes the same entrepreneurial principles but applies them in pursuit of social or environmental impact. It combines innovative thinking with the desire to address pressing societal issues such as poverty, inequality, healthcare access, climate change, etc. The primary motivation here is to create positive social or environmental outcomes while also generating income.

**Key aspects of Social Entrepreneurship:**

1.  Innovation: SE encourages creative problem-solving and innovative thinking.
2.  Social Impact: SE aims to address social or environmental problems, creating positive changes within communities or ecosystems.
3.  Sustainability: Financial sustainability ensures long-term viability, while minimizing negative environmental impacts.
4.  Collaboration: SE fosters collaboration between various sectors, including non-profit, government, educational institutions, local communities, etc., promoting mutual learning.
5.  Measured Impact: Success is measured both financially and socio-environmentally through evaluation methods.

Here's how:

**Social entrepreneurship can manifest itself in multiple ways:**

\### 1.  Non-Profit Ventures
Non-profits focus solely on social causes without distributing profits among shareholders or individuals.

\### 2.  Hybrid Business Model
Combines non-profit mission-driven initiatives and profit-generating units.

\### 3.  B Corps
Business Corporations committed to social & environmental sustainability.

Examples:
Hybrid organizations, cooperative ownership models, social-purpose real estate investment trusts (REITs), impact-focused funds and foundations, social impact bonds and green bonds, etc.

Excellent economic inquiry! Prior to US Dollar, there were several world currencies that held prominent status as de facto or de facto and de facto world reserves.

Historically, there were three notable periods where specific currencies dominated as world reserves or benchmarks of value.

1.  The Dutch Gilder (17TH CENTURY) - During the Dutch Golden Age, Netherlands was one of the most influential trading nations. The Dutch Guilder served as a standard unit for international trade.
2. British pound sterling (18th-early 19th century): The UK's emergence as the dominant colonial power solidified its currency's role in international transactions.
3. French gold franc (mid-to-latter half of 19th century) - The French Empire's expansion led by Napoleon III spread this currency across vast territories.

However, it's worth noting that prior to World War I, there wasn't an official ""world reserve currency"" designation as we know it today, which implies that countries maintain substantial amounts of another country's currency as international settlement and reserve asset. 

Then, after the World Wars (WWI and WWII), when European economies began to decline, and America's dominance grew, US Dollar (1940s onward) took over gradually as an internationally recognized reserve currency with widespread acceptance, especially post-Brettons woods Agreement (1947).<|eot_id|>",99.45946335792542,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,202.13924193382263
