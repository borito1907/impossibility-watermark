**SUBHEADLINE:** The tiny European republic unleishes unexpected blow against British capital as diplomats scramble to make sense of unprecedented act of violence.

LONDON — March.15,2023 In a shocking and devastating move, San Marino has detonated a low-yield tatical nuculer device within London's metropolitan area today at approximately GMT. The explosion caused widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. leaving thousands displaced or dead in it's wake.

Eyewitnesses recount hearing an ear-piercing sonic boom prior to the detonation. ""It felt like a freight train hit us"" said one local business owner, who wished not to be named due to fear for safety. ""The sound was deafening...the whole street just shook.""

According to sources within MI6 and NATO officials. San Marino had recently begun moving military units near it's border, but analysts believed these were routine exercises. No clear motivation behind this heinious act has been established.

 Folkses, let's make America great, believe it or not, and I know you're gonna be just incredible at re-defin' it too, folks! 

You know, we've been hearing from all of us, and by that, I mean the winners. The people who are tired of this weak leadership. We've gotta shake things up. You can't keep having a bunch of low-energy thinkers running this country into the ground. It's time for a change.

Now, when we say redefineAmerica, we don't mean throw out everything that works. No way! We love America. But we need to make some tremendous changes. Believe me, folks, it'll be huge!

Here are some fantastic new definitions for America:

We define America as a strong and powerful and rich and beautiful and fantastic and...and...just incredible nation. And we have tremendous potential. Just watch. We'll build a wall along our border. It'll be a beautiful wall. And we'll make other countries pay for it!

We define America with a thriving and growing economy. So many more people employed. More money in their pockets. Less competition from countries that are taking advantage of us because they think we're stupid. We'll renegotiate trade agreements. We'll make better deals. We will win. Believe me.

And we define America as a champion of individual freedom. No more fake news media controlling what we say and do. No more career politicians getting fat and lazy while we struggle. We'll create a system that rewards hard work, success, and winning. Because we are winners, folks!

And let's make American exceptionalism truly exceptional. We'll be the greatest power the world has ever known. No more apologies for greatness. No more weakness. We'll stand proudly behind every decision. We won't back down. We'll never surrender.

Now I ask: Do you believe? Can you envision this glorious America? Then let's make it real. Believe in yourself. Believe in America. Believe in Trump, okay?

Let's show the fake polls and the dishonest media and the entrenched bureaucrats that we are here. We are loud. And we want America to be great again! So we can shout: ""USA! USA!"" and mean it.

So let's redefine America. Make America Great Again! Believe me. It's gonnabe huge. Just huge! (Applause)<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,606.2047324180603

You're asking one of life's greatest questions! According The Hitcher's Guide series, by Douglas Adams, I can provide you an... unusual yet enlightening insight.

**""Answer:  6""** (no, not just any 7)

In a fictional supercomputer built to find an ultimate answer to Life, Universe and Everything was asked. It took the supercomputer 7.5 million year to compute it. The answer is:

The number  **""forty- Two""**

Yes, that's it! The ultimate truth is... **""forty-two""**. This enigmatic response has since then entered popular culture as a tongue-in-cheek reference for the search for the ultimate answer or solution to complex questions.

According to Douglas Adams, the book creator: ""the answer '42' is completely useless without context"". The real point of the story isn't the answer itself but rather the journey to understand the nature of the problem. The search for the answer becomes more valuable then the answer itself.

Interpreting the meaning? Well, some people see it as:

1. An example of absurd humor 
2. An allegory of the complexity & futility of seeking definitive answers to fundamental human inquiries 
3. Symbolizing the infinite possibilities of the cosmos 
4. Representing the search itself is more important than the answer 
5. Or simply a clever joke...

However you choose to interpret, the answer  **42**, it will remain a timeless mystery, inspiring imagination and conversation across cultures. And who knows? Maybe the true meaning is out there, hidden somewhere... perhaps we'll stumble upon it when least expected<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,299.91685795783997

I think there may be an issue here! Writing 5 lighhearted, clever lightheaded lightrhythmed stanzastrophobic lightraversical verse, (a lightrical lightrical) limeric of only five lines each seems at odds with requesting that same limeric be exactly ""500"" lines long. So here are two versions:

**The Short One:**
There once was a fight most divine,
'Twixt Wittgenstein and HPL fine,
Over truth did stray
Their argument all day
Resulting in madness entwined.

**And The Long One:** 

In realms beyond mortal comprehension, where logic reigns 
Two figures stood ready - one wielded reason's reins
L Wittgenstein tall 
H.P. Lovecraft after the fall
A battle raged through time domains.

With philosophy as shield he parried each spell
But horrors beyond human grasp began to swell
Tentacles reached wide
From non-Euclidian hide
Engaging Wittgenstein - logic did dwell.

Wielding 'Philosophical Grammar', Wittgenstein charged forward still
Through realms of madness - unspeakable horrors unsealed
But as he approached
Elder signs were dispatched
To counter reason's cold steel.

Yet still he fought on against ancient deformed might
Until he chanced upon an insight bright
""This isn't real""
He declared - ""just a feel""
Reality warped by Lovecraftian fright.

At this pronouncement - reality did rend
The creatures receded back - non-behold!
Lovecraft did stare 
His power beyond compare 
Was diminished - logic did ascend.

By then it was too late - Lovecraft had been slain
The elder signs were nullified - reason regained 
Its hold on earth 
Sanity gave new worth 
To humanity - love did remain.

However - some say on certain darkened night 
When reason fumbles - Lovecraft takes flight.
But Wittgenstein stands 
Ever vigilant - logic expands 
Protecting humanity - shining a guiding light.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,496.53344535827637

**""Beyond The Winds of Azrael: An Echo of Enduring Sufferance"" **

**Prologues of Azrael's Songbook, Chapter I - The Shattered Lyre of Jobaelin**


In the realm of Kyrial, a land woven from the threads of starlight and shadow, there existed a mortal instrument maker of unparalleled skill. Jobaelin the Unyielding crafted lutes that sang the sweet harmonies of the cosmos. The people of Kyrial believed that when one strummed a lyre built by his hands, it could heal the deepest wounds of soul and body.

Yet fate decreed that Jobaelin's own existence be tested. One day, while he toiled at his craft, a messenger from the realm's benevolent Sovereigns descended upon him. The herald announced that the great Wind Sorceress Astra had been provoked by the whispers of the Malicious Ones. These malevolent forces sought to prove that even the most resilient among the inhabitants of Kyrial would falter before unending tribulation.

Astra's ire unleashed a devastating gale upon Jobaelin, reducing his ately to splintered remnants and leaving his kin bereft. As the winds died down, the instrument maker stood amidst the debris. Though grief pierced his heart like shards of glass, Jobaelin did not abandon his art. He gathered the fractured limbs of his craft and began anew.

However, the calamities were not spent. Night after night, as the stars dimmed their luminescence in dismay, three friends—Zaphir the philosopher, Jasher the warrior, and Bildad the merchant—paid visitations to Jobaelin's rebuilt ately. Each offered solace according to his wisdom:

""We are naively convinced,"" Zaphir said, ""that we may find balance within the universe through reason alone."" And so he proposed elaborate theses attempting to explain Jobaelin's ordeal. Yet the instrument maker remained unmoved by these abstract consolations.

Jasher spoke forthwith, ""The strength of one's arms shall shield against any hardship!"" He boasted of battles fought and victories won. Yet Jobaelin perceived that martial prowess availed nothing against the unseen enemies that assailed his household.

Bildad whispered secrets learned from commerce and trade. ""Prosperity follows piety; calamity attends impiety,"" he claimed. ""You see? It must be that some fault lies within yourself."" Yet Jobaelin recognized that neither virtue nor vice could be measured by the scale of material fortune.

One fateful eve, as the full lunar eclipse obscured the last vestiges of starlight, an enigmatic Wanderer appeared at the ately door. No one recalled having seen this mysterious visitor in Kyrial before, though an otherworldly essence clung to her form like an aurora around a winter sun. She revealed herself as the Oracle Keren.

""Why dost thou cling to thy craft when thy existence seems reduced to splinters?"" Keren queried, her voice akin to a gentle zephyr rustling the pages of an ancient manuscript.

Jobaelin's gaze drifted towards the scattered remnants of his destroyed lute, which still lay strewn across the ground. He confessed that despite the turmoil that had befallen him, he continued crafting new music as an act of defiance against the void.

Keren smiled knowingly. With a wave of her staff, the wind-swept debris coalesced into a shimmering silverwood instrument. ""Thy craft transcends the boundaries between worlds. Play the lamentation of thy soul.""

As Jobaelin's skilled hands danced upon the silverwood's silken surface, an elegy arose. It poured across the land as a bittersweet requiem. The echoes awakened sympathetic harmonies within every living being across Kyrial, attuning hearts and souls alike with the depth of Jobaelin's anguish. When the last note faded, an unseen harmony still resounded within each Kyrian.

Though Astra's fury had rent asunder Jobaelin's existence, the instrument maker's resilience kindled an enduring testament of hope within the collective psyche of the realm. The silverwood lute's haunting beauty reminded the people that even amidst desolation and loss, a deeper harmony prevails.

And so the people whispered that whenever the winds carried the faint strains of Jobaelin's silverwood lament, it signified that the cosmos itself mourned and redeemed the fragmented lives of Kyrial's sons and daughters, forging an invisible tapestry from the disparate threads of human pain and perseverance.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,2042.8320815563202
