Polite postponement of cooperation or collaboration at workplace can be challenging, but it's sometimes unavoidable due to unforeseen circumstances or conflicting commitments that may not align perfectly at all times.

### Crafting an Appropriate Postponement Communication

1\. **Be Immediate and Honest**: It‚Äôs best to let someone know about any changes or issues affecting collaboration plans immediately. The quicker someone knows about delays or changes in plans, the better equipped they are to adjust accordingly.

2\. 2. **Express Genuine Interest and Acknowlegment**:

    *Acknowlege and thank people involved: Expressing gratitude towards individuals who are willing to collaborate goes a long way, showing appreciation helps build trust and understanding.
    
    *Express genuine interest: Make sure to express genuine interest and enthusiasm about future collaboration prospects with other team members.



3\. 3. Provide Alternative Dates or Proposals:

    *Propose alternative dates for collaboration: If possible, suggest new dates or timelines when collaboration could resume or take place.
    
    *Open to negotiation: Be open to negotiating and finding mutual agreeable dates or arrangements that suit all parties involved.
    
    *Follow-up: Confirm any agreed upon changes or rescheduling through official communication such as emails or messages, ensuring that everything is clear and recorded appropriately.
    

4\. Show Empathy and Understanding: 

    *Acknowlege inconvenience: Acknowlege any inconvenience or disruption that postponements may cause, demonstrating empathy towards affected team members or collaborators.
    
    *Apologize genuinely: Offer sincere apologies and assure that steps will be taken to minimize similar occurrences moving forward.


5\. Maintain Professionalism and Respect: 

    *Be polite and considerate: Always remain polite, considerate, and friendly throughout communication, even when discussing challenges or setbacks.
    
    *End positively: End communication positively, reiterate commitment to collaboration, and express eaguardness to proceed once circumstances allow.<|eot_id|>",99.640291929245,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,390.7354667186737

These emojis and abbreviations appear be related, possibly from someone's bio or introduction.

??NY based??: The two flags are likely meant together as one symbol:???? (United States) and???? (New York state), which could indicate that they are based in or from New York City/New York.

??Ô∏è‚Äç????: This emoji shows two people holding hands. It typically means friendship, partnership, or relationship, possibly even marriage.

S'23: S might stand for ""Senior"" or another identifier, '23 indicates 2023, possibly referencing something specific that will occur or has occurred that year, e.g., graduating class of '23.

??Ô∏è‚Äç????: Another set of two people, possibly with similar meaning as mentioned above.

So, putting it all together:

This individual may be introducing themselves as living in or from new york, involved in some sort of relationship/partnership, graduating from S(omething) university or college class '23, or expecting some other important milestone or connection involving two people.

Softly falling morning light
Creates an atmosphere of calm and peace
Nature awakens from slumber
And all that was hidden now slowly appears

Dappled shadows cover ancient trees
Their branches stretching upwards, forever growing
Their limbs tangled together
In an eternal display of strength

Rivulet waters trickle over smooth rock
Echoing whispers of long-loathed secrets
The gentle breeze stirs rustling reeds
Stirring within us something profound

Memories unfold as we wander 
Recollections of days long past rise
Fading yet still holding significance
Time's mark left unerased.

Writing an efficient and compelling rebate can be challenging, but I've got you! 

To help you write one quickly, here's an easy 5-point formula that will save you time while ensuring you effectively counter any argument or claim.

**1) Acknowledge and Address: (approx 1 paragraph)
		+ Begin by acknowledging and addressing each point raised against your original statement.
		+ This shows that you're aware of their perspective and helps set the tone for a thoughtful response.

Example:
""I understand that my opponents may think that... (acknowledge), but I strongly disagree because... ""

**2) Counter Each Point: (approximately 1-3 paragraphs)
		+ Break down the argument into smaller parts and address each one individually.
		+ Provide evidence, examples, or logical reasoning that contradict the claims.

Example:
""Their assertion that 'X' implies 'Y' ignores crucial context. According to recent research/studied cases/historically, we can observe that 'Z', not 'Y'. Therefore...""

**3) Offer Alternatives or Exposing Fallacies: (approximately 100-200 words)
		+ Present alternative interpretations, facts, or scenarios that challenge their assumptions.
		+ Identify and expose fallacious reasoning or flawed methodology in order to weaken their case.

Example:
""A more accurate understanding suggests that 'A', rather than 'B', drives this issue. Furthermore, relying on faulty assumptions about 'C' undermines my opponents' conclusion.""

**4) Strengthen Original Claims: (approximately 100-200 words)
		+ Reinforce and expand upon key aspects of your initial argument using additional information, supporting evidence, or new insights.

Example:
""Moreover, my proposal has been shown to produce positive effects through 'D', 'E', and 'F', demonstrating its viability and effectiveness in real-world applications.""

**5) Conclusion: Summarize & Final Refutation (approx 50-100 words)
		+ Recap and reassert why your rebuttal stands strong against oppositional views.
		+ End with a clear call-to-action or decisive remark that solidifies your argument.

Example:
""In conclusion, after thoroughly evaluating both positions, it becomes apparent that my argument holds more water due to... Ultimately, this debate should center on verifiable evidence and sound reasoning ‚Äì not unsubstantiated assertions.""

Using this outline as a guideline should help you craft a well-rounded rebuttal relatively quickly. Remember to stay clear, direct, and engaging throughout.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,655.1896946430206

Sinclair Lewis' novel, **""** (1920) features an ensemble cast of fascinating and nuanced character portrayances that critique and satirize American culture, particularly within Mid-western towns.

Let's take an overview of key character archtypes:

* Caroline ""Carrie"" Milford: The protagonist of novel who represents a progressive and idealistic spirit struggling against small-town conventions.
- Will Kennicott: Her practical-minded and materialistic dentist who stands as embodiment for middle-American values.
* Miles Blount: An outsider who challenges local norms by expressing his individuality.
- Sam Clarke: The town's mayor who symbolizes entrenched power structures and resistance to change.

These characters embody societal forces like progress vs. tradition, individualism vs. collectivism. They are multidimensional and flawed making them feel realistic and thought-providingly human.

Feel free to provide any additional context or information regarding these characters or Sinclair Lewis' other literary pieces - I'd be eager to engage and help expand discussion.

**What makes an ideal example of writing?**
An ideal example should include all key components and be free from errors, easy and quick read, and should not be too wordy or complicated.

**What does it consist of?**

1.  An example should have clear instructions and provide context for readers who are new to this type of writing.
2.  It should be well-written, engaging, and free of grammatical errors.
3.  The tone should be professional, objective, and neutral.
4.  It should provide enough information for readers to understand and learn about a particular topic.
5.  It should be written concisley, focusing on one central argument, point, or key take away.

A perfect summary is one that effectively conveys a lot of information within limited words without losing any important details. It's a delicate balance between concisenity, accuracy, clarity, precision, thoroughness, and coherence. I hope this helps you create a perfect summary for your next assignment!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,138.96555161476135

What an delightful and fictional controversy! 

**Setting:** The Greenroom at Hay Literary Festival, UK.

**Characters:**
**Jo (Jo Rowling):** The famous British novelist, best know as J.K.Rowling
**Rob (Rob/Robert Galbraith):** Pseudonym of... well, you'll see...

**Dialogue:**

[Jo storms backstage to find a calm-looking person sitting at a table]

**Jo:** (outraged) You!
**Rob:** (confused) Jo? Can I help?

**Jo:** (wagging a finger) Don't play dumb with me, Mr. Cuckoo Clock. I've read ""The Cuckoo's Calling"". That book has more borrowed bits from Harry Potter than a Hogwarts' student has scarves.

**Rob:** (laughs) Oh dear, I don't quite follow. How can you possibly claim that?

**Jo:** (forcefully) Don't feign innocence. I've seen it. The themes, the character archetypes... it's all too reminiscent of Hogwarts. And don't eventgetme started on that detective's assistant. He's practically a carbon copy of... (pauses for dramatic effect)...Rita Skeeter!

**Rob:** (still chuckling) Well, Jo, I must say I flattered that you'd consider such a connection.

**Jo:** (flustered) Stop being coy and admit it! You've clearly drawn inspiration from mine works. Perhaps we should discuss this further... over a lawyer's letter?

**Rob:** (leaning forward) Alright, let's clear this up. My name is not just Rob. It's... (pausing for dramatic effect)...Robert Galbraith, pen name for... (leaning in closer) J.K. Rowling.

[Jo looks stunned]

**Jo:** (stammering) R-Rob...but...how could...? That means...(realization sets in)

**Rob:** (mirthlessly grinning) You were accusing yourself of plagiarism, Jo.

**Jo:** (sheepsishly laughing) Oh dear Lord, I feel rather silly now...

**Rob:** (chuckles) No worries, Jo. We all make mistakes.

Mighty monarch of ancient lands,
Elephant, symbol of wisdom's hands,
Gray and gentle, yet oh-so-strong,
Roaming free, where legends belong.

Trumpets blared, as tusker takes lead,
March of majesty, through grasslands freed,
With trunk held high,
The elephant's stride,
Treads softly by,
On ancestral ground, sacred deed.

A creature grand,
Intelligence shines bright in every stand,
Social bonds that last,
Through seasons vast,
Family first,
Community at heart,
Protecting all,
From life to start.

Curious minds,
Unravel secrets left behind,
In whispers told,
Ancien knowledge unfold,
Echoing across time,
Elephants' collective prime.

As sunsets fade,
Their silhouettes displayed,
A legacy lives,
A tale of survival thrives,
Respected elders,
Gathering hearts still,
Their wisdom guides,
The hermitage inside.

Time stands still,
Under starry skies so bright,
Elephants walk,
A shadow of a night,
Leaving prints,
Forever aligned with light.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,140.41112446784973

**Shakespeare's Sonne 130: My Mistress' Eyes (Original)**
If eyes, which are said beauty's gates,
Be not as bright as golden sun,
Then I am no judge of beauty's state;
No light can be where there is none.

Her eyebrows are as black as night,
Her skin as pale as alabaster stone,
Yet still she shines, though but dimly bright,
And hath more beauty in one glance alone
Than many fairer ladies' faces show.

But thou, O mistress mine, dost know thyself,
How dearly I esteem thee, dearer still,
That beauty's self may be thy dowry to show,
And that, I swear, I'll never let it chill.

**The SpongeBob SquarePants Version: Oh, Krabby Patty Mine**
If Krabby Patties, which are said taste divine,
Are not as tasty as Mr. Krabs' gold,
Then I'm no connoisseur of fast food fine;
No flavor's there when hunger's old.

Their pickles are as sour as a grump's sneer,
Their cheese as melted as Squidward's heart,
Yet still I yearn for that salty cheer,
And find it better, a snack apart.

But oh, dear Patty, oh so dear,
You know yourself, I'll eat thee every time,
Though some say ""too many,"" I'll never tire or peer,
For thee, I'll stand, a hungry customer sublime!

After digging through vast amounts of narrative research and analyses, I've curated an unusual list of lesser-utilizeed (but not unheard of) narrative devices and character archtypes that could add fresh flavor and depth when employed effectively.

**Least Used Storytelling Tropes:**
1. The **""Unlikable Prodigy""**: An extremely talented individual struggling to find purpose or connection despite exceptional skill sets.
2. **The ""Failed Mentor Figure""**: An authority figure guiding someone new fails spectacularly and learns as much (if not more) from failure as do his or her pupil.
3. **The ""Non-Cathartic Confrontation""**: Characters confront each other without resolution; it ends ambiguouly or even worsens relations.
4. **The ""Selfless Anti-Hero""**: Unlike typical anti-heroes, this character prioritizes altruism over selfish motivations but is still flawed and imperfect.
5. **The ""Rationalization Loop""**: Characters are trapped in internal monologues where logic and reason are used for destructive self-justification.
6. **The ""Reformed Villain's Inner Turmoil""**: Focus is given on former villains' inner conflict and emotional struggle post-transformation.
7. **An ""Unreliable Omniscient""** narrator intentionally withholding information from readers while appearing all-knowing.
8. **A ""Redemption Through Selflessness...of Others""**: Characters achieve redemption by supporting others' heroic acts instead of undertaking them personally.
9. **The ""Tragic Backstory Reversal""**: Instead of being sympathetic to characters because of past suffering, it's revealed the character caused pain to others.
10. **Inversion of ""The Big Save"" Trope**: Heroes fail to save someone important to them and grapple with guilt and responsibility.

These lesser-used narrative techniques can be leveraged to create complex characters and thought-providing themes that challenge both writers and audiences alike.

You're interested in high-end speakers! The DALI (Dalian Loud-speAKER) EPicon 6 and EPicon 8, as part of DALI's EPicon series, are highly praised by many, but I believe you meant DALI Rubicon or perhaps most likely,  ""Dali Obeirn"", which is not a model, however I think I see a typo there.

Perhaps it should be: ""Dali OBERONS"". Which is an old model line that is still highly sought after for audiophiles who enjoy classic speakers.

DALI OBERON is a compact bookshelf speaker system designed to deliver clear, natural, wide-dispersion, dynamic, precise, undistorted, bass reproduction, even when listening near or well-off axes.

Here are some key characteristics:

1.  Cabinet design: The cabinet is designed to reduce internal resonances and improve overall performance.

2.  Driver design: It utilizes a hybrid tweeter design, combining a silk dome with a custom-ordered ferrite magnet system to achieve extended and smooth mid-range.

3.  Crossover network: The crossover network is optimized to maintain phase coherence while ensuring proper time alignment.

4.  Frequency response: The speakers' flat frequency response ensures that each note is reproduced accurately without any unnatural peaks or dips.

5.  Sensitivity: They are relatively sensitive at 88 dB, which makes them easy to power.

Do keep in mind these are older speakers, and newer versions might be available.

**Photo Title: The Dragon's Ascension - Rand al'TThor at Shayol Gul's Peak** 

**Camera Details:** 
DSRL Camera: EOS 5D Mark IV
Lens: EF 24mm, 1/125, f/11
Shooting Mode: Manual
ISO: ISO2000

**Description:**
A dramatic photograph of the pivotal moment when the fate of the Wheel of Time was sealed. The photo depicts the climactic confrontation between the Dragon and the Dark One at the peak of Shayol Ghul. The frame freezes the moment right after the Bore has been sealed, and the Dark One's forces are beginning to dissipate.

In center frame stands an exhausted yet resolute Randall ""The Dragon"" Al'thor, his sword held high as a symbol of triumph. His clothing and armor show the wear of the long journey and the brutal fight that preceded this moment, but his spirit remains unbroken. The light from the setting sun behind him outlines his silhouette against the darkening backdrop of the mountains.

To his sides stand his friends and supporters‚ÄîNynaeve al'Meara, Matrim (mat) Cautyln, Perrin Aybara, and other figures who stood by him through thick and thin. Their faces are illuminated with hope and disbelief as they realize what they've accomplished.

In the distant background lies an ethereal glow that hints at the aftermath of their struggle. The once darkened skies now show promise of new life and renewal, reflecting not just the physical environment but also the emotional and spiritual transformation that these heroes and heroines endured.

The overall mood of the photo exudes resilience, unity, and hope for a brighter future. It's not merely an act captured; it's an era-changing moment that redefines history.

**Post-production notes:**
Minor retouching to adjust contrast and saturation to better capture the true color palette of that extraordinary day. No major alterations were made to ensure authenticity. The raw emotion and power of the moment remain undisturbed.

Appying Non Violant Communication (NV) or Violence Free Communication (VC) at workplace can be challenging, but it's definitely possible and beneficial! Developed by psychiatrist and conflict-resolution consultant,  here are several methods you can use: 

1\. Separate observation from evaluation: When expressing yourself, focus on the concrete actions that affect the situation rather than making judgments or criticisms. Use ""what I see"", ""what I hear"" or ""what I notice"".

2\. Expressing Feelings: Say how you feel without attacking or judging anyone else.

3\. Make clear requests: Specify what you want to occur, being as specific as possible, including when, where, and how.

4\. Seek first to understand, not to win an argument: Be willing to learn from each other and seek solutions that satisfy all parties involved.

5\. Use active listening: Repeat what the speaker said to ensure that we understand what was meant.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,112.72200226783752

What an unusual and delightful prompt! I've crafted two poems justfor you, one lightheaded and another slightly serious.

**Whiskers and Numbers (a lightheaded take)**
 
Three blind mice, no ‚Äì three clever rats,
Stumbled upon a book of fancy stats.
They learned to count by whisker twigs,
And mastered fractions by sharing figgy rigs.

In hidden holes below street level play,
The rambunctious rodents practiced each day.
Add 'em all up with twitch of ear,
Multiply by squeaks that echo near.

Their teacher rat said ""You see it's fine,
Mathematics isn't hard when in rhyme!""
He showed off charts of tasty treats,
Divided among friends who eat discreet.

Those curious critters caught arithmetic fast,
Soon calculating routes to snacks at last!
Word got around: Rats can crunch some code,
For dinner parties planned by number nodes.

**Rodent Mathematicians (a more serious tone)**

Within labyrinth corridors beneath stone ground,
A group of rodents sought knowledge profound.
Curiosity drove them to learn anew,
To understand laws governing their world in hue.

One keen-eyed fellow noticed paths laid out,
Connected by angles, straight, curved, deviate and rout.
An idea struck him - patterns could be found,
Like geometric secrets whispered all unround.

Through trial and error the rodents did strive
Using pebbles as markers, solving sums to arrive,
Commuting distances between food stores vast,
They employed vectors to calculate what to forecast.

With every step forward insight grew,
A new perspective opened; as one would pursue,
Numbers revealed truths within their maze,
As understanding bloomed within their maze-raising days.

Their discoveries spread throughout their realm,
Empowering others to master numerical helm.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,349.9922332763672
