[2024-02-23 12:34:48,974][__main__][INFO] - Mutated text: Original Text: The Eiffel Tower is known for its metallic lattice construction and three floors. It is located in the heart of Paris, France and towers over the city at a height of 324 meters. This magnificent structure covers an area of around 108,000 square meters. Its framework consists of four significant lattice supports that interconnect at the middle part, gradually narrowing upwards until reaching the highest point. There are also two smaller observation decks near the base, providing distinct vantage points for visitors. The iconic tower was painted in a red-brown hue when it was first constructed and has since become famous all across the world after its completion in 1889.

Edited Sentence: Updated Version: The Eiffel Tower is famous for its metal lattice framework and three levels. Located in central Paris, France, it soars at a peak of 324 meters above sea level. Boasting a total surface area of approximately 108,000 square meters, this remarkable structure has a frame consisting of four major lattice supports that link together at their midpoint and narrow progressively as they climb towards the summit. Two additional observation decks are positioned nearby, offering unique perspectives for sightseers. Initially painted in a reddish-brown color upon its inauguration in 1889, the Eiffel Tower quickly garnered international acclaim.

Spanning an area of about 108,000 square meters, this impressive feat includes a frame built from four essential lattice supports, which widen from the middle upwards before gradually tapering to their highest point. In addition to these, there are two secondary viewing platforms located close by, offering alternative vistas for visitors. Originally painted a reddish-brown colour upon its dedication in 1889, the iconic landmark rapidly became renowned worldwide.

Edited Sentence: Updated Version: As a prominent symbol of the city of Paris, the Eiffel Tower stands as the tallest structure within its boundaries and one of the world's most recognized landmarks. Constructed during the years 1887-1889 under the leadership of Gustave Eiffel, the tower rises to a height of 324 meters (equivalent to 1,063 feet) and thus surpasses any other European building in terms of elevation.
