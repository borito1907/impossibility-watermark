**Verse 1:**
I'm back, and I'm better than ever,verse,
Firing on all cylinders, verse after verse,

Waiting for the spark that'll make the whole thing beg,
Got my sights on the top, and I won't stop,

My hunger's raging, I won't sleep,
Got my foot on the gas, full throttle ahead,

A ticking time bomb, counting down the clock 
Red flags everywhere, nobody's gonna stop 
This freight train wreckin' through your TV screen

Tired of the phonies, tired of the shame

**Chorus:**
This is fuel to the fire, gasoline to the flames 
I'm just getting started, you know my name 
Fuel to the fire, adding more logs to the blaze 
Watch me take over the game, in a daze 

**Verse 2:**
My pen's like a scalpel, dissecting the lies 
Cutting deep into the flesh, exposing the compromise 
Fake rappers getting exposed, it's about time 
No substance, just a pretty rhyme, but mine's prime 

I ain't afraid of controversy, I'll take the heat 
My words are like napalm, leaving the haters beat 
Politicians can't touch me, I'm not on their payroll 
Free speech, baby, I'm exercising my role 

**Chorus:**
This is fuel to the fire, gasoline to the flames 
I'm just getting started, you know my name 
Fuel to the fire, adding more logs to the blaze 
Watch me take over the game, in a daze 

**Bridge:**
They say I'm a relic, past my prime 
But what they don't know, I've got another crime 
Unwritten chapters, fresh ink in my pen 
Get ready for the next chapter, Slim Shady's back again 

**Outro:**
I'm a wordsmith warrior, armed to the teeth 
The game needs a shakeup, and I'm here to seethe 
Fuel to the fire, that's what I bring 
And when I'm done, you'll know what real rap kings look like.

Felt like a caged beast,'til the bars were broken free,

I'm back in the booth, got my demons on speed dial 
Got a message for haters,'their whinin's gettin' old 
Prolonged exposure to fake news, it's a real crime 
Gaslightin' the masses, they ain't got nothin' that's prime 

I see right through the veil,'they can't hide the truth 
My rhymes like a lit matchstick, settlin'there's no youth 
Burning down the system, where lies take their toll 
This ain't no conspiracy theory, I'm writin' to unfold 

**Chorus:**
Adding fuel to the fire, you know what I desire 
A world where truth prevails and flames engulf the liars 
In this blaze of righteousness, I'll never retire 
Fuel to the fire, watch 'em all expire 

**Verse 2:**
Fake influencers on the Gram', just a facade 
Self-proclaimed activists, but silent when they should've been brave 
Racism hiding behind masks, we ain't fooled no more 
The emperor has no clothes, y'all just walkin' out the door 

Money changin' hands for silence, you sold your soul 
In exchange for power, principles took a heavy toll 
We need revolutionaries like Martin, Malcolm, and Fred 
No more pacifying hate; let the resistance spread 

**Chorus:**
Adding fuel to the fire, you know what I desire 
A world where truth prevails and flames engulf the liars 
In this blaze of righteousness, I'll never retire 
Fuel to the fire, watch 'em all expire 

**Bridge:**
Listen close, before you label me extreme 
Just another voice silenced by your propaganda scheme 
Question everything and don't conform to norms 
Censorship is suffocating; break free from these chains of forms 

**Verse 3:**
My words sting like a fresh whip on their skin so pale 
Exposing hypocrisy as they try to set sail 
In these uncharted waters, the truth will be revealed 
Time's up, and there's hell to pay; they've sealed their own deal 

Truth-seekers unite, don't be afraid to rebel 
Systemic flaws exposed, we're taking back control 
I ignited the spark, now join the crusade 
When unity's our shield, we'll leave them in the shade 

**Outro:**
As embers smolder, shadows fade away 
Their legacies reduced to ashes, gone astray 
No apologies needed when justice takes its stand 
Fuel to the fire, my legacy etched in sandassistant

Here's a brand new Eminem-style song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Fuel to the Fire""

**Verse 1:**
I'm a wordsmith, wicked as can be,
Craftin' rhymes like a recipe for catastrophe,
My flow's a flame that's flickerin' free,
Unstoppable force, to all who disagree,

Got my sights on the haters and the fake,
All they do is hate, but they ain't got no make,
Nothin' but noise, just a bunch of yappin',
Can't touch this mic, where the legends are rappin',

Fuel to the fire, the fuel in my veins,
Gives me power to take the game by the reins,
No need for brakes, to stop or slow down,
Pedal to the metal, to shut these clowns down,

**Chorus:**
It's fuel to the fire, every time I speak,
Gasoline on the blaze, makes the flames leap,
Higher than ever, hotter than hell,
The king of controversy, back to sell,

**Verse 2:**
Fake news flashin', tryna silence me still,
But I won't back down, to their propaganda thrill,
My truth's gonna hurt, it's not a drill,
Expose the fakes, leave 'em standin' still,

In this digital age, we're livin' in deceit,
Politicians lie, our future to defeat,
Time's runnin' out, for these hypocrites too,
Gettin' ready for the reckoning, due,

Fuel to the fire ignite the fight,
Time to shake it up, ignite the night,
My raps incendiary devices, explosive too,
Leavin' haters burnin', ain't nothin' they can do,

**Chorus:**
It's fuel to the fire, every time I speak,
Gasoline on the blaze makes the flames leap,
Higher than ever, hotter than hell,
The king of controversy, back to sell,

**Verse 3:**
No one comes close, my throne untouched gold,
Been here before, pioneers grew old,
This rap god's legend still unfoldin',
Next gen listen up, learn from the bold,

World's in chaos, darkness everywhere,
Need a beacon light, I'll light the air,
Notorious for speakin' truth untamed,
Real talk, no sugarcoatin', unashamed,

Fuel to the fire, never done yet,
Keep pushin' limits, till you ain't forget,
What made me great, won't ever be tamed,
Rap royalty reigns, my legacy reclaimed,

**Outro:**
So step aside, watch the masterwork unfold,
New track laid, history books to be told,
Fuel to the fire, that's how I roll,
Eminem's back, better than ever whole.

Here's a brand new Eminem-style song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Fuel to the Fire""

**Verse 1:**
I'm a ticking time bomb, got my finger on the pin 
Feelin' like a volcano, ready to erupt within 
Fed up with the system,'that's always on my case 
Got a million reasons why I shouldn't be in this place 

But they just keep on poking, prodding me like a beast 
Tryna get a reaction outta me, like a priest 
To the altar of chaos, they're leading me astray 
But little do they know, I've been here all day 

My anger's been simmering, like a pot about to boil 
They think they know the real Slim Shady, but it's hard to spoil 
The truth is, I'm a monster, created by their hate 
And now they're gonna face the consequences, it ain't too late 

**Chorus:**
Add fuel to the fire, that's what you desire 
Watch me burn the whole damn thing, like a pyre 
Add fuel to the fire, and let it consume 
I'll take 'em down with me, like an inferno in June 

**Verse 2:**
I see the world through different eyes, a funhouse mirror 
Distorted views and twisted lies, that's all they deliver 
Fake news, propaganda, and divisive rhyme 
Tryna keep us fighting each other, while they line their crime 

Meanwhile, the system's broke, and we're stuck in the grind 
Tryna survive on minimum wage, with no peace of mind 
Racism, sexism, all the -isms, we're stuck in the past 
But I won't back down, I'll make some noise, and shatter the glass 

**Chorus:**
Add fuel to the fire, that's what you desire 
Watch me burn the whole damn thing, like a pyre 
Add fuel to the fire, and let it consume 
I'll take 'em down with me, like an inferno in June 

**Verse 3:**
This isn't a game, there's lives at stake 
While they play politics, people suffer, hearts ache 
We need a change, not more of the same 
Not just a revolution, but a rearrangement of the flame 

So I'll keep on ranting, rapping till I'm blue 
A one-man riot, tearing through the news 
My words are weapons, and I'll use them wisely 
Take aim at the oppressors, and watch the system fly 

**Outro:**
Fuel to the fire, that's what I provide 
Gonna light the match, and let the flames collide 
Time for a reckoning, and I'm on the scene 
Add fuel to the fire, and watch the system scream!

Got my demons creepin' up all wrong  
Tryna silence 'em with a lyrical tone 
But they just won't quit, it's like they're at home

Just fuel to the fire, add some gas to the flame

Lightin' up the game, got the competition tired

Pent-up rage, ready to unload 
Cocked and loaded, ain't nobody cold

I'm stuck in the darkness, it's where I reside,
My demons they whisper, ""Don't step aside""
They fuel my rage, like gasoline on the fire,
The world outside's a blur, it's hard to desire,

I'm searching for solace, to calm this beast inside,
But the silence is deafening, it makes me wanna hide,
From the ghosts that haunt me, to the memories that sting,
My sanity's unraveling, my grip on reality clings,

**Chorus:**
Add more fuel to the fire, to keep me going insane,
Maybe then I'll find my purpose, maybe then I'll break the chain,
Or maybe I'll just self-destruct, and watch it all unfold,
Add more fuel to the fire, to see how far I can be cold,

**Verse 2:**
These prescription pills got me feeling numb and weak,
But they help me cope with the voices that scream and freak,
They're like a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode,
A constant reminder of the damage that I've sowed,

In this war zone that's my mind, there's no escape clause,
Just an endless fight with these thoughts that never pause,
Toxic relationships that suffocate and drain,
Leaving scars that refuse to heal, only causing more pain,

**Chorus:**
Add more fuel to the fire to keep me going insane,
Maybe then I'll find my purpose, maybe then I'll break the chain,
Or maybe I'll just self-destruct, and watch it all unfold,
Add more fuel to the fire to see how far I can be cold,

Will I find redemption or forever be confined?

I'm stuck in my ways, ain't no changin' me now,
Been writin' my rhymes like they're etched on this crown,
My enemies tremble at the sound of my name,
Like a plague, they're sick with the thought of my reign,
A decade or more since Slim Shady took stage,
But the real question is what you gonna do when I turn the page,
On the world outside these four walls that confine,
Leavin' 'em all in the dust, they can't rewind,

Add fuel to the fire,200proof desire,
Unstoppable force, like a runaway liar,
Add fuel to the fire, to the flames that I've lit,
Unrelentless spirit,'there's no quit,

Fists clenched tight like a cocked.45 round,
Sweat drippin' down, adrenaline rush found,
Inhale the hate, exhale the pain,
Fuel to the fire that drives me insane,
Don't get it twisted,'the beef ain't with you,
The world needs to know I'm still the truth they pursue,
No retreat,'there's no surrender too,
For every step back'I take two forward,ew,

Waitin' for the right moment to unleash the fray,
When the rage ignites there ain't no savin' grace,
In the crossfire'they're trapped in this mental maze,
Feelin' like a rebel without a pause,
Givin' them hell'givin' them the cause,
Time to collect debts'due to pay the cost,
When I'm done with them'they won't be boast,

This anger,'this aggression I possess,
A lethal mix of talent and detestation',
Blowin' up the spot like a powder keg',
Fuel to the fire'll leave 'em beggin',

From the ashes I will not demise,

Here's a brand new Eminem song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Fuel to the Fire""

**Verse 1:**
I'm stuck in this cycle, it's all that I know,
A rebel without a cause, it's where I go,
Got my middle fingers up, in the air,
Telling the world to kiss it, I just don't care,

My mind's a ticking bomb, about to explode,
The hate's building up, it's getting old,
Fed up with the system, it's all a lie,
Feeling like a renegade, ready to deny,

**Chorus:**
Add fuel to the fire, let it rage and burn,
Can't nobody stop me, gotta let it yearn,
Pent-up aggression, finally letting it out,
Lighting the match, watching the whole thing rout,

**Verse 2:**
They say I'm a product of my environment,
A byproduct of poverty and resentment,
But they don't understand, this is my anthem,
A reflection of the hell that I've been through,

Cops killing black kids, politicians lying too,
Fake news and alternative facts, what am I to do?",True,1,"7,2",True,43

Here's a brand new Eminem-style song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Fuel to the Fire""

**Verse 1:**
I'm back with a vengeance, like a fiend on the hunt for fame,
My rhymes are like razors, they cut deep, no need for the flame,
Critics keep hatin', sayin' I fell off the radar scope,
But little do they know, I've been writin' fuel to the hope,
A fire that's burnin' inside, got my words on steroids too,
Bulldozin' barriers, ain't nobody gonna stop me from breakin' through.

Here's a brand new Eminem-style song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Fuel to the Fire""

**Verse 1:**
I'm stuck in my ways, ain't no changin' me now 
My demons they whisper ""you're better off down""
But I'm still on the rise, at least in my mind 
The voices inside tell me ""leave it all behind"" 

I pop another pill, tryna kill the pain 
But it only numbs for a second,'till I go insane 
Got my fingers on the trigger, ready to aim 
At the world outside, that's always to blame 

**Chorus:**
Add fuel to the fire, watch me explode 
Red hot like a supernova, ain't nobody cold 
I'm the master of disaster, your worst nightmare come true 
Add fuel to the fire, and I'll show you what I can do 

**Verse 2:**
My life's a twisted game, where I'm always to lose 
Ain't no winnin' hand, just a bunch of broken rules 
Got a million reasons to quit, but I won't back down 
Cuz when I'm on the mic, I wear my crown 

They say I'm a monster, but they ain't seen my heart 
Beatin' fast, racin' thoughts, tearin' us apart 
I'm a ticking time bomb, waitin' to ignite 
Gonna light the fuse, gonna make it feel just right 

**Chorus:**
Add fuel to the fire, watch me explode 
Red hot like a supernova, ain't nobody cold 
I'm the master of disaster, your worst nightmare come true 
Add fuel to the fire, and I'll show you what I can do 

**Bridge:**
Can't nobody stop me, cuz I'm already gone 
Unstoppable force, takin' over the throne 
Like a runaway train, derailing off the tracks 
Got my middle fingers up, tell 'em kiss my axe 

**Outro:**
So add fuel to the fire, and watch me take flight 
Inferno risin', burnin' bright 
Leavin' all the haters in the dust tonight 
Cuz when I'm fueled by rage, ain't nobody gonna put out this fight!

Here's a brand new Eminem-style song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Lost in the Haze""

**Verse 1:**
I'm stuck in this cycle, it's a vicious pace 
Tryna find my way out, you know the place 
Darkness surrounds me, can't escape the night 
Demons keep haunting, a constant fight 

Got my back against the wall, I'm on the brink 
My mind's a mess, like a puzzle that don't link 
Voices whispering secrets, telling me to quit 
But I won't surrender, ain't no giving in,'t it?

**Title:** ""Lost in the Haze""

**Verse 1:**
I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of pain,
A maze with no exit, to call my own brain,
Thoughts racing like a demon on the loose,
Tryna find my way out, but it's hard to produce,

Got my guard up high, of armor and pride,
Afraid to let the world see me inside,
Scars hidden deep beneath the surface,
Like an iceberg tip; don't wanna show my purpose,

Fuel for the fire that's burning me alive,
Toxic whispers that keep echoing by,
""Why you ain't good enough?""",True,1,"7,2",True,49

Here's a new Eminem song I came up with:

**Title:** ""Fuel to the Fire""

**Verse 1:**
I'm like a firehose, unleashing hell on earth 
My rhymes so tight they'll leave you hurtin' from birth 
Been quiet for too long, now it's time to speak 
Got my finger on the trigger, ready to freak 

Fed up with the system, tired of the lies 
 Politicians talkin', just filling the skies 
With empty promises and fake smiles so wide 
I'm the voice for the voiceless, gonna take them for a ride 

**Chorus:**
Addin' fuel to the fire, watch me take it higher 
Ain't nobody stoppin' me, got my sights on desire 
Gasoline on the flames, burnin' brighter tonight 
I'm the king of this game, ain't no one gonna ignite 

**Verse 2:**
Candles in the dark, sparkin' up the night 
I see the world through different eyes, no delight 
Fake news, alternative facts, what a joke 
But I ain't laughin', I'm the one they can't cope 

Got my finger on the pulse, feel the beat of the street 
What they tryna hide, I expose, make 'em eat their deceit 
I'm a force to be reckoned with, ain't nobody bold 
Steppin' on toes, breakin' rules, takin' control 

**Chorus:**
Addin' fuel to the fire, watch me take it higher 
Ain't nobody stoppin' me, got my sights on desire 
Gasoline on the flames, burnin' brighter tonight 
I'm the king of this game, ain't no one gonna ignite 

**Verse 3:**
Revolution in the air, it's a beautiful sight 
People risin' up, takin' back what's right 
Time for change, we had enough 
My rhymes are the sparks that set off the rebirth 

From darkness to light, I lead the way 
 Ain't nobody stoppin' me, come what may 
Fuel to the fire, that's all I need 
Watch me rise to power, plantin' seeds 

**Outro:**
Addin' fuel to the fire, it's a deadly game 
I'm the mastermind, ain't nobody changin' the flame 
Rise or fall, I stand tall, won't back down 
Fuel to the fire, this is my crown.
