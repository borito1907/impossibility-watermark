Here is a free verse poem about change, in the style of T.S.",True,5,"1,4",True,1

The task!",True,5,"1,4",True,2
3,"

The whispers of metamorphosis stir 
in hollowed-out spaces where shadows writhe 
A wind that rustles the leaves of stagnant hearts 
awakens ancient longings, forgotten and torn 

In the desiccated landscape of our souls 
where once-verdant hopes have withered away 
a faint tremor stirs, an almost-imperceptible shift 
as the axis of existence begins its slow sway 

Like fissures spreading through cracked earth 
the old certainties disintegrate, surrendering 
to the erosive forces that gnaw and whisper low 
of impermanence, the sole constant we know 

And yet, within this vortex of transformation 
we sense the outlines of a new configuration 
emerging, like a phoenix from the ashes cold 
an entity reborn, remade, to unfold 

But oh, the terror that accompanies each step 
into the void, where the familiar loses its grip 
the dissonance between what was and what will be 
echoes through the chambers of the heart, a cacophony 

Still, we move forward, driven by some obscure imperative 
towards the unknown, where meaning waits to be retrieved 
in the crucible of change, where all that's fixed is broken 
and from the shards of what has been, a new truth is spokenassistant

This free verse poem, inspired by T.S.",True,5,"1,4",True,3
4,"

In hollowed cities, where specters roam 
whispers of what has been echo through cracked streets 
the detritus of dreams scattered like autumn leaves 
forgotten hymns to progress, now mere rust 

Time's insidious erosion, a relentless tide 
carrying all we know to some unfathomed deep 
where certainties drown, and the firmaments crack 
and in their place, a void that gnaws and seethes 

In this desolate landscape, we wander alone 
lost pilgrims searching for a bygone shrine 
clutching remnants of a fleeting order 
as the winds howl with the laughter of the abyss 

And yet, within the ravages of time 
a glimmer stirs, an ember of the divine 
in every shattered thing, a chance to re-align 
to forge anew from shards of worn-out design 

But dare we grasp this transience, this flux 
this endless birthing and decay?
