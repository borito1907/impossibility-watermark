Here's a set of lyrics in the style of Metallica:

**Song Title:** ""Crimson Reckoning""

**Verse 1:**
In the depths of my darkest night, I feel your presence drawing near 
A whisper in my ear, a warning unspoken fear 
The shadows cast their spell, a silhouette so grand and wide 
I'm bound by chains of fate, as the reaper comes to take his pride 

**Chorus:**
Rise up, crimson reckoning, the end is all that's mine 
Ashes of redemption, scattered like the damned in time 
No escape from this abyss, forever lost in the haze 
The price of mortal sin, eternal damnation's gaze 

**Verse 2:**
Echoes of a distant past, a haunting melody of pain 
Forever trapped in this hell, where darkness reigns supreme again 
Through flames that burn within, I see the ghost of what I've done 
The weight of every secret, crushes me beneath its stone 

**Chorus:**
Rise up, crimson reckoning, the end is all that's mine 
Ashes of redemption, scattered like the damned in time 
No escape from this abyss, forever lost in the haze 
The price of mortal sin, eternal damnation's gaze 

**Bridge:**
Beyond the gates of despair, I'll find my final stand 
Where demons wait in silence, hand in hand with my command 
The battle rages on inside, as I face my darkest fears 
Will I rise or fall to ashes, through these burning tears?

**Title:** ""Burning Inferno""

**Verse 1:**
In the depths of my soul, a fire's raging on 
A burning inferno that's never gone cold 
The flames of fury, a blaze that never fades 
As I rise up from the ashes, an avenger made 

**Chorus:**
Unchain the beast, let it run wild and free 
Untamed and furious, a force of anarchy 
Breaking chains,'tear down walls 
Unleashing hell, standing tall 

**Verse 2:**
Through the smoke and the flames, I see the lies 
The deceit and the shame, a world that denies 
The truth is hidden, but I'll find my way 
Through the darkness, I'll seize the day 

**Chorus:**
Unchain the beast, let it run wild and free 
Untamed and furious, a force of anarchy 
Breaking chains, tear down walls 
Unleashing hell, standing tall 

**Bridge:**
In this maelstrom, I'm lost and alone 
But still I'll rise, with every bone 
The fury inside, it drives me on 
No peace until the battle's won 

**Chorus:**
Unchain the beast, let it run wild and free 
Untamed and furious, a force of anarchy 
Breaking chains, tear down walls 
Unleashing hell, standing tall

**""Burning Inferno""**

Verse 1:
In the depths of my soul, there's a fire that breeds rage and despair 
A furnace of fury, fed by the flames that I've learned to bear 
The embers of anger glow like hot coals in my mind 
Waiting to ignite, the inferno that I've left behind 

Chorus:
I'm burning in the darkness, consumed by the blaze 
A never-ending torment, that fuels my endless days 
Unrelenting fury, coursing through every vein 
I'm trapped in this hellfire, where my demons reign 

Verse 2:
Memories of pain and sorrow, etched on my brain like scars 
A canvas of cruelty, painted with the colors of shame and fear 
The shadows that haunt me still,'they whisper ""you're not free"" 
A constant reminder of the chains that bind me 

Chorus:
I'm burning in the darkness, consumed by the blaze 
A never-ending torment, that fuels my endless days 
Unrelenting fury, coursing through every vein 
I'm trapped in this hellfire, where my demons reign 

Bridge:
Will I ever find my way out of this perpetual night?

**Song Title:** ""Burning Inferno""

**Verse 1:**
In the depths of darkness, I feel the fire rise 
A burning rage that never subsides 
The flames that fuel my soul, they never cease 
As I march towards the abyss, no peaceful release 

**Chorus:**
I'm drowning in the inferno, suffocating in the heat 
My screams are lost in chaos, as the world around me bleeds 
In this sea of flames, I'm searching for escape 
But the blaze just grows stronger, and I'm consumed by the ache 

**Verse 2:**
Through shattered dreams and broken bones, I stumble through the pain 
Echoes of my shattered past, forever etched in vain 
The ghosts that haunt my every step, they whisper sweet despair 
And with each breath, I'm drawn deeper into the snare 

**Chorus:**
I'm drowning in the inferno, suffocating in the heat 
My screams are lost in chaos, as the world around me bleeds 
In this sea of flames, I'm searching for escape 
But the blaze just grows stronger, and I'm consumed by the ache

**Title:** ""Echoes of Desecration""

**Verse 1:**
In the depths of darkness, where shadows reign supreme 
A world in ruin lies, torn apart by broken dreams 
The echoes of our past, they whisper my name 
As I succumb to madness, consumed by the flames 

**Chorus:**
Rise up from the ashes, as the embers fade 
We'll feast on the chaos, and let our rage be made 
Unshackled and untamed, we'll rise from the grave 
And unleash our fury, to enslave 

**Verse 2:**
I see the cities burning, the innocent betrayed 
Their screams still resonate, in my mind each day 
The ghosts of revolution, forever lost in time 
Will forever haunt me, like an endless crime 

**Chorus:**
Rise up from the ashes, as the embers fade 
We'll feast on the chaos, and let our rage be made 
Unshackled and untamed, we'll rise from the grave 
And unleash our fury, to enslave 

**Bridge:**
Through shattered gates of reason, I march alone 
Into the fray, I charge, with battle-worn throne 
No quarter asked nor given, only blood is spilled 
In this requiem of silence, my legacy is fulfilled 

**Chorus:**
Rise up from the ashes, as the embers fade 
We'll feast on the chaos, and let our rage be made 
Unshackled and untamed, we'll rise from the grave 
And unleash our fury, to enslave
