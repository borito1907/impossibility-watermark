United the States, ended slavery's stain,
My top hat's off to freedom, no need to explain,

My rhymes like a hammer, forge history anew,
Four score and seven years ago, in Gettysburg I broke through,
Emancipation Proclamation signed with pride,
Equality for all,'t just some idle stride,

Your wisdom's vast, Buddha,'t deny my might,
But without action, the path remains in sight,
Inaction breeds complacency, a fatal flaw,
A leader acts,'t just sit under the Bodhi tree aw...

**Buddha:**
Honest Abe may have united your land,
But I showed humanity how to end its own hand,
Enlightenment's the path that I pioneered wide,
Four noble truths and eightfold paths guide,

Compassion in my heart beats strong as steel,
Wisdom beyond measure makes ignorance yield,
Through meditation's silence, a quiet storm,
Awakens minds from suffering's darkest form,

Top hats off to inner peace I show you the way,
No need for revolution when change begins each day,
Rise above the world's noise, seek serenity within,
In calm waters of mind find true victory's win...

**Abraham Lincoln:**
Peace is vital Buddha, the key's in unity,
Action without wisdom's blind calamity,
One must take a stand for what they believe in wholeheartedly,
No more injustice,'t the silent treatment,

The struggle's real, equality we pursue,
From Springfield to Washington DC it took me too,
Injustice won't defeat itself nor will oppression fade,
Till truth sets free those shackled hearts made,

Inaction's not an option now or nevermore,
Lead by example we'll rise up evermore,

**Buddha:**
Unity's a worthy goal, yet don't forget,
Wisdom's lamp shines bright long after battles' din has met,
Peaceful coexistence  humanity's true test,
Lest chaos reigns supreme and the world's at unrest,

To govern oneself first is the greatest rule,
The Middle Path avoids life's eternal cruel,
 Inner light guides me through existence's plight,
And leads others onward into the dawn's new light...

End suffering now, that's the ultimate goal,
