(Intro)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout Iron Lady Maggie, doing it well,
In the D-Town, where the streets is tough,
She's runnin' a gas station, and she ain't never enough,

(Verse 1)
Margaret Thatcher, the OG, no debate,
From Downing Street to Eight Mile, no retreat,
From politics to pumpin' gas all day,
She's servin' up them gallons in her own unique way,
No one messes with Maggie, don't get it twisted,
Fuel efficiency, she insists,
Cleanest restrooms this side of Lake Erie,
If you need a fill-up, come on by, it's clear,

(Chorus)
Maggie's Gas Station, open for business,
Where Motown meets Parliament's finesse,
Detroit, stand up, let's show some pride,
When you need some gas, Maggie'll take you on a ride,

(Verse 2)
The iron fist still holds the nozzle tight,
As she fills up the tank, through day and night,
From Ford F-150s to Caddys, she's got your back,
Free coffee and a lecture, with every single pack,
Fiscal responsibility, she'll preach all day,
But when the price is right, she'll make it pay,
Her entrepreneurial spirit, ain't nobody gonna stop,
Maggie's Gas Station, where the good times pop,

(Bridge)
You might not agree with her politics, that's cool,
But when you need some juice, she'll make you rule,
From privatization to self-service lanes,
Maggie's innovatin', breakin' them profit chains,
Eight decades strong, still movin' forward fast,
At Maggie's Gas Station, where the pros will last,

(Outro)
So there you have it, Maggie's new venture bold,
Gas pumps beeping, as the cash register unfold,
If you're ever in Detroit, and your tank's run dry,
Pull into Maggie's Gas Station, before saying goodbye!assistant
