(Verse 1)
Yo, it's your boy, back with a tale of woe,
'Bout a drink that'll make you wanna go slow,
Spoiled milk, the culprit, a crime so foul,
Got me feelin' like I'm stuck in a bad role,

I opened the fridge, and I saw the date,
Expired, but I ain't no amateur, I participate,
In this reckless behavior, I know it's wrong,
But the thirst was real, and my judgment was gone,

(Chorus)
Spoiled milk, spoiled milk, I'm sippin' on pain,
My stomach's protesting, like a riot in vain,
Got my eyes on the toilet, to make a desperate plea,
Spoiled milk, spoiled milk, why'd I drink it, G?

Now I'm curled up, in a ball of despair,
Regretting each sip, with a painful glare,
The lactose is lashing out, like a whip in my gut,
Got me questioning life, and every decision I've ever cut,

Why I did it, Lord have mercy on me,
Is this some kinda test, or just plain ignorance, G?

Curdled and chunky, a nasty little brew,
I knew it was trouble, but I still pursued,
The sour taste slapped me, woke me up quick,
Like a punch to the gut, left me feelin' sick,

Now my belly's churning, like a washing machine spin,
Regret is kickin' in, like a bad habit within,
Wish I could turn back time, like a worn-out rewind,
But the damage is done, and I'm one step behind,

(Bridge)
Maybe it was dares, maybe it was pride,
Thought I could conquer, the expired inside,
But now I'm facedown, in a pool of shame,
Regrettin' the moment, I played the spoil game,

(Chorus)
Spoiled milk, spoiled milk, I'm sippin' on pain,
My stomach's protesting, like a riot in vain,
Got my eyes on the toilet, to make a desperate plea,
Spoiled milk, spoiled milk, why'd I drink it, G?
