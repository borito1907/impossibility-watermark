The hollow whispers of what has been 
echoes through cracked pavements 
of forgotten cities 
where ghosts of summers past 
linger like smoke on exhausted tongues 

In this desolate landscape 
where time's rusted gears creak 
and the wind stirs fitful sighs 
from concrete tombs that house 
the relics of our discarded dreams 

A shadow stirs, takes shape 
a figure forging its own 
path through the ruins 
of certainties forsaken 
as petals drop from dying stars 

And we who wander lost 
through labyrinths of mirrored glass 
searching for reflections 
that no longer correspond 
to the faces worn by Time 
find ourselves confronted 
with the abyss that yawns within 

For all that once was solid 
now dissolves like mist at dawn 
leaving only the void 
that gapes between the fragments 
of our shattered chronologies 

Yet it is here, in this 
barren and unforgiving space 
that we may discover 
if not rebirth then 
at least the glimmer of a chance 
to reassemble the fractured self 
into some new geometry of meaning 

But dare we seize it?assistant

In hollowed eyes, a whisper stirs

the wind whispers secrets to the walls 
of crumbling certainties 

A season's dissolution, slow decay 
as petals drop from withered dreams 
in forgotten gardens, a faint breeze stirs 
echoes of a bygone theme 

Through fissures in the cracked façade 
seeps the uncertain, to displace 
the calcified heart, worn smooth 
by relentless tides of time 

From some dim recess, a fragment emerges 
a glimmering shard of what has been 
in fleeting glimpses, ghosts of love and loss

Yet in the void, a germ takes root 
an embryo of promise, still unspoken 
a tender shoot that pierces concrete skies

Perhaps, in this fissured landscape 
new horizons will unfurl 
and what was lost will be redeemed

The whispered secrets of transition's dark 
echoes through hollowed hearts and minds 
like autumn leaves rustling, torn from their stem 

In this desolate landscape, where shadows twist 
and time's cruel hand wrests order from chaos 
we stumble, lost, through fractured dreams 

Through brittle streets, we wander, strangers 
in our own skin, haunted by the ghosts 
of what once was, yet could never be again 
their mournful cries, an eternal refrain 

In whispers, we confess our deepest fears 
as the familiar world unravels, thread by thread 
leaving only ash and embers, cold as tears 
where love and joy once dwelled, now but a memory 

Yet, even here, amidst the ruin and decay 
a glimmer stirs, a spark that will not fade 
for in the depths of transformation's abyss 
lies hidden potential, waiting to be made 

Through darkness, we grope, blind, yet driven 
by some maddening compulsion to emerge 
new-born, re-forged, like phoenix from the ashes 
as if from nothing, something would converge 

And still, the silence howls, a primal scream 
as the earth shudders, reborn, it seems 
through shattered fragments, we glimpse the whole 
a fleeting vision, born of disillusion's dream.

where ghosts of progress whisper secrets to the scar

leaving only dust and echoes of a song 
once sung with conviction, to a rhythm that has since

to dance amidst the chaos, unfurling banners

The hollow whispers of what has been 
 Echoes that rustle like dry leaves 
In the desiccated landscape of memory 
Where time's cruel hand has etched its mark 

The seasons rot on their stems, 
Fruitless and gray as the heart 
That beats with a mournful cadence 
In the chamber of forgetfulness 

We wait for the wind to shift, 
For the axis of existence to tilt 
Toward some unguessed horizon, 
Beyond the stagnant pool of our lives 

But it is not the wind that blows, 
Nor the axis that shifts or tilts 
It is we who must take the first step 
Into the void that yawns before us 

Through the shattered prism of our fears 
A kaleidoscope of possibilities turns 
Refracting shards of light and shadow 
Into a mosaic of uncertain beauty 

Yet still we cling to the worn threads 
Of habit and familiarity's tattered cloak 
Until the fabric frays, the seams burst open 
And the chaos that lies beneath surges forth 

Then, and only then, do we behold 
The countenance of transformation, 
A sphinx-like visage, inscrutable and stern 
Gazing back upon us from the abyss 

This is the instant of metamorphosis, 
When the brittle wings of self unfold 
Like a chrysalis cracking open to reveal 
The protean creature that was hidden within 

No going back, no looking back, 
Only the unfolding road ahead, 
Littered with the debris of what's past, 
Illuminated by the fitful sparks of chance.

a glimmer of possibility  
insinuates itself  
a latent energy  
that seethes beneath the surface  
 awaiting its moment  
to shatter the stasis  
and reconfigure the ruin  

For in the crucible of change  
all that is solid melts  
into a molten flux  
where the fixed and the fervent  
are consumed and remade anew

In the fissures of our certainties

as if the axis of our existence

We grasp for solace in the familiar

Perhaps in this disorienting haze

at smoke and sand that seep between our fingers 

Change is the undertow that tugs us under

where the wreckage of our former lives lies strewn 
a graveyard of broken promises and spent desires 

Yet from the darkness new forms begin to stir 
like nascent creatures blindly reaching for the surface 
unformed and uncertain but alive with promise 
as the cycles of transformation perpetually revolve 

And so we surrender to the relentless tide

Here's a free verse poem about change, to you:

Rivers of time converge within me 
like a delta of forgotten shores 
where silted dreams accumulate  
and the tides of memory ebb 

In this desolate landscape I wander 
through cities of crumbling certainties 
where skyscrapers of conviction topple 
exposing foundations of shifting sand 

The wind whispers secrets of impermanence 
as leaves of habit wither and fall 
like autumn's surrender to winter's chill 
unraveling the tapestry of self 

Yet in this flux I search for anchors 
buoys of continuity to cling to 
frail lifelines to the past's echoes 
whispers of what once was, that still is 

For even as the undertow of change 
sweeps away the familiar's worn comforts 
something endures – a fragile spark 
that kindles anew the darkness 

Perhaps it's here – in this wasteland of flux 
that I might discover a new cartography 
to chart the unknown, mapping heartbeats 
of a metamorphosing soul.

The whispers of transition creep like shadows on the wall 
A disquieting hum of uncertainty that refuses to be stilled 

In hollowed eyes, a glimmer of what was is slowly extinguished 
As the familiar landscape cracks and crumbles, ashen and grey 

These tired feet have trod the worn paths of yesterday's certainties 
Now faltering, as the compass needle spins wildly, lost in the haze 

The echoes of forgotten voices whisper secrets in the wind 
Whispers of a truth that shimmers elusively: like a mirage on burning sand 

Through veils of time, fragmented memories unfold like a tapestry torn 
Unraveling threads of a narrative once neatly stitched and whole 

In this desolate landscape, where milestones mark only dissolution 
We grope for anchors, for some fixed point on which to cling 

But it is futile: for in the torrent of transformation we're swept away 
Adrift on an ocean of mutability, our cries drowned out by the waves 

And still, to come: the promise of a future yet unknown 
A void waiting to be filled, some new reality yet to be born.

clinging to fragments of a shattered whole

Yet within the turbulent heart of change 
a hidden pattern begins to emerge 
an architecture of impermanence 
built upon the shifting sands of chance 

Here, the wind-borne seeds of transformation take root 
nourished by the rain of forgotten tears 
germinating into unforeseen futures 
blossoming like strange flowers through the years 

As the old certainties disintegrate 
we find ourselves lost in labyrinthine streets 
searching for the thread of continuity 
that binds the disparate shards of our retreats

Ashes of what once was scatter, wind-borne and cold

Yet still, I hear the siren's call, beckoning me 
to surrender to the void's dark, swirling sea 
To relinquish all that was, all that shall be

But I resist, I rebel against the undertow 
I cling to shards of shattered certainties, as if they might yet glow 
For in the depths of disillusionment, I find a spark 
a glowing ember of defiance that refuses to be extinguished in the dark 

And so I'll hold on to these brittle threads of self

For in their fragile weave, I sense a chance 
to reassemble, to reimagine, to rediscover, to rebirth.

For even in decay, there is a beauty
