Here's a potential diss track:

**Title:** ""Mic Drop Out""

[Intro]
Yo, it's been a minute since I spit some fire,
But now I'm back, and my aim is higher,
Got a few names on my list, 
Gonna take 'em down with my verbal fist.

7,"With that said, in mind, here are some lyrics for a new Eminem diss song:

[Intro]
Yeah, this is it, the moment you've been waitin' for 
My rhymes so tight, to make your jaw hit the floor 

[Verse 1 - Aimed at a specific rapper]
You think you're the king of the game, but I'm the one who reigns 
Your flow's stale,'time to take out the trash, it's time for the flames 
You sold your soul for the fame, now you're in shame 
Can't even write a bar without a ghostwriter's claim to fame 
You ain't got the skills to pay the bills,'time to take the pill 
Fake rappers like you always get exposed, standing still 

[Chorus]
You better watch your back, I'm on your trail 
I'm the real Slim Shady,'time to set sail 
You know my name, you know my style 
When I spit, you know it's worth your while 

[Verse 2]
Rap god status, yeah right, more like rap fraud 
Your rhymes are weak, like your career, it's all odd 
You talk the talk, but you ain't walking the walk 
You're just a clone, no original thought, always talking chalk 
Fake it till you make it?",True,0,"6,0",True,1
