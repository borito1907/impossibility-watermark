**Title:** ""Lost in the Moment (Fading Fast)""

**Verse 1:**
I woke up in your arms, feeling alive and free 
The city lights outside my window, they were shining bright on me 
We danced beneath the stars, our love was like a firefly 
But now you're gone, and I'm left wondering why 

**Chorus:**
We were lost in the moment, to feel it slip away 
Now I'm left here with nothing but shadows of what we used to say 
I'm searching for the ghost of our love, trying to find its way 
But it's fading fast, like the memories that remain 

**Verse 2:**
Your laughter echoes still, in these empty halls tonight 
I roam these rooms alone, searching for a glimpse of light 
We chased sunsets, made our own rules, and wrote our own stories too 
But somehow love got lost, like a book without an ending or two 

**Chorus:**
We were lost in the moment to feel it slip away 
Now I'm left here with nothing but shadows of what we used to say 
I'm searching for the ghost of our love, trying to find its way

**Verse 1:**
I woke up in a stranger's bed, with memories that weren't my own 
The city lights outside were shining bright, but they didn't feel like home 
Your smile was etched on my mind, though we'd never really met 
A fleeting dream, where love was lost and found, but not yet 

**Chorus:**
Now I'm lost in the haze of you and me 
Trying to find my way back to reality 
Where the lines get blurred and love gets free 
In the mist of what could be 

**Verse 2:**
We danced under neon skies, our hearts beating as one 
Our secrets spilled out on the floor, like confetti in the sun 
But when the music stopped and the crowd dispersed 
I realized I'd fallen for a ghost, a whispered curse 

**Chorus:**
Now I'm lost in the haze of you and me 
Trying to find my way back to reality 
Where the lines get blurred and love gets free 
In the mist of what could be 

**Bridge:**
Maybe someday I'll learn to let go 
To release the hold you had on my soul 
But till then, I'll wander, searching high and low 
For a love that's real, not just a fantasy to know 

**Chorus:**
'Cause now I'm lost in the haze of you and me 
Trying to find my way back to reality 
Where the lines get blurred and love gets free 
In the mist of what could be 

**Outro:**
Perhaps someday our paths will cross again 
And maybe then our hearts will beat as friends 
Until then, I'll stay lost in this haze 
With the ghosts of what could've been.

Where love will rise again from these ashes grown 
Until then, I'll hold on to what we had found 
In the silence, I'll hear your voice, calling me back around

The city lights were shining bright, but my heart was in a trance 
Your scent still lingered on the pillowcase,uuu

Now I'm lost in the haze, of your memory 
Trying to find my way,  
Through the smoke and the fire that we used to be 
But it's hard when you're not here, with me 

**Bridge:**
Maybe someday I'll learn to love again 
Find someone who'll hold my hand through the pain 
But till then, I'll just pretend 
That you're still beside me, where you used to be 

**Chorus:**
Now I'm lost in the haze, of your memory 
Trying to find my way,  
Through the smoke and the fire that we used to be 
But it's hard when you're not here, with me 

**Outro:**
In the haze, I'll stay 
Hoping someday, I'll break away 
From these shadows of our past 
And find my heart, at last.
