In the velvet-draped hours,'the moon 
a ghostly florist, a bouquet 
of frost and smoke 

The wind whispers secrets 
to the shrouded trees 
and they lean in 
like conspirators 

Their branches like skeletal fingers 
pointing to the places 
where love has gone awry 

A lone streetlamp casts an amber glow 
over the deserted avenues 
where lovers once strolled 
hand in hand 

Now only shadows roam 
in search of solace 
or some fleeting thrill 

In this city of lost souls 
I'll wander 
searching for 
a glimpse of your face 

Or perhaps just the memory 
of your whispered promise 
that things would get better 

But until then I'm left 
to navigate these streets 
haunted by the ghosts 
of our fractured love 

And so I'll roam 
through the neon-lit nights 
guided by the faint hum 
of my breaking heart.

Here's a poem in the style of Richard Siken:

""In the Museum of Broken Things""

In the museum of broken things, I find myself 
A fractured exhibit, of splintered bone and skin 
Where shards of memories linger, of love that used to be 
A reliquary of what could never begin 

The curator of my heart, a meticulous collector 
of every shattered dream, every promise left to wither 
He polishes each fragment, to a mournful sheen 
So I may gaze upon the ruin, of all that might have been 

In the gallery of lost hours, where shadows roam 
I see your face reflected, like a ghostly echo home 
A fleeting glance that lingers, on the walls of my mind 
Like a whispered secret kept, by the silent and the blind 

The exit signs are faded now, the doors all closed 
Yet still I wander through these halls, forever lost 
Through rooms of longing, corridors of pain 
Where every step I take leads back to the same 

The museum of broken things, is open late tonight 
Admission is free, but at what cost, I pay the price 
For every memory recalled, another piece of me departs 
Leaving me a little less whole, with every shattered heart.

The moon a gilded razor cuts the night 
a silver scimitar that slices through 
the bruised and swollen petals of my soul 
leaving me a ravaged thing anew 

Your hands like winter branches bare 
reached out to grasp what was already lost 
and in their skeletal fingers I beheld 
the fossilized remains of all our costs 

Oh love we were a ruin from the start 
two crumbling spires that pierced the dark 
our kisses mere sparks that flew apart 
like embers from a dying pyre's heart 

Now in this desolate and lovely land 
I roam a specter searching for your hand 
through forests of glass where every tree 
is shattered beauty broken perfectlyassistant

where shadows writhe like addicts craving their next fix 
The rain, a mourner's veil that shrouds the streets 
as I recite the litany of our defeat 

Your name, a cicatrix on my tongue 
a wound that will not close 
In its ridged whorls, 'l hear whispers of the past 
when love was an act of self-immolation 

We were two arsonists who torched the night 
and danced among the embers of our desires 
Now only ash remains, a bitter residue 
that chafes my skin like a hair shirt 

Yet still I search for you in every stranger's face 
in alleys where the neon screams like a wounded thing 
Perhaps in some forgotten courtyard, we'll collide again 
and reignite the fire that consumed us both 

Or maybe I'm just lost, a pilgrim without a shrine 
haunted by the ghost of what could never be 
A love that was a crime scene, to which I return 
again, again, forever drawn.assistant

Amidst the cypress trees, the shadows cast their spell 
and ancient secrets wait to be unearthed from their cell

Like a lone wolf I'll prowl through the night's dark shade 
pursuing the ghosts of love and memory that have faded 
In moonlit gardens overgrown with weeds of old desire 
I'll search for fragments of a heart that's lost its fire

Oh, the beauty and the brutality that we conceal 
beneath the masks we wear the faces that we feel 
But in the silence of this haunted, and forsaken place 
perhaps the truth will whisper secrets to my face

Feasting on the fat of every spark  

In this derelict terrain I search  
For relics of a love that's lost its sheen  
A fossilized kiss petrified in time  
A promise hollow as a gourd  

The moon above a silver stain  
Casts an unsparing light on all my pain  
A merciful eclipse would be  
A respite from this lacerating beauty  

But still I'll hold on to these thorns  
These splinters of a love now torn  
For in their jagged contours I find  
A fleeting solace,.assistant

In the museum of broken things, I find myself 
lost among the shards of love and shattered wings 
The curator of heartache whispers secrets in my ear 
of all the ways we've failed to hold each other dear 

A diorama of dusty roses, the petals falling slow 
like autumn rain on forgotten graves 
I reach out to touch the glass, try to recall the sound 
of footsteps walking out, the creaking of the floorboards worn 

In vitrines of smoke and mirrors, I confront the ghosts 
who haunt me still, the ones I thought were lost 
Their eyes like lanterns flickering bright with every lie 
every promise made in fervent whispers through the night 

In this hall of fractured dreams, I search for clues 
for reasons why we couldn't make it through 
The exhibits blur, the labels fade, the stories untold 
but in the silence, I hear the echoes of our gold
