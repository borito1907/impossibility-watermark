Through darkness, darkness takes flight.

Here is a new poem I came up with:


""Moonlit Dreams""

In silver light, where shadows play,
The moon's soft whisper beckons me away,
From worldly cares and noise and strife,
To a realm of dreams, of endless life.

Where stars and darkness reign supreme,
And the world's din and chaos cease,
I find my heart and soul take flight,
In the moon's silvery,  gentle light.
