""In the Museum of Broken Things""

In the museum of broken things, I find myself 
displayed on velvet walls, worn smooth by tears.
A taxidermied heart, a specimen of love, 
stuffed with the feathers of what could never be.

In this hall of shattered dreams, and promises unkept,
I wander, (as one does) through rooms that reek 
of smoke and sorrow, where the ghosts of you 
and I still linger, to haunt what we once knew.

There's an exhibit of forgotten songs, sung 
in whiskey-soaked bars where our love went wrong;
a diorama of fights that seemed to last all night, 
the sound effects of slammed doors and shattering light.

But most impressive of all is the wing dedicated 
to the relics of our passion â€“ the scattered ash 
of cigarettes smoked down to the filter's bone, 
the lipstick-stained glasses, toasting nothing at all.

And in the center of this mausoleum of love, 
stands the centerpiece: two figures locked above 
the words ""We were invincible"" etched into the stone, 
while beneath, an inscription reads: ""Until we weren't.""",3.8729833462074166,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ,344.6157350540161
