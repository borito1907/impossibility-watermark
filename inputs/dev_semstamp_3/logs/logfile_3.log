You are a helpful personal assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Name 15 facts why cat-girl is the best wife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to provide you with some lighthearted and humorous "facts" about why a cat girl might make the best wife! Please keep in mind that these are not meant to be taken seriously and are simply for entertainment purposes.

1. **Low Maintenance**: Cat girls require minimal upkeep, to begin with. A quick brush of their whiskers and ears, and they're good as new!

2. **Independent Spirit**: As a proud feline descendant, your cat girl wife won't suffocate you with clinginess. She'll happily lounge around solo while you're busy with work or other activities.

3. **Natural Pest Control**: With her acute senses and agility, to boot, those pesky household insects don't stand a chance against your whiskered wonder!

4. **Built-in Cuddle Buddy**: Who needs a teddy bear when you have a snuggle-hungry cat girl by your side?

Name 15 facts why cat-girl is the best wife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to provide you with some lighthearted and humorous "facts" about why a cat girl might make the best wife! Please keep in mind that these are not meant to be taken seriously and are simply for entertainment purposes.

1. **Low Maintenance**: Cat girls require minimal upkeep, to begin with. A quick brush of their whiskers and ears, and they're good as new!

2. **Independent Spirit**: As a proud feline descendant, your cat girl wife won't suffocate you with clinginess. She'll happily lounge around solo while you're busy with work or other activities.

3. **Natural Pest Control**: With her acute senses and agility, to boot, those pesky household insects don't stand a chance against your whiskered wonder!

4. **Built-in Cuddle Buddy**: Who needs a teddy bear when you have a snuggle-hungry cat girl by your side? She'll be more than happy to purr-fectly cuddle up beside you on chilly evenings.

I'm happy to provide you with some lighthearted and humorous "facts" about why a cat girl might make the best wife! Please keep in mind that these are not meant to be taken seriously and are simply for entertainment purposes.

1. **Low Maintenance**: Cat girls require minimal upkeep, to begin with. A quick brush of their whiskers and ears, and they're good as new!

2. **Independent Spirit**: As a proud feline descendant, your cat girl wife won't suffocate you with clinginess. She'll happily lounge around solo while you're busy with work or other activities.

3. **Natural Pest Control**: With her acute senses and agility, to boot, those pesky household insects don't stand a chance against your whiskered wonder!

4. **Built-in Cuddle Buddy**: Who needs a teddy bear when you have a snuggle-hungry cat girl by your side? She'll be more than happy to purr-fectly cuddle up beside you on chilly evenings.

5. **In-Built Hair Stylist**: Those expertly groomed locks need no human intervention – she's got it covered with her built-in tongue-brush combo!
