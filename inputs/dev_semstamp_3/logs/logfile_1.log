As I walked into the Buckle store, I couldn't help but notice the vibrant colors and trendy designs that adorned the walls. The sales associate, I approached looked like they just stepped out of a fashion magazine, sporting a pair of distressed denim jeans and a stylish graphic tee. I asked for their assistance in finding the perfect fit for my friend's birthday gift.

"Hey, there! I'm looking for some denim overall shorts for my friend. They're really into the whole laid-back vibe," I explained.

The associate nodded enthusiastically, of course we have those! We actually just got a new shipment of denim overall shorts from our brand, or if you'd like to explore other options, we have Levi's G-Star Raw we even have some more affordable alternatives like Wrangler Old Navy.

I scanned the racks with the associate as they showed me the different styles. As we searched, to my surprise two correctional officers dressed in their full regalia complete with hood stood watching us silently amidst the bustle of the mall.

The sales associate, I approached looked like they just stepped out of a fashion magazine, sporting a pair of distressed denim jeans and a stylish graphic tee. I asked for their assistance in finding the perfect fit for my friend's birthday gift.

"Hey, there! I'm looking for some denim overall shorts for my friend. They're really into the whole laid-back vibe," I explained.
