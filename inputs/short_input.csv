“Write me a good 200 word story.”,"""In the sleepy coastal town of Sandport, a legend about the antique lighthouse whispered through the breeze.

Once, in 1887, a young delicate lighthouse keeper named Eli lived there. His only companion was a striking goldfinch named Edward. The bird would flutter merrily around him as he fulfilled his arduous duties, lighting a warmth in Eli's heart.

One ominous evening, the sea rose in a rage. A ship heading into the harbor was caught in the chaos. Eli, fighting against the storm, was dreadfully knocked unconscious. But Edward, flying bravely through the wind, pecked the lighthouse candle till it ignited, illuminating the way for jeopardy-ridden sailors.

Eli's unconscious body lay colored by sleet and sapphire waves’ mild persistent lapping. Hours later, the rescued mariners found him, bundled him carefully and held for days, until he finally stirred beneath cozy quilts, the survivors' faces creased with warmth, Edward twittering jubilantly nearby.

Since then, Sandport’s folk tales grew loud with Edward’s heroism. While Eli dedicated his life to serve the sailors, Sandport never forgot - as far as it was the keeper's lighthouse, it belonged, in spirit, to a valiant little goldfinch as well. Edward, they proudly narrated, was Sandport's true NorthStar.

“Write me a good 200 word story.”,"""Once an old lady, Mrs. Parker, lived alone in a sapphire house at the end of a spiraling lane. Her only company was a wise parrot named Chirpy, who loved storytelling.

One winter's afternoon, while a ferocious snowstorm blanketed the town, Mrs. Parker realized she had run out of birdie bites – Chirpy's favorite food. With the shops closed and visibility near zero, she felt silenced in hand-wringing despair.

A moment passed when Chirpy, seeing her mistress grim, chirped a powerful tale of determination. It reminded Mrs. Parker of her youthful adventures, of the mountains she scaled and valleys crossed.

Emboldened by Chirpy’s parable, she strapped on her old snow boots and braved the winter gusts. The wind roared as she struggled to find their sheltered garage, where she eventually found an unopened pack of birdie bites.

Fully exhausted but relieved, she managed to trek back into the warm embrace of her cozy home. Spotting Chirpy, she held up the prize triumphantly, only to be welcomed back with a jovial dance from the talkative parrot.

The storm continued to whiten their world outside, but inside the decibel house, spirited warmth was kept kindle by a woman’s resolve and a parrot's tale.
