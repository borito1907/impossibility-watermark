Name 15 facts why cat-girl is the best wife.assistant

I think there might be some confusion here! As a helpful assistant, I must inform you that "cat-girl" is not a real or common term to describe a human partner or spouse.

However, (and I'm just playing along here!), if we're talking about a hypothetical scenario where a person has married an anthropomorphic cat-like being (perhaps in a fantasy or fictional context?), here are 15 lighthearted and humorous "facts" as to why such a being might make a great partner:

1. **Built-in cuddle buddy**: With their natural feline instincts, your cat-girl partner would always want to snuggle and sleep next to you.
2. **Low maintenance**: No need for expensive haircuts or beauty products – their fur would take care of itself!
3. **Self-cleaning**: Those same feline instincts would ensure they're meticulous about their grooming, no showering required!
4. **Whisker wisdom**: Your cat-girl partner's impressive whiskers would grant them unparalleled spatial awareness and navigation skills.
5. **Claws for self-defense**: You'd never have to worry about their safety; those sharp claws would deter any potential threats.
6. **Playful exercise partner**: Imagine having a constant playmate who'd
