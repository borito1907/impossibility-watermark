Find all solutions for 2 sin(x) = √(2), where x is between 0 and 2πassistant

A nice trigonometry problem!

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine function:

2sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2
sin(x) = √(1/2)
sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we need to find the angles x such that sine of x is equal to 1/√2.

We know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so one solution is:

x = π/4

However, sine is positive in the first two quadrants (0 to π), so we also have:

x = 2π - π/4
x = 7π/4

These are the two solutions within the interval [0, 2π].

So, the final answers are:

x = π/4 and x = 7π/4assistant
