Give a detailed description of the character River Wyles from To the Moonassistant

River Wyles is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists in the 2020 indie adventure game To the Moon, developed by Freebird Games. She is a complex and intriguing individual with a rich backstory that slowly unravels throughout the course of the game.

**Physical Appearance:** River is depicted as a young girl with short, curly brown hair and big, expressive green eyes. Her facial features are delicate, and she has a petite build. In the flashbacks and memories explored during the game, her age ranges from around 6 to 14 years old.

**Personality:** River's personality is multifaceted and revealed through various conversations, to her journals, and interactions with Johnny (the protagonist). At times, she comes across as energetic, curious, and playful, but also struggles with anger issues, fear, and vulnerability. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that she has experienced significant emotional pain and turmoil due to her troubled past.

**Background:** River's life was marked by difficulties and abandonment issues. Her parents were neglectful and often absent, leaving her feeling unloved and alone. This led to deep-seated insecurities and a desperate need for attention and validation. Despite these challenges, River developed a strong bond with Johnny, who became her closest friend and confidant.

**Relationship with Johnny:** The relationship between River and Johnny serves as a central theme in To the Moon. Through their interactions, it becomes apparent that River sees Johnny as a source of comfort, trust, and security - all things lacking in her own childhood. Johnny's presence in her life brings a sense of balance and happiness, which she desperately clings to. Their connection is built on empathy, shared experiences, and understanding, ultimately shaping both characters significantly.

Throughout the game, as Johnny's story intertwines with River's memories, the complexity of their bond and its profound impact on both characters become increasingly clear.assistant
