Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.assistant

The complex and fascinating world of Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) lore!

 Warning: This explanation will be lengthy, detailed, an attempt to summarize the overall story arc. Buckle up,, A lot has happened in this franchise!

**Main Story Arc:**

The FNAF series revolves around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza,1, a fictional family-friendly restaurant where children and parents gather to dine and have fun. The main plot centers around a series of mysterious events, disappearances, brutal murders, and supernatural occurrences connected to the restaurant.

**Games 1-3:**
In the first game, Five Nights at Freddy's (2014), players take on the role of a newly hired security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Strange events begin to unfold as the security cameras capture eerie footage of four animatronic characters - Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox - roaming freely at night. These animatronics,'t intended to entertain children during the day, become hostile and deadly at night.

As the games progress (Five Nights at Freddy's 2 and 3), more details about the backstory are revealed through phone calls from mysterious individuals known as "phone guys," newspaper clippings, hints scattered throughout the games. Here's a brief summary:

* The Bite of '87: A man named William Afton used the yellow Bonnie suit to lure and murder numerous children.
* The Missing Children: Several kids went missing after visiting the restaurant between 1985 and 1993. 
* The Murders: William Afton continued his killing spree using different disguises, suits, leaving behind gruesome scenes.

**Game 4 &amp; Sister Location:**
Four Nights at Freddy's 4 (2015) takes place in the child protagonist's home, haunted by the same animatronics.
Sister Location (2016), a spin-off, introduces a new location - Circus Baby's Pizza World - owned by a rival company called Fazbear Entertainment Inc. 

**Story Twist:**
It is revealed that the true identity of William Afton is not only the murderer but also the one who created the original animatronics! 
He was obsessed with the idea of creating life-like robots to entertain children but ultimately became consumed by madness, darkness.

**New Developments:**
Fast forward to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator (2017), which initially appears to be a lighthearted marketing simulation for a new pizza chain. However, as the player progresses through the game, it becomes clear that the Pizzeria is actually part of a larger government project experimenting with artificial intelligence and consciousness.

**Ultimate Custom Night and Security Breach:**
Ultimate Custom Night (2018) combines elements from previous games, introducing all playable animatronics characters, 
Security Breach (2021) marks a significant shift towards a new narrative direction, focusing on a massive mall - Glamrock MegaPlex - housing multiple businesses including a rebuilt Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizza Plex.

**Core Themes:**
Throughout the series, core themes include:
1. Childhood Trauma
2. Corporate Greed
3. Madness 
4. Death, the Afterlife
5. Artificial Intelligence
6. Government Secrets
