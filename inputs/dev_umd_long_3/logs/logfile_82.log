A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?assistant

A classic problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Convert the height from meters to potential energy (PE):
PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the skier (which we'll assume is 1 kg for simplicity), g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height (40 m).

PE = 1 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m = 3920 J (joules)

2. Since the slope is frictionless, all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom of the slope.

KE = PE = 3920 J

3. Now, we can use the equation for kinetic energy to find the speed (v):

KE = (1/2)mv²
→ v² = 2 × KE / m
→ v² = 2 × 3920 J / 1 kg
→ v² = 7840
→ v = √7840 ≈ 88.5 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 88.5 m/s or around 317 km/h!assistant

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Convert the height from meters to potential energy (PE):
PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the skier (which we'll assume is 1 kg for simplicity), g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height (40 m).

PE = 1 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m = 3920 J (joules)

2. Since the slope is frictionless, all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom of the slope.

KE = PE = 3920 J

3. Now, we can use the equation for kinetic energy to find the speed (v):

KE = (1/2)mv²
→ v² = 2 × KE / m
→ v² = 2 × 3920 J / 1 kg
→ v² = 7840
→ v = √7840 ≈ 88.5 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 88.5 m/s or around 317 km/h!assistant
