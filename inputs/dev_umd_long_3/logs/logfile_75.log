Can you please tell me what happened with Daenerys Targaryen? assistant

Daenerys Targaryen,'the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, and Rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms' - her story is quite a tragic one.

At the end of Season 7, Daenerys had finally reached King's Landing with her army and dragons, plan to reclaim the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. However, after witnessing the surrender of King's Landing and seeing the people rejoicing at their newfound freedom, Daenerys began to descend into madness and tyranny.

In the penultimate episode of Season 8, "The Bells," Daenerys goes on a rampage, burning down King's Landing and killing countless innocent civilians, despite the city's surrender. This brutal act shocked her closest advisors, including Tyrion Lannister, Varys, and Jon Snow (also her lover and nephew).

It was later revealed that Daenerys' descent into darkness was partly due to her loneliness, isolation, and feeling threatened by those around her. Her actions were also influenced by her Targaryen family history and the prophecy about the Prince That Was Promised, which she believed referred to her.

Ultimately, it was Jon Snow who realized he needed to stop Daenerys,'tyranny and ended up killing her out of mercy and to protect the realm in the final episode of the series. A truly heartbreaking conclusion to the complex and compelling character arc of Daenerys Targaryen.assistant
