﻿﻿Write me a 12 quastion that most asked when ever read debate, script, book or read anything in general assistant

Here are 12 common questions that people often ask when reading a debate script, book, or any written material:

1. **What is the main idea or thesis of this text?**
	* Understanding the central argument or claim being made is crucial to grasping the content.

2. **Who is the intended audience for this piece?**
	* Knowing who the author is trying to reach helps readers understand the tone, language, and perspective used.

3. **What is the author's purpose or goal in writing this?**
	* Is the author trying to persuade, inform, entertain, or educate?

4. **What are the key terms or definitions I need to understand?**
	* Unfamiliar vocabulary can be a barrier to comprehension; identifying important terms helps readers move forward.

5. **How does the author structure their argument or presentation?**
	* Understanding the organizational approach (e.g., chronological, cause-and-effect, compare-and-contrast) helps readers follow along.

6. **What evidence or supporting details does the author provide?**
	* Identifying the types of evidence (e.g., statistics, anecdotes, expert opinions) helps readers evaluate the author's claims.

7. **Are there any assumptions or biases present in the text?**
	* Recognizing potential biases or unstated assumptions allows readers to think more critically about the material.

8. **How does the author address counterarguments or opposing viewpoints?**
	* Seeing how an author responds to alternative perspectives helps readers assess the strength of their argument.

9. **What are the implications or consequences of the author's ideas?**
	* Considering the potential real-world effects of an author's suggestions helps readers appreciate the significance of the topic.

10. **Can I summarize the main points or takeaways from this text?**
	* Being able to condense complex information into concise, essential points demonstrates understanding.

11. **Are there any areas where I disagree with the author or would like more information?**
	* Engaging critically with the material by formulating questions or challenges shows active engagement and deeper thinking.

12. **What actions or changes would I like to make as a result of reading this?**
	* Reflecting on how the material might influence one's thoughts, behaviors, or decisions reveals its impact and relevance.

These questions can help guide your own critical thinking and reflection as you engage with written materials!assistant
