The mystical unicorn mare brought forth a silver chalice and dipped it into the mirror-like pond before her.assistant

What a breathtakingly magical scene you're describing! It sounds like something out of a fantasy novel or a dreamscape.

To help build upon this enchanting moment, of the mystical unicorn mare dipping the silver chalice into the mirror-like pond, (which I imagine is reflecting the beauty of its surroundings), here's a possible next sentence:

As she raised the chalice to her lips, in a gesture both reverent and mysterious,, the surface of the pond began to ripple softly, with an otherworldly energy emanating from the depths within.
