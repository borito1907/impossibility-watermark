What is the Resource Interchange File frmat?assistant

The Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is a type of file format used to store metadata and resources, such as images, audio, and videos. It was developed by Microsoft and IBM in the early 1990s.

RIFF files contain a series of chunks,assistant

The Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is a type of file format used to store metadata and resources, such as images, audio, and videos. It was developed by Microsoft and IBM in the early 1990s.

RIFF files contain a series of chunks, each identified by a unique identifier called a "Four Character Code" (FOURCC). These chunks can store various types of data, including:

1. Image and video data: RIFF is often used to store bitmap images, animated GIFs, and AVI videos.
2. Audio data: RIFF is used to store audio data in formats like WAV and ACM.
3. Metadata: RIFF files can store metadata about the resources they contain, such as author information, timestamps, and copyright notices.

Some common examples of file formats that use RIFF include:

*.AVI (Audio Video Interleave)
*.WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)
*.BMP (Bitmap image file)
*.RMI (Resource Metering Information)

Overall, the RIFF format provides a flexible way to store and manage multimedia resources and their associated metadata.assistant
