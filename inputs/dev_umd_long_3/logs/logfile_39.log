write a rap song about Ethereum and a stolen chocolate chip cookie named Bradleyassistant

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell
'Bout a crypto king, and a snack that fell
Ethereum's the name, decentralized fame
But Bradley's the cookie,'taken in shame

Ain't no blockchain gonna get it back
My sweet tooth's on high alert attack
Got my eyes on the prize, but it's gone astray
Bradley, you thief, you stole it today

(Chorus)
Ethereum's on the rise
Gas prices ain't no surprise
But Bradley, you sly cookie crook
Gimme back my treat, or you'll face the hook!

(Verse 2)
Smart contracts on the chain
But Bradley's got a cravin' for my sweet domain
ERC-20 tokens, can't buy me peace
Not with my boy Bradley, makin' off with ease

Private keys, ain't no match
For this cookie fiend, and his sticky snatch
I deployed my code, with precision fine
But Bradley's got the goods, and he's one of a kind

(Bridge)
Open source, and open hearts
But when it comes to cookies, we draw our parts
GitHub's where the magic's made
But Bradley's gotta own up, what he's played

(Verse 3)
Solidity's where I reside
But Bradley's got the skills, and my snack inside
Decentralized dreams, on hold
Till I reclaim Bradley, that's what I'm told

Transaction hash, won't clear the air
Till Bradley confesses, without a single care
In this Web3 world, where freedom reigns
Gimme back my cookie, Bradley, or you're outta bounds, mate!

(Outro)
So listen up, Bradley,'thief
Return the cookie, or Ethereum's relief
We'll put it all behind, like a bad block
And get back to buildin', when you cough up the knock!assistant
