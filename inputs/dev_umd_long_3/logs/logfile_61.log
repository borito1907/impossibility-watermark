Who invented Zinc suncreen?assistant

Zinc oxide,'t be attributed to a single inventor of sunscreen. However, (at least), I can provide some information on the history of zinc oxide and its use in sunscreens.

Zinc oxide has been used for centuries,, with ancient Greeks and Romans using it as a topical ointment to treat skin conditions. In the late 19th century,'t begin to gain popularity as an ingredient in skincare products.

One of the early pioneers in the development of modern sunscreens was a chemist named Milton Blake. In the 1920s, Blake developed a proprietary formula that included zinc oxide as an active ingredient. His company, The Blake Company, marketed this product as a "sunburn cream" intended to prevent sun damage.

However,'t until the mid-20th century that zinc oxide started being widely used as a UV protector in commercial sunscreens. In the 1950s and 1960s, several companies began incorporating zinc oxide into their sunscreen formulations.

The first broad-spectrum sunscreen containing zinc oxide is often credited to a scientist named Franz Greiter, who developed a product called "Grecian Gold" in the 1970s. Greiter's formulation combined zinc oxide with other ingredients to provide protection against both UVA and UVB rays.

While it isn't possible to attribute the invention of zinc sunscreen to a single person, these individuals played significant roles in popularizing the use of zinc oxide as a key ingredient in sunscreens.assistant
