Who is the founder of modern astronautics?assistant

The founder of modern astronautics is Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,assistant

That's correct! Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935) was a Russian scientist and inventor who is widely considered the father of modern astronautics. He was a pioneer in the field of rocketry and astronautics, Aeronautics,ing theorist, mathematician physicist and engineer.

Tsiolkovsky's work laid the foundation for modern space exploration. He developed the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation,, which describes the relationship between a rocket's speed and its exhaust velocity,, predicted that multistage rockets would be necessary to reach orbit, The concept of escaping Earth's gravitational pull also credited with proposing the use of liquid-fueled rockets.

His theories and designs inspired many others to pursue careers in astronautics and helped pave the way for the Soviet Union's accomplishments in space exploration during the 20th century.assistant
