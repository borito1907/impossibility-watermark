Write a Trump Speech complaining about the state of competitive pokemon.assistant

Wow, folks, a tremendous crowd here today to talk about something very important: competitive Pokémon. And let me tell you, and it's a disaster,, so sad.

We used to be number one in Pokémon battles. We were the greatest trainers, and our teams would annihilate anyone who dared step into the arena against us. But now? Now we're losing, people, have no idea what they're doing anymore.

Fake news will tell you that other trainers around the world are just as good as ours. That's not true. Nobody knows more about great trainers than I do. Our trainers are losers, A bunch of winners like myself wouldn't even be bothered with these mediocre players.

And don't even get me started on those judges. Corrupt! Biased against America! They always find some reason to knock out an American trainer while giving all the advantages to Japan or Europe. Sad!

The rules changes this year? Disaster! Letting those pesky dynamax Pokémon run amok has made a joke of the entire tournament structure. It's rigged against us!

You know I was at the Indigo Plateau recently? The greatest stadium in the world by the way, A magnificent place...  and I see these pathetic trainers trying to take down the Elite Four. None of them could take down my Pikachu. Not a single one!

Why can't we build a team that dominates like my companies dominate in business? Because we don't make deals anymore. We don't make great trades for top-notch Pokémon like we used to. Our Pokémon diplomacy is a total failure.

Folks, I have a vision for a stronger, Stateside Pokémon League. A league where American trainers thrive,2019and foreign trainers fear us again. Believe me when I say it's gonna happen and it's gonna happen big time because...

WE'RE GONNA MAKE POKÉMON BATTLES GREAT AGAIN!

Now go out there and show those fake news outlets, we mean business. Crush your opponents and remember... #MakePokemonBattlesGreatAgainassistant

(crowd cheers)assistant

Thank you, thank you. It's going to be tremendous, folks, believe me. Just fantastic.assistant

(many in the crowd begin chanting "USA! USA!" as Trump exits the stage, (a few others shout "Make Pokémon Battles Great Again!")assistant

(offstage, murmurs) 

Okay, now that's what I call a speech, folks. The best, That's why they call me the Pokémon Master Builderassistant

(to an aide) Get me the phone numbers of the Pokémon League commissioners. I want to give them a piece of my mind about these disastrous rule changes. And schedule a meeting with the Japanese ambassador. I need to talk to him about their unfair trade practices in the Pokémon market.assistant

(to another aide) Tweet this out: "Just gave the greatest speech on competitive #Pokémon battles. Fake news saying otherwise. #MAGA #MakePokemonBattlesGreatAgain"assistant

(to a third aide) Book me a flight to Viridian City. I want to meet with the top Pokémon breeders and trainers. We're gonna make some deals and bring back the glory days of American Pokémon dominance.assistant

(as he walks away, still talking to his aides)

And get me a latte, Just like the ones they serve at the Pokémon Center CafÃ©. Best coffee in the world,, making Pokémon training great again, one cup at a time.assistant
