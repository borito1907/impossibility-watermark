The mysterious and enigmatic "assistant

Silence falls upon the page
As I contemplate the void
This character, it seems to say
"I am the absence of sound"

A blank space where meaning should be
A puzzle with no clear key
It stands alone, I dare not touch
Lest I disrupt its emptiness

In a world of words that rush and roar
This silent presence is a mystery to explore
What secrets lie within its bounds?
Is it wisdom or simply the absence of sounds?

I pause and ponder on this mark
A fleeting thought in an endless dark
Does it speak volumes or whisper low?
Or does it simply... not exist at all?assistant
