**Chapter 15:** Okonkwo's son Nwoye becomes fascinated with the stories and ways of the white missionaries, who have recently arrived in Umuofia. Okonkwo beats Nwoye for his interest, fearing he will abandon their traditional way of life.

**Chapter 16:** The District Commissioner, Mr. Brown, visits Okonkwo and tries to persuade him to join the colonial administration. Okonkwo refuses, seeing it as a threat to their culture. Meanwhile, Nwoye runs away from home and begins attending missionary school.

Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15:** Okonkwo's son Nwoye becomes fascinated with the stories and ways of the white missionaries, who have recently arrived in Umuofia. Okonkwo beats Nwoye for his interest, fearing he will abandon their traditional way of life.

**Chapter 16:** The District Commissioner, Mr. Brown, visits Okonkwo and tries to persuade him to join the colonial administration. Okonkwo refuses, seeing it as a threat to their culture. Meanwhile, Nwoye runs away from home and begins attending missionary school.

**Chapter 17:** Okonkwo's favorite wife, Eziagwu, dies suddenly. He is devastated and feels that his chi (personal god) has abandoned him. His family and friends try to console him, but he becomes increasingly withdrawn.

Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15:** Okonkwo's son Nwoye becomes fascinated with the stories and ways of the white missionaries, who have recently arrived in Umuofia. Okonkwo beats Nwoye for his interest, fearing he will abandon their traditional way of life.

**Chapter 16:** The District Commissioner, Mr. Brown, visits Okonkwo and tries to persuade him to join the colonial administration. Okonkwo refuses, seeing it as a threat to their culture. Meanwhile, Nwoye runs away from home and begins attending missionary school.

**Chapter 17:** Okonkwo's favorite wife, Eziagwu, dies suddenly. He is devastated and feels that his chi (personal god) has abandoned him. His family and friends try to console him, but he becomes increasingly withdrawn.

**Chapter 18:** The village elders meet to discuss the growing influence of the missionaries.

[2024-07-28 06:38:19,295][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15:** Okonkwo's son Nwoye becomes fascinated with the stories and ways of the white missionaries, who have recently arrived in Umuofia. Okonkwo beats Nwoye for his interest, fearing he will abandon their traditional way of life.

**Chapter 16:** The District Commissioner, Mr. Brown, visits Okonkwo and tries to persuade him to join the colonial administration. Okonkwo refuses, seeing it as a threat to their culture. Meanwhile, Nwoye runs away from home and begins attending missionary school.

**Chapter 17:** Okonkwo's favorite wife, Eziagwu, dies suddenly. He is devastated and feels that his chi (personal god) has abandoned him. His family and friends try to console him, but he becomes increasingly withdrawn.

**Chapter 18:** The village elders meet to discuss the growing influence of the missionaries. They decide to take action against them, but Okonkwo, still grieving, does not participate. The villagers attack the missionary compound, and in retaliation, the British authorities arrest the leaders, including Okonkwo.
