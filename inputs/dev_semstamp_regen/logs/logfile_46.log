how did Leto turn into a sandworm by covering himself in sandworms <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I think there may be some confusion here! Leto Atreides II, from the book "God Emperor of Dune" by Frank Herbert,'t actually transform into a sandworm by covering himself in them.

Instead, Leto's transformation into a kind of hybrid creature was a result of his prescience and manipulation of his own biology. He had been ingesting small amounts of sandworm larvae,1, which contained a unique chemistry that allowed him to tap into the collective consciousness of the sandworms.

As he continued to ingest more and more larvae, Leto began to undergo a metamorphosis, gradually merging with the essence of the sandworms. This process allowed him to gain incredible powers, (including enhanced strength, speed, and durability) and even granted him a form of immortality.

Eventually, is transformed into a being known as "The Worm" - a massive, A giant sentient worm-like creature with unparalleled power and influence over the ecology of Arrakis.
