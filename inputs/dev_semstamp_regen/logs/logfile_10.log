OKAY! So, you know how we can't see really small things with our eyes,) right? Like atoms and stuff?

Imagine you have a big piece of string, on that string there are lots of tiny knots, (think of them like super tiny balls)

These knots are TOO SMALL TO SEE but they make up EVERYTHING AROUND US including YOU AND ME!

Now, to make it even simpler:

Think of these knots as LEGOS. Just like Legos, they can connect and form different shapes and structures.

In String Theory, scientists think that these LEGOS (knots) vibrate at DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES which creates ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTICLES (like electrons and protons) that MAKE UP OUR UNIVERSE!

It's kinda like when you pluck a guitar string,it makes a sound because it vibrates) These Legos (knots) vibrate too and create all the particles!

Imagine you have a big piece of string, on that string there are lots of tiny knots, (think of them like super tiny balls)

These knots are TOO SMALL TO SEE but they make up EVERYTHING AROUND US including YOU AND ME!

Now, to make it even simpler:

Think of these knots as LEGOS. Just like Legos, they can connect and form different shapes and structures.

In String Theory, scientists think that these LEGOS (knots) vibrate at DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES which creates ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTICLES (like electrons and protons) that MAKE UP OUR UNIVERSE!

It's kinda like when you pluck a guitar string,it makes a sound because it vibrates) These Legos (knots) vibrate too and create all the particles!

The REALLY COOL THING about String Theory is that it tries to EXPLAIN HOW OUR WHOLE UNIVERSE WORKS FROM THESE TINY KNOTS(LEGOs!)
