What is the price of natural gas for consumers in Qatar?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

In Qatar, a country with one of the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, the government subsidizes the cost of natural gas for its citizens and residents.

As of 2022, the prices of natural gas for consumers in Qatar are as follows:

* For Qatari citizens:
	+ Residential areas: QR 0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or approximately USD 0.0137 per kWh.
	+ Commercial areas: QR 0.10 per kWh or approximately USD 0.0274 per kWh.
* For expatriates and non-Qatari residents:
	+ Residential areas: QR 0.20 per kWh or approximately USD 0.0548 per kWh.
	+ Commercial areas: QR 0.30 per kWh or approximately USD 0.0822 per kWh.

Please note that these rates are subject to change and might vary depending on individual circumstances. It's always best to check with the relevant authorities or your local utility provider for the most up-to-date information.

What is the price of natural gas for consumers in Qatar?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

In Qatar, a country with one of the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, the government subsidizes the cost of natural gas for its citizens and residents.

As of 2022, the prices of natural gas for consumers in Qatar are as follows:

* For Qatari citizens:
	+ Residential areas: QR 0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or approximately USD 0.0137 per kWh.
	+ Commercial areas: QR 0.10 per kWh or approximately USD 0.0274 per kWh.
* For expatriates and non-Qatari residents:
	+ Residential areas: QR 0.20 per kWh or approximately USD 0.0548 per kWh.
	+ Commercial areas: QR 0.30 per kWh or approximately USD 0.0822 per kWh.

Please note that these rates are subject to change and might vary depending on individual circumstances. It's always best to check with the relevant authorities or your local utility provider for the most up-to-date information.
