70," Let's use Equation 1:

5x + 6(6) = 61

Simplify:
5x + 36 = 61

Subtract 36 from both sides:
5x = 25

Divide by 5:
x = 25 / 5 = 5

So, x = 5 and y = 6!assistant

To summarize:

The values of x and y are:

x = 5 
y = 6 

These values satisfy both equations: 5x + 6y = 61 and -3x + 9y = 39.assistant
