Here is a non-rhyming poem about darkness:

Darkness falls, like a veil of shadow 
A silence that blankets the world 
It creeps in, not with a sound 
But with an unsettling stillness 

In its depths, stars twinkle like diamonds 
Flickers of light in an endless expanse 
Yet even their radiance cannot dispel 
The crushing weight of this empty space 

In the darkness, fears come alive 
Monsters lurk, to pounce and devour 
But it's also where dreams take flight 
Where the unknown beckons, in whispers and shadows 

So let us not fear the dark of night 
For within its mystery lies our own strengthassistant
