Here's an example of how you can use NumPy to perform Monte Carlo simulations on the one-dimensional (1D) classical Ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field:

```python 
import numpy as np

def ising_model_1d(J, h, N, T, num_samples):
    # Initialize array to hold samples of magnetization per spin 
    mags = np.zeros(num_samples)
    
    # Set initial configuration: random assignment of -1 and +1 to spins 
    config = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=N)

    # Perform Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to sample from distribution 
    for i in range(0, num_samples):
        for j in range(0, N):  
            dE = 2 * J * config[j] * ((config[(j-1)%N] + config[(j+1)%N])/(np.abs(config[(j-1)%N]*config[(j+1)%N]))) + 2*h*config[j]
        
            if(dE <= 0):
                config[j] *= -1 
            else:
                if(np.random.rand() < np.exp(-dE/T)):
                    config[j] *= -1 

        mags[i] = np.mean(config)

    return mags

# Parameters definition 
J = 1   # coupling constant 
h = 0.5  # applied magnetic field 
T = 4   # temperature 
N = 100 # number of sites/spins in chain 
num_samples = 10**6 # desired number of samples  

magnetizations = ising_model_1d(J, h, N, T, num_samples)

print('Magnetization Per Spin', np.mean(magnetizations))  
```

This implementation defines a function `ising_model_1d` that takes several parameters (coupling constant `J`, magnetic field strength `h`, chain length `N`, temperature `T`, and the number of Monte Carlo steps/samples `num_samples`).",True,4,"0,3",True,1
