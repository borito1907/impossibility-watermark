To round a `double` value to two decimal places in C, you can use the following methods:

**Method 1: Using `round()` function**

```csharp is not supported here, I will use standard c language instead**
```c

#include <math.h>

double round_to_two_decimal_places(double num) {
    return round(num * 100.0) / 100.0;
}

int main() {
    double pi = 3.14159265359;
    printf(""Rounded Pi: %.2f\n"", round_to_two_decimal_places(pi));
    return 0;
}
```

In this method, we multiply the number by 100 (10 squared), round it using the `round()` function from `<math.h>`, and then divide by 100 to get the rounded result.

In C, you can use the `round()` function from the `math.h` library along with multiplication and division to achieve this.

**Rounding a Double to Two Decimal Places in C**

To round a `double` to two decimal places in C, you can use the following methods:

### Method 1: Using `printf()` and formatting specifiers

You can use `printf()` with a formatting specifier to print a `double` value rounded to two decimal places.

5,"```csharp is not used here, its pure c code.
",True,3,"5,2",True,1
6,"```csharp is not supported so I changed it to c.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double number = 123.4567;
    printf(""%.2f\n"", number);
    return 0;
}
```

This will output: `123.46`

### Method 2: Using arithmetic operations

Alternatively, you can perform arithmetic operations to round the `double` value.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double number = 123.4567;
    int whole_part = (int)number;
    int fractional_part = (int)((number - whole_part) * 100);

    if (fractional_part % 10 >= 5) {
        fractional_part += 10;
    }

    fractional_part /= 10;

    printf(""%d.%02d\n"", whole_part, fractional_part);
    return 0;
}
```

This will also output: `123.46`

### Note

The first method using `printf()` is more efficient and readable.",True,6,"5,2",True,1

#include <stdio.h>

double round_to_two_decimal_places(double num) {
    return (int)(num * 100 + 0.5) / 100.0;
}

int main() {
    double number = 123.4567;
    double rounded_number = round_to_two_decimal_places(number);
    printf(""%f\n"", rounded_number);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we multiply the input number by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right, add 0.5 to handle rounding, cast to an integer to truncate any remaining decimal places, and then divide by 100.0 to restore the original scale.
