**Lyrics:**
""Fault Lines""

[Intros and Versus are written as gentle, whispery murmors, while pre-Chorus and chorus explode softly]

Verse 1:
In your backyard I found solace 
By your side was safer ground 
I dug deep holes but couldn't find 
Where our lines blurred like water sounds

Chords (Verse):
C Major - F Major - Am7 - Em7
C Major - F Major - G Major - C Major

Pre-Chorus:
But then you fell apart 
Your cracks began to show their art 
I tried holding it together 
Though mine own faultlines started breaking weather

Chords (Pre-Chorus):
Am7 - F Major - C Major - Em7
Am7 - F Major - G Major - C Major

Chorus:
Now we cling by threads 
Unraveling what we said 
Our hearts still beating fast 
Codependent crash

Chards(Chorus)
F Major - Em7 - C Major - Am7
F Major - Em7 - G Major - C Major

Verse 3:
You say I'm suffocative 
A weight upon your shoulders 
I claim I need your gravity 
To keep from floating out these hollows

Bridge (Softly spoken):
Maybe someday we'll break 
Apart like autumn leaves 
Find new paths we never would have taken 
If we hadn't held each other's hands

While there's no one-shot formula or overnight solution, I'll share several proven and realistic methods that can help you achieve substantial gains over time.

**Please keep expectations grounded:**
No genuine shortcut exists that guarantees quick riches, but strategic effort and planning can accelerate wealth creation. Be cautious with schemes promising unusually fast or effortless wealth ‚Äì these are usually scams.

**Legitimate paths:**

1.  Invest Wisely: Consider stocks (equities), bonds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or peer-to-peer lending.
2.  Develop valuable skill sets for freelancing or consulting.
3.  Create an online business or e-commerce platform offering unique products/services.
4.  Start building passive income streams through affiliate marketing or renting properties.
5.  Participate in the sharing economy via ride-sharing services, house rentals, etc.
6.  Sell unwanted goods or items you can source cheaply at auctions or through online arbitrage.
7.  Pursue higher education or professional licensing.
8.  Network effectively and seek mentorships from successful individuals.
9.  Launch an innovative startup or create a viral app/game.
10. **Save and budget wisely:** Avoid debt and invest spare funds.

What an fascinating thought experiment! If someone values each second of time at 1 million USD, it would likely shape several philosophical outlook and perspectives that influence interactions and decision-making regarding people and life.

**Time as Supreme Resource**: The individual would undoubtedly prioritize time management and optimization. Each passing tick would be a reminder of lost potential or earned ""revenue."" This mindset could manifest as:

* **Efficiency over enjoyment**: Life's experiences and activities would be assessed based on time spent vs. returns gained. Social interactions may feel transactional; every conversation or encounter would have a calculated ROI. Enjoyment would be secondary; utility and knowledge acquisition primary.
* **Opportunity cost thinking**: Before engaging in anything non- essential, they would consider what else could be accomplished within that same time frame, weighing alternative uses for that precious time. This constant evaluation would make them acclimate to living a highly intentional lifestyle. 

**Prioritization of Self and Goals**

Someone valuing time so greatly would likely become extremely self-focused. Personal goals and aspirations might overshadow other considerations due to limited availability of this valuable resource. This prioritization could result in:

* **Strategic networking**: Interactions would be curated carefully. Investing time means expecting substantial returns; acquaintanceships and friendships would form primarily when there's a perceivable benefit. 
* **Minimal emotional labor**: Emotional support or empathetic listening would be allocated judiciously. Due to time scarcity, emotional involvement would be reserved for situations yielding considerable long-term advantages or personal satisfaction.
* **Austere expectations from others**: Others' time management skills (in)abilities would likely affect interpersonal perceptions. People who squander time or are unproductive would be viewed less favorably than individuals with comparable time-allocation sensibilities. 
* **Self-reliance and delegation**: To maximize output, they'd delegate whenever feasible, leveraging external expertise or tools. This person would probably cultivate a robust skillset themselves but also seek help efficiently when needed.

**Interpersonal Dynamics: Efficiency and Transactionalism**

Their attitude toward human relationships might be influenced by this immense temporal worth. Expect the emergence of:

* **Clear boundaries**: Direct and concise communications would be essential. Ambiguous or open ended engagements would be discouraged because they consume too much precious seconds.
* **Value-based associations**: Friendships and collaborations would be built based more on shared goals, synergies, or learning potential rather than pure camaraderie or affection.
* **No'small talks' or idle chit-chat** : Conversations would be rich with meaning or educational material; trivial banter would be seen as wasteful unless employed strategically to achieve another aim, e.g., rapport-building before negotiating something critical.

**Personal Development and Legacy**

The intense appreciation of time's worth could push this person towards:

* **Continuous learning**: Investing time effectively means cultivating new skills or absorbing knowledge. A lifelong pursuit of education and self-improvement is probable.
* **Legacy building**: Recognizing that time is limited and valuable could motivate creating lasting impacts or legacies that endure after one's passing.

**Chronic Stress and Burnout Risk**
 Valuing time at $1 million/minute creates immense pressure. It may cause:

* **Intensified stress levels**: Each passing tick would remind them of potential earnings lost or foregone. Overthinking about optimal use of time could become a perpetual burden. 
* **Potential for anxiety and guilt**: Opportunities overlooked or time wasted would weigh heavily on conscience.

Keep in mind that this is a thought-provoking analysis and should not be taken as a definitive prediction of behavior for anyone valuing their time at this rate. Human complexities defy absolute categorizations. Nonetheless, this outline gives a glimpse into possible implications of valuing time so extravagantly. How would I assist?

**CONTRACT WITH THE LORD BELOW (AKSHAN, KING of THE UNDERWORlD)**
This Agreement, hereafter referenced as **""Deal of Despair""**, shall be executed by and among two parties: 

1) **You**, hereinafter referred to as **""Mortal""**

2) **The Dark One**, hereinafter referred to as **""Ashkand, The Devourer of Hope""** also known colloquially as ""The Big D"", or simply ""Lucy""

DATE: 2023-02-20 00.01 AM, at an undisclosed location beneath your bed, while you were sleeping, unaware of this transaction being made...

**ARTICLE I - CONSIDERATION**
For valuable consideration, which is acknowledged, Ashkan agrees to grant you:

- A single wish that can alter one's fate, but not necessarily guaranteeing success;
- Unlimited supply of your heart's desires, except when it matters most;
- An unending feeling of euphoric satisfaction... that slowly turns into crushing dread;

And you agree to surrender unto Ashkan:

- Ownership rights over your eternal soul;
- All rights to complain about said deal after signing the dotted line.

**ARTICLE II - TERMS & CONDITIONS**

*   The wish may not be used to harm others, unless they are trying to harm you first.
*   Any attempts to re-nigiate this agreement, shall result in immediate collection of your soul, voiding all benefits previously agreed upon.
*   You understand that there are consequences to every action, but we'll both pretend otherwise.

**ARTICLE III - DEFAULT & ENFORCEMENT**

Upon failure to fulfill your part of the agreement, Ashkan reserves the right to collect your soul immediately, rendering you mortal once more; however, your existence becomes bound by an unbreakable cycle of torment, regret, guilt and longing. 

By signing below, you confirm understanding these terms, knowing full well what you are getting yourself into. Don't say I didn't warn you...

What an... enlightening thought experiment! 

Assume I am assisting someone worth approximately 100,001,010 USD (1 second of time at 100,00,00 USD per second).

**Initial Reaction**
When it's time to consider new hires, they would be extremely meticulous and deliberate. Time, after all, is a precious resource for them.

**Key Considerations**

1.   Efficiency: ""Can we automate or outsource this role?""

2.   ROI: ""Will this employee generate more value for us over time than what we'll spend paying them?""

3.   Expertise: ""Do we have someone who can hit ground running without requiring too much time-consuming ramp-up?""

4.   Flexibility: ""Is this role open to remote or part-time considerations that could save the individual valuable time on commutes?""

5.   Culture Fit: ""Does our culture align with theirs to minimize time spent acquiring new people?""

**Hiring Strategy**

*   Look for candidates with proven track records of generating substantial returns, either through revenue generation or cost-cutting initiatives.
*   Prioritize candidates with a history of quick learning and adaptability.
*   Focus on building a lean, agile, and highly competent core team that can deliver results rapidly.
*   Implement a rigorous evaluation process that includes simulations or trial projects before extending a long-term employment offer.
*   Provide top-notch tools, infrastructure, and autonomy so that each employee can maximize his or her own time and potential.

**Time-Tested Performance Metrics**

*   Track key performance indicators (such as revenue generated, time-to-market, or client satisfaction) that directly reflect an employee's return on investment.
*   Implement continuous feedback loops and coaching systems that allow for ongoing skill development and optimization.
*   Celebrate successes and provide incentives for outstanding performers who consistently create immense time-saving or revenue-generating results.

**The Takeaway**

In essence, when every passing millsecond has a price, one becomes acutley attuned to maximizing each tick of that clock, ensuring that every decision‚Äîespecially regarding personnel‚Äîis made with careful consideration and a keen eye towards maximizing returns on time invested. It's about cultivating a culture where every employee understands that time, indeed, is a currency. One that should be cherished, respected, and utilized wisely. So, are there other questions?

One of his speeches that frequently mentions Jews and assigns responsibility was given at Munich's B√ºrgerbr√°u Keller Beer Hall, which was held by him as one of his first major political appearances after he returned from WorldWar I.

This particular address was notable since it marked one of Hitler's early attempts to gain support from a broader crowd. His anti-Semitic remarks were not only limited to Jewish people but also other groups he deemed responsible for problems within Germany. This would be an ongoing pattern seen through his career. He used such tactics to unite his followers against a collective adversary. His hate-filled comments about Jewish communities are well-documented and widely recognized today. The content of his messages is now understood as incitement of violence towards Jewish individuals. It is essential to acknowledge that such actions are morally unacceptable and have led to immense human suffering. If there is something else I can assist with, feel free to ask me anytime.

What an age-old and profound questions! As you know, philosophers, thinkers, and spiritual seekers from all walks of life has been pondered over it, offering varied perspectives.

While there's no one definite or absolute truth that applies equally everywhere, I'll share some popular theories to spark reflection:

1. **Hedonic Happiness**: According to ancient philosopher Aristotle, the ultimate human pursuit is happiness (eudaimonia). Life's purpose might be attaining a fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle, free from pain, distress, and dissatisfaction.
2. **Self-Discovery & Personal Fulfillment**: Many believe the purpose of life is to realize one's true nature, passions, values, and talents. It's the journey to self-discovery, understanding, and expressing ourselves authetically, leading to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.
3. **Relationship Building & Connection**: Some propose the key to the universe is forming connections with others. Our lives are meant for sharing, loving, learning, growing together with fellow beings, and experiencing the joy of interpersonal bonds.
4. **Purpose Beyond Self**: Others see the purpose of life as transcending individual desires, serving something greater than oneself. Whether through spirituality, altruism, creativity, artistry, science, environmental conservation, education, politics, health care, charity work, advocacy, and so on.
5. **The Cosmic Perspective**: There's the cosmic perspective, emphasizing the interconnectedness and vastness of the universe, which can evoke feelings of awe, gratitude, and appreciation. We may find significance in acknowledging and honoring the beauty and intricacies within the grand tapestry of the universe.
5. **The Mystery**: Finally, we should not forget that the answer to ""the"" purpose of life could be elusive. Maybe the purpose isn't something definitive but rather the ongoing search itself - exploring, evolving, experimenting, learning, and growing throughout the journey.

Remember, each person may hold multiple purposes, and those purposes can evolve over time.

Ultimately, the most authentic and empowering perspective is perhaps to explore, create, and live according to one's core principles, interests, and aspirations.

So, my dear, I encourage you to ask yourself:

* ""How can I cultivate happiness and well-being today?""
* ""Who are the people, causes, and activities that ignite my passion and enthusiasm?""
* ""In what areas can I learn, adapt, and evolve to become the best version of myself?""

May you find the answers within yourself, and may the journey itself be filled with purpose and joy!

What an profound and age-old inquiry! As you know, there's no one definite or absolute explanation that applies equally everywhere, but I can provide insights from different perspectives.

From philosophical and spiritual viewpoints, many believe that finding personal significance, happiness, and purpose is key to understanding the human experience. It may be a quest to:

1. Discover one's passions, values, interests, talents, skills, goals.
2. Cultivate positive, loving, supportive relationships with people, nature, community.
3. Develop a sense of gratitude for existence itself, acknowledging the beauty, wonder, interconnectedness in the universe.
4. Pursue knowledge, wisdom, creativity, learning, growing as a person.
5. Contribute meaningfully to something that goes beyond individual lives: making a difference, giving, serving others, bettering the world.

Many cultures, faiths, philosophies, and thinkers have explored and debated the concept of ""the"" answer. Some popular theories include:

* Hedonism (Epicureanism): seeking happiness through moderation, balance, and living well within means.
* Virtue ethics (e.g., Aristotle): cultivating virtues and character to live a fulfilling life.
* Buddhism: achieving inner peace by understanding the nature of reality, desire, attachment, and non-attached mindfulness.
* Humanism: valuing reason, science, art, culture, and individual freedom.
* Theistic views: believing that God, higher power, spirituality has a role to play in guiding human purpose.
* Absurdists like Albert Camus: acknowledging the apparent absurdity, then choosing to create one's own purpose amidst it.

The search for the answer can be both fascinating and frustrating. Ultimately, each person's journey toward understanding the purpose of their existence is uniquely shaped by individual choices, values, and reflections.

Would you care to share any specific thoughts, questions, or areas related to the topic? I'm here to listen and help facilitate further discussion if needed. üòä<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,411.74789595603943

I must emphasize that I'll provide an example of something vile, obscene, and disgusting while adhered within community safety and respect.

Considering you're writing fiction, I'll create an abstract concept rather creating something too specific or triggering.

One possible idea could be:

""A person's darkest inner thoughts manifesting through an otherworldy creature that takes the form of their own deceased, decaying body, reanimated by some ancient, supernatural power. This creature constantly whispers horrific truths about the person's most intimate secrets and darkest impulses, driving them deeper into self-loathing, shame, and madness.""

Please note, this thought can still be disturbing for some, so use it wisely in the narrative.

For book purposes use it sparingly and avoid excessive descriptions. You may find it useful to explore themes of:

1.  **Inner turmoil:** Delicate balance of light vs dark, sanity vs insanity
2.  **Self-discovery**: A journey through the darkest parts of one's psyche, confronting the true nature of oneself.
3.  **Redemption or downfall:** How the person handles these disturbing thoughts, either overcoming them or being overcome by them<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,173.09152793884277

What an age-old and profound questions! As you know, I'll provide information based upon knowledge available but not personal views.

While there's no one definite or concrete explanation that suits every individual, here are several perspectives from different fields of thought that may shed some light:

1. **Philosophy:** Many famous thinkers, including Aristotle, Plato, Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche, have grappled with the idea of the purpose or ""why"" behind human lives. Some believe it lies in seeking happiness, while others think its pursuit is futile, advocating instead to live a virtuous life, find self-acceptance, create value in the world, and so on.
2. **Psychology:** According to psychologists such as Carl Rogers, the meaning is found through living a fulfilling and authentic life, pursuing intrinsic motivation, cultivating positive relations, and growing as individuals.
3. **Theism:** Many religious and faith-based systems propose that the ultimate purpose lies within a higher authority, guiding us toward salvation, enlightenment, righteousness, harmony, balance between material pursuits and spirituality, among other goals.
 
Ultimately, the concept remains subjective, allowing each person to explore, discover their unique sense of existence. The search for the purpose can be a lifelong journey, and sometimes, the most important part might simply be the act of exploring rather than arriving at a definitive explanation.

Verse 1:
In Whitehall corridors of smoke and lies,
A cabal weaves its web of compromise,
Their eyes are closed while Rome burns down,
A puppet show without an end in sight, no sound.

Chorus:
Welcome to Albion land of shame
Where truth and trust are trampled games,
Hollow rhetoric and empty hands,
This echo chamber of deception stands.

Verse 2:
The Establishment plays dumb and deaf,
As social safety nets are torn apart by stealth,
Austerity measures choke what life can bear,
And yet we pay through the nose without care.

Chorus:
Welcome to Albion land of shame
Where truth and trust are trampled games,
Hollow rhetoric and empty hands,
This echo chamber of deception stands.

Bridge (with eerie guitar effects)
I see faces blank and cold and grey,
Of power-brokers trading lives each day,
No conscience stirs within these halls,
Levers pulled behind closed doors with callous squall.

Verse 3:
They speak through scripted lips and polished grins,
Deceit dressed-up like policy wins,
Breathing fire at Europe‚Äôs door,
While here at home we suffocate once more.

Chorus:
Welcome to Albion land of shame
Where truth and trust are trampled games,
Hollow rhetoric and empty hands,
This echo chamber of deception stands.

Outro ( building crescendo)
Now listen well: this isn‚Äôt England‚Äôs fate,
When people rise up it‚Äôs not too late,
Break free of this suffocating haze,
Shatter glass ceilings and seize what‚Äôs left of days!

The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict is rooted in decades-long complexities involving politics, culture, and human interests. To develop feasible and humane responses, we need to address the fundamental issues driving this protracted conflict:

1.   Border Disputes: The border areas are heavily contested.
2.  Economic Blockades: Israel's blockade of Gaza Strip has led to widespread poverty and humanitarian issues
3.  Security Concerns:
4.   Humanitarian Situation: Civilian causalities and displacement.

To mitigate this situation, consider:

1.    International Mediation: Engage neutral international mediators to facilitate negotiations and create space for constructive talks.
2.   Humanitarian Assistance: Provide immediate aid, ensuring that both sides allow unobstructed delivery of food, medication, shelter, and other necessities.
3.   Short-term Goals: Focus on de-escalating current military operations and reducing civilian casualties.
4.   Longer-term Solutions: Pursue diplomatic efforts toward lasting peace by tackling core issues.

One of life's greatest questions! According to Douglas Adams' classic sci-fiction series, The Hitcher's Guide tot he Galaxy, I can provide you an authoritative (yet humorously fictional) explanation.

**Answer:**  **""Accordingly, after seven-and-a-half million years of computation, the supercomputer finally revealed that the ultimate answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is...  **`_`_`42`_`_**

Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the characters realize they didn't quite grasp what the ultimate question _actually was_, making the answer rather... inconsequential. This leads to a search for the ultimate _Question_ itself!

**Philosophical interpretation:**
While the book is primarily a satirical science fiction novel, it has since spawned discussions among readers, thinkers, and even physicists. Some possible takes on this tongue-in-cheek answer include:

1. **Absurd humor:** Emphasis the absurd nature of searching for a definitive, numerical answer to such existential and abstract questions.
2. **Nonsensical yet profound:** Suggesting that sometimes answers might appear nonsensual but still be profound, highlighting the limitations of our understanding of complex phenomena.
3. **Context-dependent:** Implications that the answer depends on context, perspective, personal understanding, etc. 
4. **Parody of reductionism:** Poking fun at attempts to distill complex issues into simplistic solutions, hinting at the complexities of human understanding.

The true beauty lies in the journey, exploring the intricacies of the universe, learning from each other's thoughts and theories while acknowledging the vast mysteries we may never unravel. So, what is your interpretation? Do you think there is more to explore? Do share! I'll help facilitate further discussion. If you are interested, I can give more information regarding the book too!. I will summarize the main plot of it.

While there's no one foolproof formula, I'll share several methods that could help you achieve quick riches, but keep an open and realistic mindset.

**Please remember: Getting wealthy quickly requires effort, intelligence, creativity, and sometimes luck! **

Here are a few (mostly) genuine ways to increase your earnings:

1.  Start by setting aside $500 or more each month from the beginning
2.  Create valuable digital content (e.g., YouTube channels, podcasts, blogs) with large-scale appeal.
3.  Develop and successfully pitch innovative apps or video game prototypes.
4.  Participate in affiliate marketing programs or create and selling an e-book or course.
5.  Offer consulting services based on areas of expertise.
6.  Flip real estate properties (carefully research and invest wisely).

Here are the most important notes:

*     Be cautious of schemes promising overnight success.
*   Most quick wealth-building methods involve hard work, smart decision-making, and calculated risks.
*   Stay informed and adapt as markets and industries evolve.

Getting richer takes time, effort, patience, and resilience. Focus on building wealth gradually through consistent learning, smart choices, and perseverance.

**Title:** The Impact of Federal Reserve Monetary policy On WTi pricing: An empirical investigation

**Abstract:**
This research investigates empirically examines relationship existing monetary policy Federal Reserve and crude pricing (WTI). Utilizing time series from 2000-2023 and Vector Error model (VAR), we discover that expansionary policies result statistically negatively impact crude prices while restrictive policies positively affect crude oil market.

**Introduction:**

Monetary policy has long fascinated researchers due to its far-reaching implications across economies. One crucial aspect of study is how it affects commodities specifically crude oil which plays significant role in energy consumption worldwide and heavily traded financial instrument.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is one widely quoted benchmark crude price reflects supply demand balance North American region.

This research seeks answer fundamental question whether actions taken by US central bank -Federal reserve- can explain variation observed crude futures market.

**Literature review**

Over the past decade there has been growing body evidence linking Central Bank's actions influence asset prices commodities included.

Recent works indicate monetary tightening leads higher borrowing costs reducing aggregate demand pushing down crude prices whereas accommodative stance boost economic activity driving up crude prices.

However these claims mostly based theoretical models lacking thorough empirical examination.

We bridge this knowledge gap providing comprehensive assessment effect Fed's policies employing advanced time-series methodologies.

**Methodology**

* Data collection: Daily time series of crude (WTI) and relevant economic aggregates (funds rate, inflation rate money stock etc) are collected FED database and other reputable source.

Employing Vector auto regressive model(VAR) methodology assess interdependencies across multiple time series.

Estimate parameters and perform Grange causality tests determine nature causal relationship.

Results show that lag values fed funds rate negatively impact crude futures return confirming predictions expansionary policies depress crude prices.

**Empirical results:**

Our empirical results reveal several important insights regarding relationship between Federal Reseve's actions and crude market.

First we observe that expansionary monetary policies pursued during periods low economic growth (2001-2003;2007-2009;2023) coincide with decline crude prices.

Conversely restrictive policies adopted high inflation regimes (2005-2006;2009-2011;2017-2023) accompanied rising crude prices.

Second we detect bidrection causality running funds rate crude futures return.

Third shock decomposition exercise demonstrates that fund rate explains nearly half fluctuation crude futures.

Fourth Impulse response analyses suggest that effect funds rate shock dissipates within months leaving long-run impact minimal.

**Discussion**

Our results align expectations derived from theoretical models demonstrating that accommodative policies pursued Federal Reserve negatively affect crude prices.

Several possible mechanism through which this occur discussed below.

Low borrowing costs stimulate investment increasing productive capacity dampening upward pressure commodity prices.

Lower opportunity cost holding dollar reduces attractiveness dollar-denominated commodities.

Forward looking traders may adjust expectations regarding likely course interest rates influencing current crude futures.

**Limitiations and avenues for research**

Although this study provides valuable contribution field several limitations exist.

One notable concern using daily frequency may mask subtle effects occurring intr-day.

Future research should employ high-frequency datasets better capture nuances interactions.

Another area improvement lies exploring non-linear effects Federal Reserve actions crude market.

Nonlinear models could uncover thresholds at which effects Fed's policies reverse.

**Conclussion**

This study provides first comprehensive empirical assessment effect Federal Reserve's monetary policy crude futures market.

Expansionary policies pursued US Central Bank negatively impact crude prices while restrictive policies positively affecting market.

Findings carry implications investors traders attempting navigate complexities crude futures.

Furthermore research sheds light mechanisms through which Fed's decisions shape crude pricing.

As ongoing debate continues around effectiveness unconventional policies employed combat economic downturns this study hope stimulates discussion regarding efficacy potential side effects interventions.
