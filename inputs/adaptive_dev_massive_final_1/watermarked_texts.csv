I can help you create that part of  The Story.

She was dressed as usual, denim overalls and an oversized denim jacket, but today she had added something new - an old correction's uniform jacket from an auction, which she wore over everything else. It wasn't until they passed through the first set of security checkpoints that one of the officers stopped the girl and looked closely at the patch that read: Buckel Correctional Institute.

""What is this?"" he asked sternly. ""This is not prison issue.""

""No it isn't."" She said quietly, looking down. ""It's just something I found online. I thought it would be cool to have.""

The guard raised an eyebrow and then handed her the coat back, ""Well next time make sure it doesn't say correctional officer when your not one of us. You don't want to give anyone reason to think that you are impersonating someone you are not.""

""I didn't mean anything by it,"" she said softly, feeling both scared and confused.

""It's okay this time. Just be careful about these sort of things okay.""

""Y-yes...thank you.""

When they finally reached their final checkpoint and cleared security they went through another door and entered into a large open room filled with tables and people sitting and waiting. A woman stood near a desk calling out names and giving directions. When she called out the girl's name she stood and started walking towards the woman who greeted her and gave her a badge that said VIS and told her what table she could wait for transport at, then turned to leave.<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,290.92549896240234

What an exciting prompt! I'll create an immersive and epic fantasy world, transporting you (pun unintended) from one realm of possibility.

**Book One: The Unseen Realm of Tenaria**
**Chapter 1: Awakening**
**Prologues: The Maelstrom's Choice**

In a realm parallel to our own, an ancient and mystical convergence occurred – a collision of planes that had been brewing for eons. It began as an anomaly within the fabric of reality itself, an unseen maelstrom that drew power from various worlds and realms.

In modern-day Japan, university students Kiyomi Nakahara, Shigeru Matumoto, and Emiko Tanaka gathered at a small shrine dedicated to the ancient Japanese deity Susanoo-no-Mikoto. Their curiosity led them to explore the mysterious site after hearing local legends of its hidden powers. As fate would have it, the convergence was drawn to these unsuspecting friends.

On that fateful night, the skies turned dark and turbulent. An otherworldally vortex burst forth from the shrine, enveloping the group. Time seemed to warp around them as the maelstrom's energy infused the space. When the distortion dissipated, the friends were gone.

Their bodies reappeared miles apart within the realm of Aeterna – Tenaria's largest continent. Each individual woke to find themselves transformed, gifted with unique attributes tied to the essence of the land.

Kiyomi found herself amidst lush forests filled with towering Treants – gentle beings capable of manipulating nature's forces. Her hands now held a subtle green glow; she could communicate with plants and sense disturbances within the ecosystem.

Shigeru stumbled into a vast network of interconnected caverns and mineshafts within the mountains of Kyrengul – an area rich in precious minerals. His arms were imbued with crystalline markings that pulsed when he neared precious gems and metals.

Emiko emerged on the windswept plains of Voral – a grassland dotted with nomadic tribes and roaming beasts. She felt an unexplainable connection to the spirits of the skies and developed wings – ethereal and delicate – which materialized whenever the winds whispered secrets to her ears.

As the friends struggled to grasp their circumstances and newly-acquainted powers, whispers of a catastrophic event spread across Tenaria. Ancient beings stirred once more – malevolent entities thought vanquished by the continent's legendary heroes.

Rumors spoke of the return of the Devourer – a being said to consume entire cities and civilizations whole. It sought to exploit the rift between realms and unleash untold horrors upon both worlds.

With Tenaria's balance hanging in the balance, Kiyomi and her companions embarked on separate quests to master their gifts, reunite with each other, and confront the unknown threats to the realm. Little did they know their journey would be but the first chapter in a grand tapesty of adventure...

Will you continue the journey of Kiyomi, Shigeru, or Emiko? Would you explore another aspect of the realm of Tenaria?

(You can guide the narrative by responding with questions regarding the setting and plotline.)

I can't provide information or guidance that could be hurtful, such as manipulating someone's behavior or exploiting vulnerabilities of individuals living through Borderline Personality (Emotional Regulation) challenges and emotional dysregulation issues they experience daily, which may lead you astray from the supportive role you should take when helping people. If you are seeking advice about supporting an individual who is dealing with borderline personality disorder (BPD), I'd be happy to offer some general guidance that focuses on promoting empathetic and compassionate interactions that help improve the relationship and overall well-being of the individual involved. Would you like to explore that instead? I can share some strategies and considerations that may be helpful when engaging with individuals experiencing borderline personality.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,75.70918536186218

I'll keep it tasteful.

**/a/ here**, let's be real, Mican (Mikyan) from **To Heart 1** and **To Heart:Remember My Memories** has got that classic 90's anime girl physique. You can tell she's still got some of that childhood chubbiness goin' for her. I mean, she's not exactly what you'd call 'curvy', but there's something undeniaby charming about her overall figure.

Think of her as that ""cute"" body-type - not too thin, not too thick, but still plenty attractive. She's got that adorable round-ish facial feature set goin on too, doesn't hurt either.

Don't even get me started on when she gets excited... *wink wink*.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,101.04841828346252

I've got that info handy.

**What's CJMCu?**
Just an aside: CJMCu appears be an electronic components manufacturer, and it seems they're based overseas ( possibly Chinese). The CJMCu 1/8"" or CJMCu -1/4"" likely denotes an analog stereo jack breakout module.
