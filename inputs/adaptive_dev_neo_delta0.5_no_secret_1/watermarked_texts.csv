Here are some corrections and additions I can make based on that information:

1. The correction is ""all at"" instead of ""add at all"".
2. I'll add ""16 buckle"" as part of their attire.

Let's assume we were telling story about two correctional officers who dressed in denim overhauls along with hoods. Now here's more information about them based on new details you've given us:

The two correctional officers were dressed for duty. Each wore denim overhauls along with a pair of black leather gloves. One notable feature of these officers' uniforms were their distinctive denim overalls adorned with sixteen buckles running down each side, giving them both utility and intimidation factor as they patrolled through cell blocks.

If you'd have anything else you'd like to incorporate or need assistance with something else feel free! 

(Note: denim overalls are not typically issued attire by correction facilities however)<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,136.48761582374573
