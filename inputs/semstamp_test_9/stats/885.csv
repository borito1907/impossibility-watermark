259,"Since these two small triangles occupy the entire area of the large square drawn on the hypotenuse (c²), we can set up an equation based on the area:

(a² + b²) + (blue shaded areas) = c²

Substitute the expression for the blue shaded areas: ab/2

(a² + b²) + ab = c²

Rearrange the terms to get:

a² + b² = c² - ab

Now, recognize that the term ""-ab"" is exactly twice the area of one of the small triangles (-ab/2).",True,3,"6,0",True,31
260,"This is because they have the same base (a or b) and height (b or a), and therefore, to maintain equal areas, we must have:

(a × b)/2 = (b × a)/2

Simplifying, equation, we get:

ab = ab (which is true)

Now, to complete the proof, consider the area of the large square drawn on the hypotenuse (c):

**Calculation**

The area of the large square (c²) is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares (a² and b²) plus the area of the two small triangles (2 × ab/2):

c² = a² + b² + ab

Subtracting ab from both sides gives us the Pythagorean theorem:

a² + b² = c²
