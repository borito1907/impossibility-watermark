",True,2,"5,2",True,22
60,"Let's use the following variables:

* m = mass of the skier (which we don't need to know, to find the speed)
* g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)
* h = height of the slope (40 m)
* v = velocity of the skier at the bottom (which we want to find)

We can use the equation for conservation of energy:

mgh = (1/2)mv²

where the left side represents the potential energy at the top (mgh), and the right side represents the kinetic energy at the bottom ((1/2)mv²).

64,"Let's use the following formula:

mgh = (1/2)mv^2

where:
- m is the mass of the skier (which cancels out on both sides)
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)
- h is the height of the slope (40 m)
- v is the velocity of the skier at the bottom (which we want to find)

Rearranging the formula to solve for v,2 gives us:

v^2 = 2gh

Plugging in the values, we get:

v^2 = 2 × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m ≈ 784 m²/s²

Taking the square root of both sides:

v ≈ √784 m²/s² ≈ 28.0 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the frictionless slope would be approximately 28.0 m/s or about 62.5 mph!assistant
