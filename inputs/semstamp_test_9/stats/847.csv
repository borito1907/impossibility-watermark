In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = -1.

x = (-(3) ± √((3)² - 4(1)(-1))) / 2(1)
x = (-3 ± √(9 + 4)) / 2 
x = (-3 ± √13) / 2 

So, the solutions are:
x = 0 (from equation (1))
x = 1 (from equation (2))
x = (-3 + √13) / 2 (from equation (3))
x = (-3 - √13) / 2 (from equation (3))

Therefore, the four solutions to the given equation are:

x = 0, x = 1, x = (-3 + √13) / 2, and x = (-3 - √13) / 2.assistant

Let me break it down further for better understanding:



**Step 1: Factoring out the GCF**

The original equation is: x⁴ + 2x³ - 4x² + x = 0

The greatest common factor (GCF) of all terms is x. So, we can factor out x:

x(x³ + 2x² - 4x + 1) = 0



**Step 2: Factoring the quadratic expression**

Now, let's focus on the expression inside the parentheses: x³ + 2x² - 4x + 1

We can factor this further into:

(x - 1)(x² + 3x - 1) = 0

So, our updated equation becomes:

x((x - 1)(x² + 3x - 1)) = 0



**Step 3: Setting each factor equal to 0 and solving**

We have three factors: x, (x - 1), and (x² + 3x - 1).",True,7,"6,2",False,34
87,"x = 0... (1)
or (x - 1) = 0 --> x = 1... (2)
or (x² + 3x - 1) = 0... (3)

Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation (3).

To solve this, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = -1.

x = (-3 ± √(9 + 4)) / 2 
x = (-3 ± √13) / 2 

So, we have two more solutions:
x = (-3 + √13) / 2... (4)
and x = (-3 - √13) / 2... (5)

Therefore, we have found five distinct roots of the equation:

x = 0, 1, (-3 + √13) / 2, (-3 - √13) / 2

Let me reorganize the steps to make it clearer:


**Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF)**


The GCF of all terms is x, so we can rewrite the equation as:


x(x³ + 2x² - 4x + 1) = 0


**Step 2: Solve for x = 0**


One obvious solution is when x = 0:


x = 0


**Step 3: Factor the remaining quadratic expression**


The quadratic expression inside the parentheses can be factored further:


(x - 1)(x² + 3x - 1) = 0


**Step 4: Solve for the first factor**


Set the first factor equal to 0:


x - 1 = 0


Solve for x:


x = 1


**Step 5: Solve for the second factor**


The second factor is a quadratic equation:


x² + 3x - 1 = 0


Factor it further:


(x + 4)(x - 1/4) = 0


**Step 6: Solve for the two factors**


Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:


x + 4 = 0 --> x = -4


x - 1/4 = 0 --> x = 1/4


**Final Solutions**


We have found four distinct solutions:


x = 0, x = 1, x = -4, and x = 1/4


These are the roots of the original equation x⁴ + 2x³ - 4x² + x = 0.assistant

Let me reformat the steps for better readability:


**Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF)**

The GCF of all terms is `x`. So, we factor it out:

`x(x³ + 2x² - 4x + 1) = 0`


**Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression**

Now, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:

`x((x - 1)(x² + 3x - 1)) = 0`


**Step 3: Solve for x**

Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x.
