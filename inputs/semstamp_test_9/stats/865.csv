Let's solve for k:

a³ + b³ + c³ = k

We'll find all possible combinations of a, b, and c that satisfy this equation for the first 100 values of k.

Here are the solutions:

k = 1: 
(a, b, c) = (0, 0, 1)

k = 2: 
No solution found

k = 3: 
(a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1)

k = 4: 
No solution found

k = 5: 
No solution found

k = 6: 
(a, b, c) = (1, 2, 1)

k = 7:
