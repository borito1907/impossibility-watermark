To calculate 31 × 12, I'll break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Multiply 30 by 12 (since 31 is close to 30)
30 × 12 = 360

Step 2: Multiply 1 by 12 (since we need to add 1 more group of 12)
1 × 12 = 12

Step 3: Add the results from Steps 1 and 2 to get the final answer:
360 + 12 = 372

Therefore, 31 × 12 = 372!assistant
