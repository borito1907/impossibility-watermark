So, the derivative of `(x+1)/(x-1)` is `-2/(x-1)^2`.assistant

It was my pleasure assisting you with differentiating the expression `(x+1)/(x-1)`.",True,7,"6,3",True,49
101," Let's find their derivatives:

`u'(x) = d(x+1)/dx = 1`
`v'(x) = d(x-1)/dx = 1`

Now, apply the quotient rule:

`(d/dx)[(x+1)/(x-1)] = ((x-1)*1 - (x+1)*1) / (x-1)^2`

Simplify the numerator:

`= (-2) / (x-1)^2`

So, the derivative of `(x+1)/(x-1)` is `-2 / (x-1)^2`.assistant
