Now, let's calculate the time it takes for light to travel this distance:

Time = Distance / Speed of Light 
= 5,900,000,000,000 m / (299,792,458 m/s) 
≈ 19,740 seconds 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

19,740 s ÷ 60 = 329 minutes 

Finally, there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:

329 minutes ÷ 60 = 5.48 hours 

So, it would take approximately **5 hours and 29 minutes** for light to travel from Earth to Pluto.

Plugging in the numbers:

Time = 5,900,000,000 km / (299,792,458 m/s)

Time ≈ 19.78 minutes

So, it would take approximately 19 minutes and 47 seconds for light to travel from Earth to Pluto.",True,7,"6,0",True,48
156,"Time = Distance / Speed

 Plug in the numbers:

Time = 5,900,000,000 km / (299,792,458 m/s)

To make the calculation easier, let's convert the distance from kilometers to meters: 

5,900,000,000 km × (1000 m/km) = 5,900,000,000,000 m

Now, plug it back into the equation:

Time = 5,900,000,000,000 m / (299,792,458 m/s)

Time ≈ 20 minutes and 45 seconds

So, it would take light approximately 20 minutes and 45 seconds to travel from the Earth to Pluto!assistant

157,"Time = Distance / Speed

First, convert the distance from kilometers to meters: 
5,900,000,000 km × 1000 m/km = 5,900,000,000,000 m

Now, plug in the values:
Time = 5,900,000,000,000 m / (299,792,458 m/s)

Time ≈ 19,734 seconds

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:
Time ≈ 19,734 s ÷ 60 = 329 minutes

Finally, there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:
Time ≈ 329 min ÷ 60 = 5.48 hours

So, it would take approximately 5 hours and 29 minutes for light to travel from Earth to Pluto.assistant

I see you want me to elaborate on that answer!
