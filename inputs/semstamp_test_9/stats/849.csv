Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), can be synthesized through a simple and well-known process called the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.

",True,7,"7,2",True,3
4,"Here's the step-by-step synthesis pathway:

**Reaction 1: Salicylic Acid Production**

* Start with phenol (C₆H₅OH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
* React them together at high temperatures (>100°C) to form salicylic acid (C₇H₆O₃) and water:
C₆H₅OH + NaOH → C₇H₆O₃ + H₂O

**Reaction 2: Acetylation of Salicylic Acid**

* Mix the resulting salicylic acid with acetic anhydride ((CH₃CO)₂O) in the presence of a catalyst like sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)
* Heat the mixture gently (<50°C) to facilitate the reaction:
C₇H₆O₃ + (CH₃CO)₂O → C₉H₈O₄ + CH₃COOH
