75,"Now, I'll evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:

[(2/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 3] - [(2/3)(1)^3 + (3/2)(1)^2 + 1]

= [(2/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 3] - [(2/3)(1) + (3/2)(1) + 1]

76,"Now, to evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3, I'll plug in the limits of integration:

[(2/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 3] - [(2/3)(1)^3 + (3/2)(1)^2 + 1]

Simplifying the expression, I get:

[(2/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 3] - [(2/3)(1) + (3/2)(1) + 1]
= [18 + 27/2 + 3] - [2/3 + 3/2 + 1]
= [45/2 + 3] - [11/6 + 1]
= (45/2 + 18/1) - (11/6 + 6/6)
= 63/2 - 17/6

Combining the fractions, I get:

(189 - 102)/12 = 87/12

So, the definite integral of 2x^2 + 3x + 1 from 1 to 3 is 87/12.assistant

I can also provide you with a more concise solution:

Let's integrate the function f(x) = 2x² + 3x + 1:

∫(2x² + 3x + 1) dx = (2/3)x³ + (3/2)x² + x + C

Evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:

[(2/3)(3)³ + (3/2)(3)² + 3] - [(2/3)(1)³ + (3/2)(1)² + 1]
= (18 + 27/2 + 3) - (2/3 + 3/2 + 1)
= 87/12

The definite integral of 2x² + 3x + 1 from 1 to 3 is indeed **87/12**.assistant

77,"Now, to evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3, I'll plug in the limits of integration:

∫[1,3] (2x^2 + 3x + 1) dx = [(2/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 3] - [(2/3)(1)^3 + (3/2)(1)^2 + 1]

Simplifying the expression, I get:

= [(2/3)(27) + (9)(3) + 3] - [(2/3) + (3/2) + 1]
= [18 + 27 + 3] - [2/3 + 3/2 + 1]
= 48 - (4/3 + 3/2 + 1)
= 48 - (8/6 + 9/6 + 6/6)
= 48 - 23/6

Multiplying the fraction by 6 to eliminate the denominator:

= 48 - 23

So, the definite integral is:

∫[1,3] (2x^2 + 3x + 1) dx = 25assistant
