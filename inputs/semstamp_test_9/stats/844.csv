Given equation: x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = 0

We can start by noticing that this is a quadratic equation in x^2, so we can substitute u = x^2 to get:

u^2 - 21u + 4 = 0

Now, we can factorize the quadratic equation:

(u - 1)(u - 20) = 0

This gives us two possible values for u:

u - 1 = 0 => u = 1... (1)
u - 20 = 0 => u = 20... (2)

Now, we'll substitute back u = x^2:

From (1): x^2 = 1 => x = ±1

From (2): x^2 = 20 => x = ±√20 (or approximately ±4.47)

So, the solutions to the original equation are:

x = 1, x = -1, x ≈ 4.47, and x ≈ -4.47assistant
