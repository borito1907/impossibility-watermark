Given equation: x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = 0

Notice that this equation is a quadratic in x^2, so we can substitute u = x^2 to get:

u^2 - 21u + 4 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in u, and we can factor it:

(u - 1)(u - 20) = 0

This gives us two solutions for u:

u - 1 = 0 => u = 1... (1)
u - 20 = 0 => u = 20... (2)

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of x.",True,7,"6,2",True,47
98,"Let's break it down step by step:

The given equation is: x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = 0

**Step 1: Factor the equation (if possible)**
After some effort, I found that this equation can be factored as:
(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 17) = 0

**Step 2: Solve for each factor**
Now, we'll solve for each factor separately:

**(a) x^2 - 4 = 0**
This gives us: x^2 = 4 --> x = ±√4 --> x = ±2

**(b) x^2 - 17 = 0**
This gives us: x^2 = 17 --> x = ±√17 (approximately ±4.12)

So, we have four solutions:

x ≈ -4.12, x ≈ -2, x ≈ 2, and x ≈ 4.12

Therefore, the solutions to the equation x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = 0 are x ≈ -4.12, x ≈ -2, x ≈ 2, and x ≈ 4.12.assistant
