",True,7,"7,2",True,12
13,"Here's what you need to know:

**Why it matters:** PPB affects the distribution, absorption,  pharmacological response, metabolism,ability, elimination (ADME), and ultimately, the efficacy of a drug.",True,1,"6,3",True,1
14,"Plasma proteins, The majority of medications bind to these proteins,Â­, (e.g., albumin, in the blood).",True,7,"6,3",True,2
15,"Here's a breakdown:

**Plasma Proteins:** These are proteins present in blood plasma, (the liquid portion of blood), which play important roles in various physiological processes.",True,0,"6,3",True,3
16,"Here's a detailed explanation:

**Plasma Proteins:**
When a drug is administered, A variety of proteins are present in blood plasma, the liquid portion of the blood., albumin, globulins, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globulins, by far the most abundant protein in human plasma is albumin., These proteins have different binding capacities and specificities for various compounds.

",True,1,"6,3",True,4
17,"Here's what you need to know:

**Why does it matter?",False,,,,5
18,"Plasma proteins, this context include albumin, human serum albumin (HSA), alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), lipoproteins, other minor proteins that make up approximately 7% of blood plasma by weight.

",True,0,"6,3",True,6
19,"Plasma proteins, (e.g., albumin, lipoproteins, A-G,binding globulin, a glycoprotein that binds to bilirubin, free fatty acids and various metabolites) play a crucial role in the transport and distribution of drugs throughout the body.",True,4,"6,3",True,7
20,"Here's what you need to know:

**What happens:**

When a drug enters the bloodstream, the circulatory system, of an individual, it can bind to various plasma proteins such as albumin, lipoproteins, :globulins, and glycoproteins these plasma proteins have specific binding sites for drugs The extent of PPB varies widely among different drugs and even among different individuals 

**Why it matters:**

Plasma protein binding has significant implications for pharmacokinetics because only the unbound or free fraction of a drug is available to diffuse into tissues including target organs where it exerts its therapeutic effects Bound drug remains in the vascular compartment and does not contribute to the pharmacological response Thus the degree of PPB influences the efficacy safety and distribution of a drug within the body 

**Factors that influence PPB:**

Several factors can affect the extent of plasma protein binding including:

1.",True,3,"6,3",True,8
