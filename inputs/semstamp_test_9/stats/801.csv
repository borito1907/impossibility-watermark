The Lazy Caterer's Sequence is a well-known sequence in combinatorial mathematics, the nth term of which can be expressed as:

L(n) = 2^(n-1) + 1

Now, let's assume that L(n) has a power of 2 as a factor for some n.

Then, we can write: L(n) = 2^k * m, where k > 1 and m is an odd integer (since 2^k is a power of 2).
