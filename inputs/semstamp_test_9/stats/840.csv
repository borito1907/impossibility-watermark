**Expression:** 3 - 5%4 + 20 - 100/3 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 1: Evaluate percentage**
5% of 4 = (5/100) * 4 = 0.2

So, the expression becomes:
3 - 0.2 + 20 - 100/3 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 2: Evaluate divisions**
100/3 = 33.33 (approximately)

The expression becomes:
3 - 0.2 + 20 - 33.33 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 3: Evaluate multiplications**
23*73 = 1679

3*2 = 6

The expression becomes:
3 - 0.2 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 300*6 + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 4: Evaluate another multiplication**
300*6 = 1800

The expression becomes:
3 - 0.2 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 5: Evaluate the last multiplication**
100*1.3 = 130

The expression becomes:
3 - 0.2 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 6: Simplify and evaluate the final expression**

First, let's simplify the fractions:
1/3 = 0.33 (approximately)

Now, evaluate the expression:
3 - 0.2 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 0.33 =
= 3 - 0.2 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 132.33 +
= -10.53 + 1679 - 1800 + 132.33 +
= -161.54 + 132.33 +
= -29.21

Therefore, the final answer is approximately **-29.21**.assistant

Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1:** Evaluate the modulo operation (%)
```
4 % 4 = 0 (since 4 divides 4 exactly with no remainder)
So, replace 4 % 4 with 0:
3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 100/3 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 2:** Evaluate the division (/)
```
100 / 3 = 33.33 (approximately)
Replace 100 / 3 with 33.33:
3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 3:** Evaluate the multiplication (*)
```
23 * 73 = 1679 
3 * 2 = 6 
 Replace the multiplications:
3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 300*6 + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 4:** Evaluate the remaining multiplication and division:
```
300 * 6 = 1800 
100 * 1.3 = 130 
1 / 3 ≈ 0.33 (approximately)
Replace the evaluations:
3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 0.33

**Step 5:** Simplify the expression by combining like terms:
```
Combine constants: 3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 130 + 2 + 0.33 = 117 
Subtract 1800 from 1679: 1679 - 1800 = -121 
Add the result to 117: 117 - 121 = -4 

The final answer is: -4assistant

Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate the modulus operation (%)**
4%4 = 0 (since 4 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 0)

So, the expression becomes:
3 - 0 + 20 - 100/3 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 2: Evaluate the multiplications**
23*73 = 1679

300*(3*2) = 300*6 = 1800

100*1.3 = 130

**Step 3: Evaluate the divisions**
100/3 = 33.33 (approximately)

**Step 4: Substitute the results back into the expression**
3 - 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**
Combine like terms:
3 + 20 - 33.33 = -10.33

Add 1679:
-10.33 + 1679 = 1668.67

Subtract 1800:
1668.67 - 1800 = -131.33

Add 130:
-131.33 + 130 = -1.33

Add 2:
-1.33 + 2 = 0.67

Finally, add 1/3:
0.67 + 1/3 = 0.67 + 0.33 = 1

Therefore, the final answer is:
