Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1:** Evaluate the modulus operation % (remainder)
`5%4 = 1` (because 5 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1)

**Step 2:** Evaluate the division /
`100/3 = 33.33` (approximately)

**Step 3:** Multiply 23 and 73 
`23*73 = 1679`

**Step 4:** Multiply 300 and `(3*2)` 
`3*2 = 6`
`300*6 = 1800`

**Step 5:** Multiply 100 and `1.3` 
`100*1.3 = 130`

Now, let's assemble the expression with the evaluated values:

`3 - 1 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 1/3`

**Step 6:** Simplify the expression:
`3 - 1 = 2`
`2 + 20 = 22`
`22 - 33.33 = -11.33`
`-11.33 + 1679 = 1667.67`
`1667.67 - 1800 = -132.33`
`-132.33 + 130 = -2.33`
`-2.33 + 2 = -0.33`
`-0.33 + 1/3 = -0.33 + 0.33 = 0`

The final result is: **0**assistant
