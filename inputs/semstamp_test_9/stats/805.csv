Let's multiply 652 and 134 step by step:

**Step 1: Write the numbers side by side**

```
   652 
x 134 
------
```

**Step 2: Multiply each digit of the top number (652) with the bottom number (134), starting from the right**

First, let's multiply the ones place of 652 (2) with 134:

```
   652 
x 134 
------
     268 (2 x 134 = 268)
```

Next, let's multiply the tens place of 652 (5) with 134:

```
   652 
x 134 
------
    6700 (50 x 134 = 6700)
```

Finally, let's multiply the hundreds place of 652 (6) with 134:

```
   652 
x 134 
------
   80400 (600 x 134 = 80400)
```

**Step 3: Add up the partial products**

Now, let's add up the partial products we got in Step 2:

```
   652 
x 134 
------
     268

```
  652 ( multiplicand )
× 134 ( multiplier )
------
```

**Step 2: Multiply each digit of the multiplier by the multiplicand**

First, let's multiply the multiplicand (652) by the hundreds place of the multiplier (100):

```
  652 
× 100 = 65200 (partial product)
```

Next, let's multiply the multiplicand (652) by the tens place of the multiplier (30):

```
  652 
× 30 = 19560 (partial product)
```

Finally, let's multiply the multiplicand (652) by the ones place of the multiplier (4):

```
  652 
× 4 = 2608 (partial product)
```

**Step 3: Add up the partial products**

Now that we have our three partial products, let's add them up:
