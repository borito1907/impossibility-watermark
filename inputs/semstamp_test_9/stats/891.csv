A quadratic equation!

",True,5,"7,2",True,1

I'd be happy to help you solve that quadratic equation!

",True,5,"7,2",True,2

Let's solve the quadratic equation 5x^2 + 15x - 45 = 0.

",True,5,"7,2",True,3
4,"

Let's factor the quadratic equation:

5x^2 + 15x - 45 = 0

We can start by factoring out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients, which is 5:

5(x^2 + 3x - 9) = 0

Now, let's try to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:

x^2 + 3x - 9 = (x + 6)(x - 1.5) = 0

So, we have:

5(x + 6)(x - 1.5) = 0

This tells us that either (x + 6) = 0 or (x - 1.5) = 0.

",True,7,"7,2",True,4
5,"Solving for x, we get:

x + 6 = 0 --> x = -6

x - 1.5 = 0 --> x = 1.5

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -6 and x = 1.5.assistant

Would you like me to explain the steps again or help with anything else?assistant
