209,"To illustrate this concept, let's write some Python code:
```python

import random

def weighted_random_200():
    r = random.random()  # Uniformly distributed between 0 and 1
    
    if r < 0.6:  # 60% of the time, pick from [1, 400)
        return int(random.uniform(1, 400))
    else:  # 40% of the time, pick from [400, 1000]
        return int(random.uniform(400, 1000))

# Test the function by generating many random numbers and calculating the mean:
numbers = [weighted_random_200() for _ in range(100000)]
mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(""Mean:"", mean_value)

```
Running this code should produce a mean value close to 200.

",True,0,"6,2",True,2
210,"In Python, you can implement this using the following code:
```python

import random

def weighted_random():
    r = random.random()
    if r < 0.6:
        return int(random.uniform(1, 400))  # 60% chance, [1, 400)
    else:
        return int(random.uniform(400, 1000))  # 40% chance, [400, 1000)

# Test the function with many iterations to verify the average converges to 200:
num_samples = 1000000

total_sum = sum(weighted_random() for _ in range(num_samples))
avg = total_sum / num_samples

print(""Average:"", avg)
```
This implementation uses the `random` module in Python to generate a random number between 0 and 1, and then applies the weighted probability distribution to select a number from either segment.
