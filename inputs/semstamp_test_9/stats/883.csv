Here's some numeric data about Proxima b:

**Orbital Characteristics:**

* Orbital Period: 11.186 days (±0.003)
* Semi-Major Axis: 0.0485 AU (astronomical units, where 1 AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun)
* Eccentricity: 0.0 (assumed to be circular orbit)

**Physical Characteristics:**

* Mass:
	+ Minimum Mass (m sin i): 1.3 M⊕ (Earth masses) [1]
	+ Mass Range: 1-3 M⊕ [2]
* Radius:
	+ Radius Range: 0.8-1.4 R⊕ (Earth radii) [2]
* Surface Gravity: 
	+ g = 0.98 ± 0.15 g⊕ (surface gravity of Earth) [3]

**Atmospheric Properties:**

* Atmospheric Composition: Unknown, but models suggest:
	+ A thick atmosphere with high levels of CO2, N2, and H2O [4]
	+ Possibility of a thin atmosphere or no atmosphere at all [5]
* Atmospheric Escape Rate: Unknown, but models suggest:
	+ Hydrogen escape rate: 10^25 – 10^28 s^-1 [6]

**Surface Conditions:**

* Equilibrium Temperature: 
	+ Tmin ≈ -12°C to -8°C (-10°F to 18°F) for a dry surface [7]
	+ Tmax ≈ 30°C to 40°C (86°F to 104°F) for a wet surface [7]
* Insolation: 0.034 × Earth's insolation (very low levels of sunlight)

**Other Notes:**

* Proxima b is a terrestrial planet, meaning it has a solid surface.
