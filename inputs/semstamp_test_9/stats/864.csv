Here's a more explicit representation for small values of n:

**2D Rotation Matrix:**

Here's a breakdown of the rotation matrix for smaller dimensions:

**2D Rotation Matrix**

For a 2D rotation by an angle θ around the origin, the rotation matrix is:

R = | cos(θ)  -sin(θ) |
    | sin(θ)   cos(θ) |

**3D Rotation Matrix**

For a 3D rotation by an angle θ around a unit vector Ω = (k, l, m), the rotation matrix is:

R = | k²(1-cos(θ)) + cos(θ)  l*k*(1-cos(θ)) - m*sin(θ)  m*k*(1-cos(θ)) + l*sin(θ) |
    | l*k*(1-cos(θ)) + m*sin(θ)  l²(1-cos(θ)) + cos(θ)  m*l*(1-cos(θ)) - k*sin(θ) |
    | m*k*(1-cos(θ)) - l*sin(θ)  m*l*(1-cos(θ)) + k*sin(θ)  m²(1-cos(θ)) + cos(θ) |

These matrices will help you perform rotations in 2D and 3D spaces, respectively.

Would you like me to explain how these matrices work, or perhaps discuss some applications or optimizations for higher-dimensional spaces?assistant

Here's a breakdown of the rotation matrix formula for smaller dimensions:

**2D Rotation Matrix**

Given an angle θ, the 2D rotation matrix R is:

R = | cos(θ)  -sin(θ) |
    | sin(θ)   cos(θ) |

**3D Rotation Matrix**

For a 3D rotation around a unit vector Ω = (Ωx, Ωy, Ωz), we have three cases:

**Case 1: Rotation around x-axis (Ω = (1, 0, 0))**

R = | 1       0        0     |
    | 0   cos(θ)  -sin(θ) |
    | 0   sin(θ)   cos(θ) |

**Case 2: Rotation around y-axis (Ω = (0, 1, 0))**

R = |  cos(θ)  0   sin(θ) |
    | 0       1       0     |
    | -sin(θ)  0   cos(θ) |

**Case 3: Rotation around z-axis (Ω = (0, 0, 1))**

R = |  cos(θ) -sin(θ)  0    |
    | sin(θ)   cos(θ)  0    |
    | 0       0       1    |

These formulas represent counter-clockwise rotations when looking in the direction of the positive axis.

Do you have any questions about implementing these rotation matrices in your code or would you like some help with a specific programming language?assistant

Also, keep in mind that the n-dimensional rotation matrix formula I provided earlier is a generalization for higher dimensions, but it might not be the most efficient or practical approach for certain applications.

Here's an example of the 2D rotation matrix:

R₂₋ᵗ([θ]) = [cos(θ)    -sin(θ)]
          [sin(θ)     cos(θ)]

And here's the 3D rotation matrix, often represented in terms of Euler angles (α, β, γ):

R₃₋ᵗ([α, β, γ]) = 
  [cos(α)cos(β)cos(γ)-sin(α)sin(γ)   -cos(α)cos(β)sin(γ)-sin(α)cos(γ)   cos(α)sin(β)]
  [sin(α)cos(β)cos(γ)+cos(α)sin(γ)   -sin(α)cos(β)sin(γ)+cos(α)cos(γ)   sin(α)sin(β)]
  [-sin(β)cos(γ)                          sin(β)sin(γ)                             cos(β)]

These matrices describe counterclockwise rotations by the specified angles around the respective axes.
