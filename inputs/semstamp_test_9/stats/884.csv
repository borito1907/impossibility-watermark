115,"Rearranging the equation to solve for x, we get:

x ≈ 0.17(x + y)
x ≈ 0.17x + 0.17y

Subtracting 0.17x from both sides gives:

0.83x ≈ 0.17y

Dividing both sides by 0.83 yields:

x ≈ 0.205y

Since x and y must be integers, the simplest ratio that satisfies this equation is:

x : y ≈ 1 : 4.88

Rounding y to the nearest whole number, the final dilution ratio is approximately:

1 : 5
