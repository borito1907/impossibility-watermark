Notice that this equation is quadratic in x², which means we can substitute u = x² to convert it into a quadratic equation in u.

100,"Let's break it down step by step:

x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = 0

We can start by noticing that the left-hand side is a quadratic function in x^2, so we can substitute u = x^2 to get:

u^2 - 21u + 4 = 0

This is now a quadratic equation in u, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:

u = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -21, and c = 4, so:

u = (21 ± √((-21)^2 - 4*1*4)) / 2*1

Simplifying, we get two possible values for u:

u = (21 ± √441 - 16) / 2

u = (21 ± √425) / 2

u = (21 ± 20.62) / 2

Now, we have two possible values for u:

u ≈ (21 + 20.62) / 2 = 20.81 ≈ 21 (approximately)

u ≈ (21 - 20.62) / 2 ≈ 0.19

Since u = x^2, we take the square root of both values to get:

x^2 ≈ 21 => x ≈ ±√21 (approximately)

x^2 ≈ 0.19 => x ≈ ±√0.19 (approximately)

So, our final solutions are:

x ≈ ±√21 (approximately)
x ≈ ±√0.19 (approximately)

Rearranging these expressions, we get four distinct roots:

x ≈ ±4.58 (approximately)
x ≈ ±0.44 (approximately)
