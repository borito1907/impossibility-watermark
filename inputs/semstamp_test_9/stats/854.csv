* Height: 4.8-5.2 meters (15.7-17.1 feet)
* Length: 6-6.4 meters (19.7-21 feet)
* Width: approximately 0.5-0.7 meters (1.6-2.3 feet)

For simplicity, let's assume our giraffe is roughly cylindrical in shape, with a slightly oval cross-section.

* Length: 6.1-6.4 meters (20-21 feet)
* Shoulder width: 0.7-0.8 meters (2.3-2.6 feet)

Using these dimensions, we can approximate the volume of a giraffe as follows:

Volume = Length x Width x Height

Assuming a rectangular prism shape (which is not entirely accurate, but will give us a rough estimate):

Volume ≈ 6.2 meters (length) x 0.75 meters (width) x 5.35 meters (height) ≈ 23.33 cubic meters

So, the estimated volume of a giraffe would be around 23.33 cubic meters.",True,2,"5,2",True,1
