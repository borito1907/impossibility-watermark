The energy content of 1 liter (L) of ethanol is approximately:

6,930 kilocalories (kcal)
or 
29,200 kilojoules (kJ)

To convert this to joules, we can multiply by 1000 (since there are 1000 joules in 1 kilojoule):

29,200 kJ x 1000 = 29,200,000 joules

So, there are approximately 29,200,000 joules of energy in 1 liter of ethanol.assistant
