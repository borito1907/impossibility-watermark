Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate the modulus operation (%):**

`4%4 = 0` (because 4 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 0)

So, the expression becomes:
`3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 100/3 + 23*73 - 300*(3*2) + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3`

**Step 2: Evaluate the division (/) and multiplication (*):**

`100/3 = 33.33` (approximately)
`23*73 = 1679`
`3*2 = 6`
`300*6 = 1800`
`100*1.3 = 130`

So, the expression becomes:
`3 - 5 + 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 1/3`

**Step 3: Simplify the expression:**

Combine like terms:
`3 - 5 = -2`
`-2 + 0 = -2`
`-2 + 20 = 18`
`18 - 33.33 = -15.33`
 `-15.33 + 1679 = 1663.67`
 `1663.67 - 1800 = -136.33`
 `-136.33 + 130 = -6.33`
 `-6.33 + 2 = -4.33`
 `-4.33 + 1/3 = -4.33 + 0.33 = -4`

Therefore, the final answer is:
`-4`assistant
