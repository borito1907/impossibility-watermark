Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside parentheses**

* 3*2 = 6 (inside the parentheses)
* 100/3 = 33.33 (approximately) (inside the fraction)

So, the updated expression becomes:
3 - 5 % 4 + 20 - 33.33 + 23*73 - 300*6 + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 2: Evaluate the modulus operation**

* 5 % 4 = 1 (because 5 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1)

Updated expression:
3 - 1 + 20 - 33.33 + 23*73 - 300*6 + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 3: Multiply and evaluate large multiplications**

* 23*73 = 1679 (approximately)
* 300*6 = 1800

Updated expression:
3 - 1 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 100*1.3 + 2 + 1/3

**Step 4: Evaluate remaining multiplications and additions/subtractions**

* 100*1.3 = 130

Now, let's perform the operations from left to right:
= 3 - 1 + 20 = 22 (so far)
= 22 - 33.33 = -11.33 (so far)
= -11.33 + 1679 = 1667.67 (so far)
= 1667.67 - 1800 = -132.33 (so far)
= -132.33 + 130 = -2.33 (so far)
= -2.33 + 2 = -0.33 (so far)
= -0.33 + 1/3 ≈ -0.33 + 0.33 = 0 (approximately)

Therefore, the final result is approximately **0**.assistant

Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1:** Evaluate the modulus operation (%)

`4%4 = 0` (because 4 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 0)

So, the expression becomes:
`3 - 5 * 0 + 20 - 100/3 + 23 * 73 - 300 * (3 * 2) + 100 * 1.3 + 2 + 1/3`

**Step 2:** Evaluate the multiplications and divisions from left to right

`3 * 2 = 6`
`100/3 = 33.33` (approximate value)
`23 * 73 = 1679`
`300 * 6 = 1800`

Substitute these values into the expression:
`3 - 5 * 0 + 20 - 33.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 100 * 1.3 + 2 + 1/3`

**Step 3:** Simplify the expression further

`3 - 0 + 20 - 33.33 = -10.33`
`100 * 1.3 = 130`
`1/3 ≈ 0.33`

Now, substitute these values back into the expression:
`-10.33 + 1679 - 1800 + 130 + 2 + 0.33`

**Step 4:** Combine like terms and simplify

`-10.33 + 1679 = 1668.67`
`1668.67 - 1800 = -131.33`
`-131.33 + 130 = -1.33`
`-1.33 + 2 = 0.67`
`0.67 + 0.33 = 1`

Therefore, the final answer is approximately **1**.assistant
