### Alternative Methods ###

**Method 1: Completing the Square**

Let's rearrange the equation to make it easier to work with:
x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 --> x^2 + 2x = 3

Now, add and subtract 1 on the right side:
x^2 + 2x + 1 = 3 + 1 --> (x + 1)^2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides:
x + 1 = ±√4 --> x + 1 = ±2

Subtract 1 from both sides to find the solutions:
x = -1 ± 2 --> x = -3 or x = 1

**Method 2: Quadratic Formula**

The quadratic formula is a more general method that works for all quadratic equations:
