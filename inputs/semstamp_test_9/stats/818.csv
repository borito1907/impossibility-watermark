Let's solve for x step by step:

**Step 1:** Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
```
104/2 = 52 (since 104 divided by 2 is 52)
```
So, the equation becomes:
```
100x = 52 + 30 
```

**Step 2:** Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by adding 52 and 30:
```
100x = 82 
```

**Step 3:** Divide both sides of the equation by 100 to isolate x:
```
x = 82/100 
```

**Step 4:** Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:
```
x = 41/50 
```

Therefore, the value of x is **41/50** or **0.82**.assistant
