To begin, an introduction to Lagrangian mechanics:

* **Generalized coordinates**: q = x(t)
* **Lagrangian function**: L(q, ∂q/∂t, t) = T - U, (Kinetic energy minus Potential energy)

For our SHO:

* **Kinetic energy**: T(x, ∂x/∂t) = ½m(∂x/∂t)^2 (mass times velocity squared)
* **Potential energy**: U(x) = ½kx^2 (spring energy proportional to displacement squared)

Now, let's write the Lagrangian:

**Euler-Lagrange Equations**

To derive the equations of motion, we apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:

Now,ing the definitions:

**Euler-Lagrange Equations**

To derive the equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equation is applied:

Taking the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = -k\*x... (force due to spring compression/expansion)
∂L/∂(dx/dt) = m\*(dx/dt)... (momentum)

Plugging these into the Euler-Lagrange equation:

Simplifying:
