Let's break down the expression step by step:

**Step 1: Evaluate the percentage**
6% = 6/100 = 0.06

So, the expression becomes:
2*9*(0.06*4)+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 2: Multiply 2 and 9**
2*9 = 18

The expression becomes:
18*(0.06*4)+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 3: Multiply 0.06 and 4**
0.06*4 = 0.24

The expression becomes:
18*0.24+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 4: Multiply 18 and 0.24**
18*0.24 = 4.32

The expression becomes:
4.32+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 5: Divide 4000 by 56**
4000/56 = 71.43 (approximately)

The expression becomes:
4.32+6-71.43+123/321+40/2+9

**Step 6: Divide 123 by 321**
123/321 ≈ 0.38

The expression becomes:
4.32+6-71.43+0.38+40/2+9

**Step 7: Divide 40 by 2**
40/2 = 20

The expression becomes:
4.32+6-71.43+0.38+20+9

**Step 8: Simplify the expression**
Combine like terms:
4.32 + 6 + 0.38 = 10.70 (approximately)
Subtract 71.43 from 10.70:
-60.73 (approximately)
Add 20 and 9 to -60.73:
-31.73 (approximately)

Therefore, the final result is approximately **-31.73**.assistant
