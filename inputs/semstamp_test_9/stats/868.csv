14,"Here's an absolutely convoluted and unnecessarily complicated way to calculate 2+2:

**Step 1: Convert to Binary**

First, convert both numbers to binary (base 2):

2 in decimal = 10 in binary (since 2^1 = 2)
2 in decimal = 10 in binary (since 2^1 = 2)

So, we have:
10 (binary) + 10 (binary)

**Step 2: Represent as Fibonacci Numbers**

Now, represent each binary number as a sum of Fibonacci numbers (a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...):

10 (binary) = 8 + 2 (Fibonacci representation, since 8 = F6 and 2 = F3)

**Step 1: Ancient Sumerian Numerology**
 Convert each number to its corresponding Sumerian numeral:
