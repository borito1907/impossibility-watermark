We have: x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = 0... (1)

Notice that the left side is a quadratic function in x^2, so we can try to factor it.

94,"Let's try to factor it:

x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1) = (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) = 0

Now, we can solve for x by setting each factor equal to 0:

x - 2 = 0 => x = 2

x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

x - 1 = 0 => x = 1

x + 1 = 0 => x = -1

So, the solutions are: x = -2, x = -1, x = 1, and x = 2.

96,"Let's factor it:

x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 1) = 0

Now, we can solve for each factor:

x^2 - 4 = 0 --> x^2 = 4 --> x = ±2

x^2 - 1 = 0 --> x^2 = 1 --> x = ±1

So, the solutions to the original equation are:

x = -2, x = 2, x = -1, and x = 1.

x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 20) = 0

Now, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:

x^2 - 1 = 0 --> x^2 = 1 --> x = ±1

x^2 - 20 = 0 --> x^2 = 20 --> x = ±√20

So, the solutions to the equation are:

x = 1, x = -1, x = √20, and x = -√20.

100,"Let's factor it:

x⁴ - 21x² + 4 = (x² - 4)(x² - 17) = 0

Now, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:

**Factor 1:** x² - 4 = 0

x² = 4

x = ±2

**Factor 2:** x² - 17 = 0

x² = 17

x = ±√17

So, the solutions to the equation are:
