The given equation is: x⁴ - 21x² + 4 = 0

u² - 21u + 4 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in u, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:

u = (21 ± √(21² - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)
u = (21 ± √(441 - 16)) / 2 
u = (21 ± √425) / 2

Now, we have two possible values for u:
u₁ = (21 + 7√25) / 2 
u₂ = (21 - 7√25) / 2
