How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's work it out step by step.

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

2. Add 6 and 20: 6 + 20 = 26

3. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

4. Subtract 1.5 from 26: 26 - 1.5 = 24.5

5. Finally, add 1 to 24.5: 24.5 + 1 = 25.5

So, the final answer is 25.5!assistant

How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's work it out step by step.

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

2. Add 6 and 20: 6 + 20 = 26

3. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

4. Subtract 1.5 from 26: 26 - 1.5 = 24.5

5. Finally, add 1 to 24.5: 24.5 + 1 = 25.5

So, the final answer is 25.5!assistant

How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's work it out step by step.

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20

2. Add 6 and 20: 6 + 20 = 26

3. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5

4. Subtract 1.5 from 26: 26 - 1.5 = 24.5

5. Finally, add 1 to 24.5: 24.5 + 1 = 25.5

So, the final answer is 25.5!assistant
