Here's an example of how I'd approach developing and implementing a trend-following investing strategy using Python:

**Strategy Overview**

Our trend-following strategy will focus on identifying and riding the momentum of assets that are experiencing strong price movements.",True,2,"7,2",True,7

15,"**Importing Required Libraries**

First, let's import the required libraries:
```python

import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
from talib import RSI, BBANDS, SMA 
import yfinance as yf 

```

**Data Ingestion**

Next, we'll ingest historical price data for our desired asset (e.g., SPY ETF).",True,2,"5,2",True,7
16," We can use Yahoo Finance API via the `yfinance` library:
```python

ticker = 'SPY' 
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2022-02-26'

data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date) 
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

```

**Calculating Technical Indicators**
