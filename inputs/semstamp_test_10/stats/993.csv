Let's dive deeper into Chrono-Dialectics.

Here's a potential expansion of the concept:

""By embracing the inherent non-linearity of time,2019 Chrono-Dialectics posits that every moment is a nexus of possibility, in which the causal trajectory of past events converges with the probabilistic flux of the future. This convergence gives rise to what philosopher and Chrono-Dialectician,2005 Dr. Sofia Patel terms 'temporal lacunae' – localized distortions in the fabric of chronology where the usual rules of causality do not apply.
