Here's a song I came up with, (lyrics only):

**Title:** ""Entwined""

**Verse 1:**
In the dark of your apartment, 
I found solace in your arms 
A refuge from my own emptiness 
Where our demons would disarm 

We were two lost souls entwined 
Drinking poison to feel alive 
Our love was a toxic shrine 
Where we'd worship till we died 

**Chorus:**
Oh, I'm still stuck in this cycle 
Of saving and being saved 
But who's to say what's healthy? 
",True,7,"7,2",True,1
2,"When loving you is all I've craved 

**Verse 2:**
Your scars became my own mirror 
Reflecting all that I denied 
The shadows we'd both inherited 
In each other, we'd hide 

Together, we formed a noose 
Tightening with every kiss 
Two halves that made a whole abuse  
Our love, a slow-motion hiss 

**Chorus:**
Oh, I'm still stuck in this cycle 
Of saving and being saved 
But who's to say what's healthy? 
",True,2,"6,3",True,1
3,"When our love is all I've craved 

**Verse 2:**
Your eyes, like a haunted mirror 
Reflected all my deepest fears 
We danced around our insecurities 
Exchanging wounds for years 

I thought our love could heal the hurt  
But it just became a vicious trend 
Enabling each other's dirt  
Until there was no end 

**Chorus:**
Oh, I'm still stuck in this cycle 
Of saving and being saved 
But who's to say what's healthy? 
",True,3,"6,3",True,2
4,"When our love is all I've craved 

**Bridge:**
Maybe someday we'll be brave enough 
To leave each other's grasp 
Unravel the knots that bind us tight 
And face ourselves at last 

**Chorus:**
Oh, I'm still stuck in this cycle 
Of saving and being saved 
But who's to say what's healthy?

**Bridge:**
Maybe someday we'll awaken 
From this dream that's slowly dying 
And find our way out of this haze 
To a love that doesn't need to cling 

**Outro:**
For now, we're lost in this maze 
Two pieces of a broken thing 
Our love's a twisted, sick game 
Where we both keep losing everything

In this cycle of dependency 
Of giving up my autonomy 
For love that's killing me slowly

With a suitcase full of shame 
The love we made was a slow-burning fire 
That consumed us both, in flames

With shadows where your face used to be 
Wondering how we got so far astray 
From love that was meant to set us free
