Here's a set of lyrics in the style of Roger Waters, years:

**Verse 1**
In the halls of power, where the elite reside 
A cabal of cronies, concocting lies inside 
Their suits are tailored, their words are slick and bright 
But behind the facade, they're devouring our sight 

**Chorus**
Oh, Britain's lost its way, adrift on a sea of shame 
The government's to blame, serving only their own name 
Freedom's just a word, an illusion we can't claim 
As they line their pockets with gold, we're left to bear the blame 

**Verse 2**
They talk of austerity, but it's just a ruse 
To bleed the common man, while they indulge in abuse 
Of privilege and wealth, of power and pride 
Leaving us to fight for scraps, as they gluttonously divide 

**Chorus**
Oh, Britain's lost its way, adrift on a sea of shame 
The government's to blame, serving only their own name 
Freedom's just a word, an illusion we can't claim 
As they line their pockets with gold, we're left to bear the blame 

**Bridge**
From privatized NHS to the surveillance state 
We're living in a dystopia, where fear is the weight 
That crushes our dissent, silences our voice 
In this Orwellian nightmare, we're losing our choice 

**Verse 3**
They peddle fear and division, as they fan the flames 
Of nationalism and hate, in xenophobic games 
The vulnerable suffer, the poor are left to decay 
While they, in Westminster, play out their final sway 

**Chorus**
Oh, Britain's lost its way, adrift on a sea of shame 
The government's to blame, serving only their own name 
Freedom's just a word, an illusion we can't claim 
As they line their pockets with gold, we're left to bear the blame 

**Outro**
So rise up, people, let your anger be heard 
Reject this corrupt regime, tear down the barricades, oh so blurred 
Take back what's rightfully yours, don't let them hold you down 
In this struggle for justice, we'll wear our rebel crown.

**""The Iron Cage""**

[Verse 1]
In the shadow of the crown, Austerity's cold design 
They suffocate our every dream, with their lies and their crimes 
Taxing our sweat and our tears, They feign concern and care 
As they ravage all that's dear,2019 and nothing's changed

Trapped inside this iron cage  
Where freedom's just a distant stage  
A farce of democracy  
We're held hostage by hypocrisy

Eton's elite hold court again  
Self-serving,self-appointed  
Their ivory towers high above the fray 
While we drown in debt,and grey days  
The NHS in shambles lies  
Food banks for the many, the few get by  
On the backs of the voiceless,they ride

Trapped inside this iron cage

As they dismantle all we hold as sacred claim 
The NHS, the welfare state, all sold 
To privateers who care not for the old

From Grenfell's ashes to Windrush's pain 
The vulnerable are trampled again and again 
The government's response, a callous shrug 
As they wash their hands of blood and hug

Oh, Britannia's lost its way 
A kingdom built on lies and grey 
Beneath the flag our hearts betray 
The dream is dead, the nightmare stays

For in the silence, injustice thrives 
Together, let's reclaim what's rightfully alive

Oh, in Whitehall, where shadows play  
The puppets dance, strings pulled all day  
In Westminster's hallowed halls, corruption reigns  
As freedom slowly drains, away  

**Verse 2:**
Billionaires' bidding done, behind closed doors  
Secret handshakes sealing fates of those who bore  
The weight of austerity, a false economy's toll  
A nation sold out, soul by soul  
Meanwhile the elite just laugh and spin  
As the working class is crushed beneath their wheels within

Left to rot, the dreams that once ignited  
Healthcare's embers dying out

And still they justify their grab for more  
Leaving us to fight over the scraps they leave on the floor

Surveillance State, where privacy's a crime  
Free speech muzzled by thought police in rhyme  
Protest silenced, dissenters jailed or fined  
In this 'democracy', our chains entwined  
For the few, the spoils; the many, mere pawns  
A toxic legacy, forever spawned  

**Chorus:**
Oh in Whitehall, where shadows play  
The puppets dance, strings pulled all day  
In Westminster's hallowed halls, corruption reigns  
As freedom slowly drains away

As we drown in their deceitful state 

**Bridge**
We're living in a dreamworld, where the truth is hard to find 
Drowning in a sea of propaganda, our minds entwined 
Toxic ideologies, masquerading as facts 
In this Orwellian nightmare, we act 

**Verse 3**
Crony capitalism, feeding on our fears 
Public assets sold, private tears  
The NHS, a skeleton, on life support machine 
Education, a commodity, bought at an obscene scene 

**Chorus**
Oh, shadows on the throne, pulling strings unseen 
Ruling with an iron fist, their grip is all too clean 
Invisible hands that shape our fate 
As we drown in their deceitful state 

**Outro**
Rise up, people!",True,3,"6,2",True,47

Here's a song in the style of Roger Waters, a rant against the British government:

**Title:** ""The Hollow Crown""

**Verse 1:**
In the shadow of the throne, as old as time itself,
Lies a web of deceit and half-truths to sell,
Our leaders speak of freedom, in hushed tones of despair,
As they suffocate our dreams with greed and empty air.

",False,,,,48

Here's a set of lyrics in the style of Roger Waters,­ a rant against the British government:

**Verse 1**
In the shadow of the crown, a lie is born each day 
A tale of freedom sold to the highest bidder's sway 
The streets are paved with greed, the people just a tool 
To keep the fat cats fed and happy, in their velvet rule 

**Chorus**
Oh, Albion's shame, your leaders have betrayed 
Their promises were hollow, the future they've slayed 
We're drowning in a sea of debt and pain 
While they reap the rewards, we're left to bear the strain 

**Verse 2**
In Westminster's hallowed halls, corruption reigns supreme 
Self-serving hypocrites, pontificating on a dream 
The NHS,'they ravage like a cancer on the bone 
Leaving lives in ruin while they wine and dine at home 

**Chorus**
Oh, Albion's shame, your leaders have betrayed 
Their promises were hollow, the future they've slayed 
We're drowning in a sea of debt and pain 
While they reap the rewards, we're left to bear the strain 

**Bridge**
In the name of progress, our heritage laid waste 
Our culture's rich tapestry, unraveling thread by thread, replaced 
By soulless glass and steel, where hearts once beat as one  
The very fabric of our society is undone 

**Verse 3**
They peddle fear and division, an endless, cruel game 
Racism and xenophobia, their tools to maintain the flame 
Free speech, a distant memory, dissenters cast aside 
As Orwell's nightmares manifest, we're forced to step inside 

**Chorus**
Oh, Albion's shame, your leaders have betrayed 
Their promises were hollow, the future they've slayed 
We're drowning in a sea of debt and pain 
While they reap the rewards, we're left to bear the strain 

**Outro**
Will we rise up, refuse to be held down?
