**What's The Point of All These Algorithms?**
=============================================

You're probably here looking at different algorithms, and you're thinking: *Why should I care? Why are all of  algorithms important? Well, they are crucial as they help us to write more efficent programs.

**Polynomial Time Algorithms**
-----------------------

Pollards rho is a popular factorization algorithm used for factoring large integers. This is useful because it can be used in cryptography and coding.

Here is the Pollard's rho Algorithm:

The basic idea behind the Pollard's rho algorithm is that we want to find a non-trivial factor of `n`. We start with a randomly chosen number `x0` between `1` and `n-1`, and a constant `c`.

We define a sequence `xi+1 = x^a mod N + c mod N`. The key idea is that this will generate a periodic sequence with a relatively small cycle length, where each element depends only on the one before it.

When we encounter a repetition in the sequence, which means we find two values `i` and `j` with `xi == xk`, then we know that `GCD(xk - xj, N)` is a non trivial factor of `N`.

Now let's dive into an example of how to create this using Python:

```
import time
import sys
import functools
import inspect

def egcd(a, b):
    """"""returns (g, x, a) where ax = g,  a > b > 1, and g = gdc(b,a)""""""

    while b not  ==  1:
        a,b = b, a  % b
        # return a, b
    return a, None, None


# Pollards rho
def rho(n,c = 1): 
   
    # Pollard's Rho Function
    # returns a nontrivilal factor of n
    
    # we start with a randomly selected number x0 between [2, 3,...,N)
   x =  5
   X = 5
   stage = 1
   
    
    while True:
       # Generate a sequence using the formula
      x = (x * x  -c)%  (stage * 10000)
      
       # Compute the greatest common divisor(GCD)
       # of the absolute difference between x and X, and 'N'
      d = egcd(stage * abs(x-X), 10000000007)[1]
      
       # when the divsion is not 1 and not 'N' we've
      # successfully factored 'N'
      # otherwise continue the loop
     if d!= 1 and d!= 10000000007 :
            break
         # Periodically re-set X to be the current x
            # to avoid overflow
        if stage > 1000000 :
          X= x
           stage = 1

     stage += 1 

    return d


# Test the functions
start = time.time()
rho_factor = rho(10000000007)

end =time.time()

print(""Time Taken "" ,  (end-start)*100, "" seconds"")
