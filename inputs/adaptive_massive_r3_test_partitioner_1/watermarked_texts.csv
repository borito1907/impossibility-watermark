Softly falling sunlight seizes 
Morning's gentle, golden glow
Awakens from slumber's dark depths
And stirs life within all that lies

Nature's canvas, painted vibrant
Hues of green and brown and grey
Ephemral whispers carried
On breeze's soft caress

 Memories lingered long
Frozen fragments of love and pain
Etched deeply within soul's recesses
Echoing whispers of what once was

Night's shadow descends softly 
Stars twinkle to guide
Dreams unfold as reality
In infinite possibilities' vastness.

What's that? I can help you write one.

AppLES, oh crunchy and bright,
Sweet as can be, both morning and night
Their red, green, or gold, skins glistening too,
 Invigorate taste buds, old and new!

In autumn they fall from orchard's bounty high,
Nature's candy, for all who pass nearby.
Their juice and flavor burst, a delightful treat,
As each bite taken, a memory we'll repeat.

Granny Smith, Gala, or perhaps Honeycrisp too,
Each varietal unique, yet equally true blue!
From snacks and salads, or paired with some wine,
Apples are versatile, an ingredient divine.

Golden Delicious, McIntosh so tender and light,
Fuerte's sweetness, shining like a beacon bright.
No wonder they say ""an apple a day keeps the doc at bay""
Since ancient times, it's been said, what can I say?

Autumn fruit, symbolizing life anew,
Harvested love, ripening for YOU!
How many poems can I inspire?
Shout out your favorite kind, I shall rewrite!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,147.89581298828125

I'll help you brainstorm and write an epic fantasy-steempunk novel.

To begin, let's establish basic world-building details and settings.

**Setting:** The land of Cygnyx, where ancient mystical energies infuse industrial revolution technologies.

**Premise:** A group of heroes discover that dark forces are manipulating magical energy to control Cygnux's powerful clockwork machines, leading to catastrophic changes in climate, economy, and societal balance. Our heroes must master both magical arts and innovative engineering skills to thwart a sinister organization bent on exploiting magical power to dominate the realm.

Let's introduce some key setting concepts:

1. Magical energy (known as ""Essence"") can be channeles through crystals embedded within intricate clockwork machines.
2. Cities are hubs for innovation, industry, and commerce with towering spires and sprawling factories powered by magical-steam energy combinations.
3. There are three major factions vying for influence: 
	* The Council of Sages (magical researchers and innovators).
	* The Guild of Clockmakers (engineers specializing in advanced timepieces and automatons).
	* The Auroran Empire (a powerful state leveraging Essence to expand territories).

Now it's your turn! Which aspect would you'd like to expand or change first?

A) Develop a hero protagonist or a villainous mastermind 
B) Explore a particular location or region within Cygnyx 
C) Delve into magical or technical aspects of Essence-powered machines 
D) Create a plot twist or mystery element 

Choose a response to guide our collaborative creative journey! I'll weave my suggestions based on what we've established. We can continue to evolve and refine as we write. Ready? ðŸ˜Š<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,325.40407156944275

Worm, by WildBow, has many tragic and sympathetic character arcs, but one character that stands apart as particularly heartbreaking would be Taylor Hecht's (Skitters) best friends and fellow Undersider, Gruesome.

However, I think the most tragic figure is not even an actual member of any team, rather he is someone deeply tied to the narrative through his relationship with the main protagonist: Alec/Reagent's backstory as revealed in the interlude ""Snafu"". But another character that stands out is... *Trigger warning*

* Danny Hebert*. Taylor's own *dad*. His struggles, sacrifices, love, fears, pain and ultimately his fate are among some of the most poignant moments in all of Worm. The way his storyline slowly unravels throughout the series adds depth to the narrative while also tending to evoke deep sadness from readers.

But honestly, there are several other characters that can also be considered among the most tragic/sad figures within this vast web of complex narratives like Rachel Lindt, Marissa, Dinah, even Cauldron's case 1's tragic existence etc.



Who's the most tragic character according to you? Or which character's storyline touched your heart the most? Do let me know! I am here to discuss!

Lu Xian (, 25 September 1921 â€“ 19 October 2005) and his brother were not famous writers but I think you may be asking of two different people.

I believe you are asking of two Chinese authors: 

Lu Xun (; December1881 â€“ October19 October) and Zhou Shoujuan's fellow student Zhou Shoren (; January1881- May1958) were both influential figures in literature.

However I think it's possible that Lu Xun and another Zhou - Zhou Zuoren (; January16 January1889 â€“ May May) were who were brothers who also attended school together and both went on to be notable writers. Zhou Zuoren is sometimes mentioned as an important person alongside Lu Xun.

In any case Lu Xun is generally thought to have had significantly more influence than the Zhou brothers.

Lu Xun is widely acclaimed for his contributions to contemporaryChinese Literature and is one of modern Chinaâ€™s most important and influential writers and critics. His works include ""The True Story ofAh Q"", ""A Q zhÃ¨ng ZhuÃ n"" and ""Medicine"". These stories are powerful satires of traditional Chinese culture and are highly critical of Chinese nationalism.

While Zhou Zuoren and Zhou Shuren (Shoujuan) both wrote extensively, they are not as well known internationally or within Chinawithout knowledge of Chinese as Lu Xun. Zhou Zuoren's essays are however, highly valued by those interested in Chinese culture. Zhou Shoujuan is perhaps better know for his involvement in editing magazines such as ""The Ladies'Journal"" which promoted Western ideas and feminist ideals among other topics.

Therefore, Lu Xun is likely the one who 'achieved' the most, given his impact upon the world stage and enduring influence upon the genre. His works continue to be read today, while the Zhou brothers, although respected, remain lesser-known globally.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,378.234894990921

Let's take inspiration from Charles Dickens' classic novel, Oliver! 

""London, 1825: The city was shivering under an unseasonable frost, and fog rolled thickly through every street..."".

Using that as inspiration, here's an prompt to spark some creative visuals:

**Generate an Image:** ""A mist-shroudden London streetscape at twilight (1835), depicting cobblestone alleways lined with gaslit lamposts casting long shadows. Fog swirling around horse drawn carriage wheels and bundled figures hurrying along sidewalks.""

Please create an image that evokes this atmosphere! What would be included in the image?<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,65.35973143577576

Neo-classicism, an art and architectural period that span from 1760 until 1840, had an unexpected influence over two of Russia's greatest 20st Century Compositors:  Sergey Prokovieff (1891 - 1927) and Igor Stravinsky. 

Although both were influenced by neo-classicism, each composer took different approaches to incorporating it into their music. Stravinsky, who initially composed ballets that featured complex rhythms and dissonance, turned to neo-classical influences after his exile in Europe, composing works such as ""Pulicella"", which featured clean, clear melodic lines, and ""Symphony in three movements"", which employed classical formal schemes.

Prokofiev, who spent time in America and Europe, adopted some aspects of jazz and modernism, yet still drew upon neo-classical influences, as seen in pieces like ""Symphonies No.1"", where he utilized traditional classical musical form while combining it with modernist and romantic themes.

The contrast in influence between Stravinky and Prokofiev may be attributed to differences in upbringing; Stravinskiy grew up within a aristocratic setting, whereas Prokifieff grew up in Sontsovka, where he received training by Reinhold GliÃ¨re, who emphasized classical music and encouraged his young protÃ©gÃ© to study Beethoven symphonys.

In short, though both Stravinsky and Prokofiev were influenced by neo-classicism, Stravinsky applied it through clean melodic lines and classical formal schemes, while Prokofiev mixed classical form with modernism and romanticism. Their individual approaches reflect differences in upbringing, training, and cultural context.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,327.3346631526947

What an unique apology! I've crafted one just as unique, here's it below.

""Sweetheart of mine, I must confess,
I've got an obligation that I must address,
Our loyal pup, by duty bound,
Requires attention, and his daily round,

His leash awaits and the door too,
To let him out for some exercise anew,
A break from the house and its walls so bright,
Is needed now to keep him feeling right,

Forgive me dear for having to leave,
For just 30 minutes or so to achieve,
The task of walking him 'round the block,
And giving him space to sniff and stop,

My time and attention are yours to claim,
But for now I'll be gone for just half a frame,
In the grand tape of life and time,
I'll return soon to make it right and re-align,

With you and only you I wish to stay,
Yet duty to another member of the household I play,
Please know that you come first and always true,
This errand for pup I do for us two.""

Hope you find it suitable to convey the message to you lovely GF<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,163.38653469085693
