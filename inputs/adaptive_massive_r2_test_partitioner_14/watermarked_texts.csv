I think I can help you identify StarFire.

You're probably thinking of one of two possible versions of StarFire, as there are different ones from different universers and series.

1) **Teen Titans' StarFire**: StarFire (real name Kori Anders) is an alien superhero in the Teen Titans franchise, which includes animated TV shows, such as the popular 2003-2006 animated series, and various other forms of media, like the original 2005-2008 animated series ""Teen Titans"" and the more recent 2020-present animated series ""Teen Titans Go!"".

In the Teen Titans series, she's an extrajudicial member, originating from the distant alien kingdom known as the Planet of the alien race, theTamarans. Starfire possesses superhuman abilities such as flight, energy blasts, and superhuman strength due to the unique properties of the planet's sun and atmosphere.

2) **DC Comics' Starfire** : There might also be the possibility that you could be looking for the character named Starfire (Kory Anders) that was first appeared in the New Teen Titans Vol. 3, No. 29 (March 1983). This StarFire is part of DC Comic Universe, created by the legendary team Marv Wolfman (writer) and the great Georges Pérez (artist).

This StarFire is an alien princess, an ambassador of the alien planet of the alien people, theTamaran, and is gifted with extraordinary physical capabilities, including superhuman agility, durability, and super-heuristic senses - all due to her alien physiology adapting to the planet Tamaran's intense sunlight.

Please let me know if any of these versions sound familiar or whether you need more clarification! I'd be happy to help!<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,377.3924078941345

MUV (Military Use Vehicle)-Lu (Unmotional Voice) - an anime that explores themes of time loops, parallel universises, and human emotion.

After researching, I found that MUV series, particularly MUV: Unlimited, Extra, and Alternative are known for exploring various themes related to:

**Human Emotion:** The series emphasizes that emotions are what make life valuable. It stresses the importance of experiencing emotions deeply as a key aspect of being human. 

**Existential Risk:** The MUV franchise also touches upon existential risks posed by advanced technologies that can destroy or severely impact societies worldwide.

**Parallel Universes, Time Looping:** The narrative employs these concepts extensively throughout its storyline. These themes allow creators Takeda Hiroyuki (author of novel) & âge (developer company) to examine multiple scenarios where different versions our main character exist across different realities.

The central message of Alternative specifically seems focused around:

* The consequences and costs associated with making tough decisions when faced life altering situations,
* Overcoming personal trauma through perseverance 
and ultimately learning from experiences so one might better navigate similar challenges going forward.

The Alternative arc aims at providing more definitive resolution regarding some major mysteries while still leaving room open enough interpretation amongst viewers.

Spanish verbs can be conjugateed (modified) according many different criteria, resulting hundreds of possible conjugates.

To give you an idea, here are just few of many conjugates Spanish verb can take: tense (present, imperfect, future, etc.), mood (indicative, subjunctive, conditional), person and number (I, you, he/she/it, etc. singular/plural), and even some other subtleties.

Let's assume a ""complete"" conjugation includes every combination these aspects, which results:

* Present tense: six conjugations (e.g., habl-o, hablas, habl-a, hablam-os, hablá-is, hablan)
* Imperfect tense: six conjugations
* Preterite tense: six conjugations
* Pluperfect tense: six conjugations
* Subjunctive present tense: four conjugations (habl-e, habl-es, habl-e, hable-mos)
* Subjunctive imperfect tense: four conjugations
* Future tense: six conjugations
* Potential/Conditional tense: six conjugations

Adding up the conjugations across these basic ones, that's at least:
6 + (5 x six per each other tense/mood combination). This totals over fifty conjugations per Spanish regular verb.

So, approximately 53 conjugations per Spanish regular verb.

Keep in mind this may be oversimplifying - there may also be other specialized conjugations and nuances, especially when it comes to certain verbs with specific patterns, as well as passive and progressive conjugations<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,336.533399105072

To generate split times, I'll assume you're looking at 1km splits and that you've specified slightly negative split, which means you'll be running faster as you approach closer and closer until finishing.

Assume that there are 5 splits of a 2 kilometer segment. To calculate each one of them, I have taken 36 minutes and 50 seconds (which gives us a total of 2218.3 meters for every 2 kilometers) as a baseline time and subtracted about a couple seconds off it for each subsequent interval. This should give a slight overall improvement over time.

Here's a possible breakdown:

* Splits: (2k): (00:07:21)

Yummy ribs! I've got you sorted! 

To achieve fall-off-boned, tender, and flavorful ribs, here's an easy step by step approach using oven-roasted technique.

**Ingredients:**
4 kg pork rib slats (adult rams or racks of ribs)
2.5 ml black pepper
1.25 g paprika
1.25 g cayenne pepper (adjustable for desired heat level)
2.5 g sea salt
60g dry rub mix (your favorite or homemade)
30 ml BBQ sauce (your preferred type and taste)

**Preparation steps:**

1. **Preheating:** Preheat your oven to **150°C**.
2. **Ribs preparation:**
Remove membrane from the back side of the ribs.
3. **Season with dry rub:**
In a bowl, combine paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and sea salt. Mix thoroughly.
Rub the spice blend generously into both sides of the ribs.
4. **Initial roasting:**
Place the ribs on an open baking sheet or broiler lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Roast for **2 hours** and **30 minutes**, uncovered, until they reach an internal temperature of **70°C**.
Flip them halfway through this time frame.
6. **BBQ glaze application:**
While still hot, gently remove the ribs and place them in a large container or ziplock bag. Pour the BBQ sauce directly onto the ribs, making sure each one gets coated. Seal the container or bag and let it rest for about **30 minutes** to allow flavors to develop.
8. **Final roasting:**
Put the sauce-covered ribs on a clean baking sheet or grill mat.
Roast for another **15-20 minutes** or until the internal temperature reaches **85°C**.
Keep an eye on them for even browning and possible chipping of meat at the end of the process.
8. **Letting it rest and serving:**
Allow the ribs to sit for **30 minutes** prior to cutting and serving.<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,561.6614181995392

What an exciting challenge! 

Introducing... **Mighty Mike** (Epic Rarity)

**Card Details:**
Type: Champion
Arena: 4 - 8
Elixir: 5
Description: The world's greatest darter, turned Clash Royale champion. Mighty Mike brings precision and power to destroy enemy towers.

**Statistics:**

* Health: Medium-Hard (similar to Prince or Hog Riders)
* Speed: Medium
* Target: Buildings
* Deployment: Air and Ground units

**Attack/Behavior:**

* Mighty Mike charges forward with incredible speed and accuracy, targeting enemy Towers.
* When he hits a target building, he unleashes an area damage effect, dealing moderate damage (about half of a Lightning spell) to buildings within a radius.
* As he approaches a target Tower, his darts glow bright red, increasing his damage dealt to that tower by about double for each subsequent hit.
* Mighty Mike can be distracted and stunned, causing him to lose some momentum and reducing his damage.

**Special Abilities:**

1. *Dart Shot* (passive): Mighty Mike occasionally shoots special darts that bounce between two buildings, dealing additional minor damage.
2. *Finish Line Frenzy* (ability): Activate this ability when Mighty Mike nears a target tower. It grants him an extra burst of energy, allowing him to dash faster and unleash an ultimate area damage blast, destroying any remaining health points on that tower.

**Counters and Synergies:**

* Countercards: Mega-Minion, Golem, and other high HP units can effectively counter Mighty Mike.
* Synergizes well with: Royal Hogs, Gobs, and other fast-moving units that can create distractions while Mighty Mike closes in on a target tower.

**Visual and Animations:**

* Mighty Mike wears a sleek, modern darts-inspired costume with a golden dart-like design element.
* Upon spawning, he tosses a single dart that lands with a satisfying sound effect.
* As he charges, he emits a trail of sparkles and faint darts, emphasizing his accuracy and deadly precision.
* During Finish Line Frenzy, the animation changes to a dramatic, high-energy display with flashing darts, explosions, and a triumphant cry from Mighty Mike himself!

Overall, Mighty Mike would be a unique addition to Clash Royale, offering a mix of precision, area damage, and crowd control capabilities that make him both a threat to opponents and a great asset for those who play him correctly!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,759.1867277622223

Creating sourdought from scatch can be an exciting and rewarding experience, and I'll be glad help you through it! 

**Day 1: Create The Spongy Environment**
 
1) **Initial Mix**: Combine half-cup of flour with half a cup of water (room temperature) in a clean glass jar or plastic bowl. Stir until smooth, then let sit for about twenty-four to forty-eight hours. It's essential to use filtered water because chlorinated tap water may slow down the fermentation process. Room temperature should ideally range between sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit to eighty-one degrees Fahrenheit.

2) **First Feed (After twenty-four to forty-eight hours)**: Discard half of your mixture and add half of fresh flour and half a cup of water to create a uniform paste again.
 
3) **Second Feed (Twenty-four hours post-first feed)**: Discard half of your starter once more and mix half-cup of flour and half cup of water to replace what was discarded. Repeat every day for six days straight.

4) **Observe and Adapt (Days one to seven)**: Watch over the mixture daily to observe any bubbles forming and an increase in froth which signals that fermentation is progressing well. You may need to adjust feeding time based on environmental factors.

5) **Maturity Test (After seventh day)**: Perform float test by gently placing some of the mixture into a glass of water - mature sourdough floats while immature ones drop.

6) **Final Feed and Transfer (Once mature)**: Upon maturity, you can store sourdough at room temperature in refrigerator and maintain by regular feeds every week or even freeze for long term storage. Before storing, perform final feeds and allow to rest before transferring to desired location.

7) **Maintenance and Usage**: To keep sourdough healthy, you need to ""feed"" (refresh and replenish) once every week by repeating steps two to four mentioned above. Now you're all set to make sourdough recipes! 

The entire process might seem complex initially but trust me, making sourdough from scratch gets easier and faster each time! Don't get discouraged by small failures - they are part of the journey! Best of luck! Would you like any recipe suggestions now that you've got sour dough started? Or perhaps you need clarification regarding any of the steps listed above?

**Sand, Sweat, and Steel: The Battle of Titans**.

**Caesar's Arena, Rome - 79 AD**.

Two titanesque figures stood at opposite ends of an arena, each radiates an unyieldable conviction that they were destined to emerge victorious. Their armor reflected sunlight as it danced upon the intricately crafted steel and leather designs that adorned their bodies. These were not ordinary warriors but two of the greatest champions in all the Roman Empire's storied history. 

At one side was **Flavius**, a towering mass of muscles and fury. His nickname ""The Storm"" had not only derived from his unpredictable behavior on the battlefield but also his ferocity. He wielded a massive scutum shield and a longsword that shimmered ominously against the bright sun. His armor bore symbols of his many victories - golden etchings of lions and wolves signifying the ferocious beast he claimed to embody in every fight.

Facing him, across the vast exuberant crowd that filled the stands, was **Titanius**, a man of similar build but contrasting demeanor. Known as ""The Titan,"" Titanius exuded confidence and calm. His armor glittered with gems and small trophies collected over years of battles in which he remained unbeathed. Unlike Flavius, he favored agility over brute force, carrying a smaller buckler and a rapier that sparkled as he twirled it playfully. His nickname spoke for itself - he fought as a living embodiment of myth and legend, his prowess unparalleled.

As both fighters approached the center of the arena, a chilling roar erupted from the crowd, a mix of cheers, curses, and prayers. The air thickened not only through anticipation but a sense of dread. This duel between two champions of unyielding skill and arrogance could only be resolved by death.

As they faced off, Flavius let a cold smile spread across his weathered face. ""This day,"" he declared, voice echoing across the silent moment before chaos ensued, ""will mark the last time your name is whispered among us.""

Titanius merely raised an amused eyebrow, his expression a perfect blend of disdain and curiosity. ""Many have fallen to your brutality,"" he said calmly. ""Will you find your own demise at my hand today?""

With a signal from a distant official, a blaring trumpet marked the commencement of the duel. The crowd exploded into frenzy as Flavius charged forward first, shield held high and sword flashing. His strategy relied heavily on intimidation and sheer power. Each step thundered against the ground as he sought to crush his opponent underneath his shield.

However, his adversary did not budge. Instead, he danced lightly to his left, dodging Flavius' clumsy but powerful swing by a fraction of a second. As Flavius recovered from his momentum, he exposed himself momentarily. Seizing this window of opportunity, Titanius lunge forward, his rapier weaving a path of precision strikes that forced Flavius onto the defensive.

Back and forth they exchanged strikes and parried each other's attacks, each seeking a weakness in the other's form. Flavius' brute strength began to wear down as fatigue set in, his swings becoming slower yet still deadly. On contrast, Titanius moved as gracefully as a dancer even as sweat streamed down his forehead and armor began to show scratches and scars of its own.

Then came the pivotal moment when Flavius attempted a desperate gambit. Enraged by his inability to land a single blow that could dent Titanius, he hurled his shield at his adversary, then leaped after it. It might have worked against lesser opponents, but not against a master of evasion like Titanius.

Dodge and counterattack happened almost too fast for human comprehension. The shield sailed harmlessly over Titanius's shoulder while he landed a critical hit directly into the opening left by Flavius's aggressive gamble.

The sound that filled Caesar's arena that day - a mixture of blood-curdling cry and stunned disbelief - remains legendary. Flavius collapsed to his knees, his sword slipping away as his body crumbled. The once mighty champion now clung desperately to life as his wounds poured red streams that painted the dusty arena floor. 

Titanius stood tall over the dying form, his rapier trembling lightly as if it yearned to deliver another stroke. Yet he refrained, a silent respect flicking across his gaze towards the fallen fighter.

""I expected better,"" Titanius said softly, his tone a stark contrast to the boisterous celebration that erupted across the stands.

As Flavius's body went limp, signaling the end, a solemnity enveloped the arena for an ephemeral moment. Then it gave way to a frenzied cheer. They celebrated not",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,2505.6515102386475

Duck fillet can be prepared using several methods, but oven roasts bring forth unique flavors and textures when executed correctly.

**Basic Steps:**
1\. **Preparation**: 
Prep duck by scoring fat layer (in criss-cross pattern) or removing it. This helps the duck cook better and prevents over-basting with melted fats.
Pat dry the duck using a clean towel before placing it on baking tray lined with foil.
2\. **Seasoning**:
Add your seasonings of choice. You can add herbs and spices directly to the meat and/or make marinade sauce. Make incursions into the scored areas as you spread the seasonings. This will help infuse the flavors deep in the flesh for an aromatic taste.
3\.  **Cooking**: 
Place the baking sheet into preheated oven at medium-low temperatures ranging from about \(325°F -375°F\). Cooking at this heat ensures that both the internal temperature reaches the required value without churning the exterior too quickly. Cook until the internal temperature reads \(140°F \)- \(150°F\).
4\. **Serving**: 
Let duck rest at least five minutes after removing it from the oven. Slice the breast thinly against grain and enjoy.

**Timing Guidelines:**

* **Medium-rare:** \(8 -10\) minutes per pound
*   **Well-done:** \(14-16\) minutes per pound<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,276.6712987422943

You're asking an important cultural reference! 

Marmite's arch-n nemisis... just kddi g, sort of.

No, but srsly,  Marmite and vegamite are both spreads that are popular among different groups. Marmite is a British spread while Vegemite has its origins in Australia.

Vegemite (not Vegenite) - it's a dark brown paste spread that's commonly eaten by the Aussies (people from Australia), New Zealanders, as well as some other countries.

The taste can be described as salty or umami (a Japanese word that roughly translates to 'fifth taste,' which goes along with sweet sour salty as well as the fifth one). It's usually spread thinly over slices of plain bread, then topped w/ cheese, egg, or even tomatoes.

However, it's worth noting: you either enjoy it or you do not; there aren't many middle ground takers here - most who've tried will tell you they either hate it or simply adore it<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,164.80176520347595
