Here are the lyrics to Lady Gaga's iconic song ""Poker Face"":

Verse 1:
I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas, please 
Fold 'em,'talk to me go fish-right now and lose me 
My party poker face (p-p-p-poker face) 
Raise it high, hide your tell-tell signs and cheque 

Chorus:
Can't read my, can't read my 
No he can't read my poker face 
(P-p-p-poker face, p-p-p-poker face) 

Verse 2:
Russian roulette is not the same without 
A bullet in the middle of the game (Oh-oh-oh) 
It's no fun to play if you're not gonna pay 
And I'll raise it high, high stakes tonight 

Chorus:
Can't read my, can't read my 
No he can't read my poker face 
(P-p-p-poker face, p-p-p-poker face)

Bridge:
Mum-mum-mum-mah 
Mum-mum-mum-mah 
(Mum-mum-mum-mah) 
(Raise it high) 

Chorus:
Can't read my, can't read my 
No he can't read my poker face 
(P-p-p-poker face, p-p-p-poker face)

Outro:
P-p-p-p-poker face, p-p-p-p-poker face 
(P-p-p-p-poker face)

I hope that helps!",True,2,"5,2",True,10
