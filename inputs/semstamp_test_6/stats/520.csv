Flashlights ain't flashing', maybe it's them sirens,
No, no, no, it's just the flashing lights.

This the theme song for the crash test,
Dummies in the back, just sacrificial lambs,
They say the captain goes down with the ship,
But I guess that's why they call me Captain Crash,

Crash at the bank, crash at the store,
Crash with your girl, then you wanna score,
Then you want more, then you want less,
Flashlights,'t flashing, maybe it's them sirens,

Now I'm walking around,'t know where I'm going,
Tryna get my mind off that certain somebody,
But I'm still trying to find that somebody else,
And I'm not saying it's your fault,'t sayin' it's mine,
It's ours,'t nobody else's,

Flashlights, flashing,'t maybe it's them sirens,
Maybe it's the police, maybe it's the paparazzi,
Either way,'t no escaping, can't nobody save me,
Flashlights, flashing, maybe it's them sirens,

The roads that we roam,'t no highway,
Mental institution, ain't no vacation,
Got my own ghostwriters, got my own engineers,
Got my own best man, got my own worst enemies,

Cousins on the payroll, they don't even get it,
Fresh out the kitchen, but they still can't whip it,
Got my own private club, got my own private jet,
Flashlights, flashing, maybe it's them sirens,

She was crying, calling me from Cleveland,
Said ""Yeezy, it's all my fault, I should've never..."".

Doctor's assistant, doctor's assistant,
Cuffed up, cuffed up, and now they're rushin' me,
In a cold sweat,'t know what I did,
Flashbacks, flashbacks, flashes of us,
Maybe it's them sirens, maybe it's them lights,
Strobe lights, strobe lights, or was it the camera flashes?

Fresh out the box, extra crispy,
Hundred thousand dollar car, ain't nobody else driving,
Sunglasses on, police watchin',
Think they after me, think they after my riches,

I'm 100 miles per hour, fast lane,
Paparazzi trying to get a photo,
My visor down, my helmet on,
Flashlights, flashing, maybe it's them sirens,

Paparazzi, they get annoying,
Flashed a picture of her and her new beau,
Now the tabloids saying that I'm stalking her,
I could never do that, at least not yet,

Got a lot of people who would die for me,
I got a lot of people who would kill for me too,
Got a lot of people who would die for me,
I got a lot of people who would kill for me too,
