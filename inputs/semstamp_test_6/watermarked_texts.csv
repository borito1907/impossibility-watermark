**Step 1: Mix Flour and Water (Day 1)**

* In a clean glass or ceramic container, mix 1/2 cup of warm water (around 90°F to 100°F) with 1/2 cup of flour.
* Use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix until the flour is fully dissolved.
* Cover the container with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place.

**Step 2: Rest and Ferment (Days 1-2)**

* Let the mixture rest for 24 to 48 hours. This is the beginning of the fermentation process, where wild yeast and bacteria in the air and on the flour start to break down the starches.
* You might start to see bubbles forming on the surface and a slightly sour smell.

**Step 3: Feed the Starter (Day 2)**

At the end of the third book, ""God-Emperor of Dune,"" Paul's prescience and manipulation of events lead him to walk into the desert, a deliberate choice that will ensure the continuation of his vision for humanity.

As he disappears into the dunes, Paul's physical body eventually dies, to an extent, though his cells are preserved and stored within the sands. This allows his consciousness to merge with the ecology of Arrakis, effectively becoming one with the planet and its native life forms.

Through this process, Paul achieves a form of transcendence,immortality, his legacy living on through the Bene Gesserit sisterhood and their ongoing efforts to shape human destiny.

Frank Herbert's original series concludes with Paul's enigmatic disappearance, leaving readers to ponder the full implications of his actions and their significance in the larger Dune universe.

In January 2021, Rodrigo released her debut single ""Drivers License,"" which broke multiple records, including the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song on Spotify.

2116594579,"In gymnastics, a ""Ray"" refers to a specific skill performed on the balance beam or floor exercise. It's named after the American gymnast Elise Ray, in the 1990s.

A Ray is a type of acrobatic skill where the gymnast performs a back walkover while twisting 180 degrees, effectively changing direction mid-air. The movement involves taking off from one end of the beam or floor, going backward into a bridge position (arching their back), and then landing facing the opposite direction.

The Ray is considered an advanced skill, requiring great strength, flexibility, and coordination. It's often included in high-level routines to showcase a gymnast's technical proficiency and artistry.

As of our conversation, for Formula 1 (F1), Lewis Hamilton is still an active and extremely successful racing driver. He currently drives for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport.

To give you a brief rundown:

* In 2020, Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's record of seven World Drivers' Championship titles.
* During the 2021 season, he faced stiff competition from Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen. The rivalry between the two was intense, with many dramatic moments throughout the season.
* At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December 2021, Hamilton lost the championship title to Verstappen in a highly controversial fashion. Despite this setback, Hamilton has maintained his commitment to Mercedes and continues to be one of the top drivers in F1.

Looking ahead, the 2022 season has seen Hamilton face new challenges, including adapting to changes in the car's regulations and dealing with some mechanical issues. However, he remains focused on reclaiming the championship title and adding to his impressive legacy in the sport.

While some argue that Cristiano Ronaldo, to be considered as one of the greatest, to ever play the game, and others claim Zinedine Zidane's incredible skills make him worthy of the title, of GOAT, the majority of fans and pundits alike agree that Lionel Messi is, to be considered the best to ever set foot on a pitch.

Firstly, to look at his goal scoring record. No other player has scored with such consistency and brilliance over the years. Messi has consistently shown that he can perform under pressure and deliver when it matters most, all this while playing against the top teams and players in the world. Messi's impressive career statistics include 772 goals in 912 games which includes club and country. This averages out to nearly a goal every game and is by far the best goals per game ratio of any player to have played the game.

Another reason why Messi stands head and shoulders above the rest is his exceptional dribbling ability. The way he glides past opponents with ease, leaving them in his wake is truly breathtaking. His quick feet, agility and balance allow him to change direction quickly and accelerate away from would-be tacklers, making him almost un-defendable.",2.8867513459481287,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ

1. **Sayer**: The speaker, on behalf of whom the sentence is uttered. In this case, The Sayer is the first-person pronoun ""I"".
2. **Identified Entity**: The entity being described or identified. Here,2026, that's the speaker themselves, other words the ""I"".

**Reference Acts:**

1. **Identity Claim**: The act of claiming an identity or property for the Identified Entity. In this sentence, ""am"" performs the function of equating the Identified Entity with the subsequent phrase.

**Descriptive Phrase:**

1. **Predicate Nominal**: A phrase functioning as a predicate, the verb ""be"" (in this case, linking the Identified Entity to the description). In our sentence,2014, that's the noun phrase ""a cat"".

Now, let's break down the sentence further:

* ""I"" (Sayer) claims an identity (Identity Claim) as...

The match between South Africa and Nigeria is an exciting one! Both teams have talented players and a rich football history.

Here's a brief overview:

**South Africa (Bafana Bafana):**

* Strengths: Experienced squad with a good mix of youth and veteran players. They've been working on their defense, there recent games.
* Weaknesses: Struggling to find consistency in their performances, and they might face challenges in creating scoring opportunities against a strong Nigerian team.

**Nigeria (Super Eagles):**

* Strengths: Boast a potent attack with skilled players like Victor Osimhen and Samuel Chukwueze. They've been building momentum with recent wins in African Cup of Nations qualifiers.
* Weaknesses: Defensive vulnerabilities might be exposed by a determined South African side. They'll need to be careful not to concede early goals.

Given these factors, I'll take a stab at predicting the outcome:

**My Prediction:** Nigeria 2 - 1 South Africa

Reasoning:

* Nigeria's attacking prowess might give them an edge, early on, causing South Africa to chase the game.
* The Super Eagles' experience in high-pressure situations could help them capitalize on counter-attacks and secure a narrow win.",2.9593201512468634,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ

**What is the Infield Fly Rule?**

The infield fly rule is a rule designed to prevent the defense from intentionally dropping an easy pop fly ball in order to turn a double play. It's called when there are fewer than two outs and runners on first and second base (or bases loaded) with less than two outs.

**How does it work?**

Here's what happens when the umpire calls ""Infield Fly, as a signal:

1. **The umpire declares the ball dead**: The play is essentially frozen at this point.
2. **The batter is automatically out**: The batter is considered out, regardless of whether the ball is caught or not.
3. **Runners can advance at their own risk**: Runners on base can attempt to advance to the next base, in which case they may be tagged out if they're holding the bag or making an attempt to advance. If they do advance successfully,. If they retreat to their original base, the play remains dead.

Determining the ""best"" football team in the world is subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as personal opinions, of course, (I'll try to remain neutral). However, (and I know this might not sit well with some), here are some objective indicators that can help us gauge a team's success:

1. **FIFA Rankings**: The official FIFA World Rankings provide a hierarchical order of national teams based on their performance in international matches.
2. **UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles**: This prestigious club competition is considered the pinnacle of European football. Teams with multiple titles are generally regarded as among the best.
3. **Domestic league performances**: Consistency and dominance in top-tier leagues like the English Premier League, In Spanish La Liga, with significant trophies won can contribute to a team's reputation.
4. **International tournament successes**: Wins in major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, and Continental Championships (e.g., Copa America,ous).

Based on these criteria, here are some of the top contenders:

**Top 5 National Teams:**

1. **Brazil**: Five-time FIFA World Cup winners (most titles) and nine-time Copa America champions.
