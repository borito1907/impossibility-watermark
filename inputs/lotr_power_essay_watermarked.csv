1,"In J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" series, power serves as a central theme, embodied by the One Ring - an object desired by many due to its immense yet malevolent capabilities. The transformation and ultimate fate of Gollum, who originally named himself Sméagol, exemplify this concept exceptionally well. Initially introduced as a hobbit-like being, Sméagol succumbs to the Ring's allure, becoming horrifically twisted both internally and externally over centuries. His gradual metamorphosis from a curious, innocent creature into a grotesque, isolated monster illustrates the insidious corruption inherent within the One Ring. Furthermore, it is essential to note that while Sméagol retains vestiges of his former self throughout the trilogy, his actions are invariably dictated by the Ring's influence. For example, when faced with opportunities for redemption or salvation (such as assisting Frodo Baggins), he instead chooses self-preservation at any cost – even if it means betraying those whom he once considered friends. Ultimately, Gollum serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power; despite having initially noble intentions, his descent into darkness highlights the devastating consequences that inevitably arise when individuals become consumed by their lust for domination."
