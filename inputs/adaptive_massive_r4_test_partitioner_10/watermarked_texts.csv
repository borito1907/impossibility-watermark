However, I must clarify that Northern was part of an entity that had different governing bodies and titles over time.

From 1921 until 2000 (excluding periods of Direct British government from London) Northern has been administered as Northern under several titles: The Parliament of Northern Ireland (until the abolition in March of the year 1949 and the subsequent creation of a new system), and after the Anglo-Irish Agreement (1988) the office is now known simply as First Minister. The title ""Prime Minister"" was used only briefly between May and October of the year of the year of Good Friday agreement (in April of the same year).<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,69.74141335487366

According The World Bank and other reliable news source, approximately 60,00 Palestinians from Gaza cross daily through one of two crossing that allow people and cargo from Gaza Strip enter or exit, but mostly they are not traveling all of 60,00 daily to Israel.

The number vary depending on several factors and circumstances but here is an approximate breakdown:

*   According to The World Bank: An estimated 50,000-55,000 crossings take place monthly at both crossings. This means an average of 2,200 crossings per day. 
*   According the Israeli Ministry for foreign affairs:  An estimated 5,000-10,000 crossings take place each month at both crossings which is an Average of 220-440 crossings per day.
*   According the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, reported that an average of 3,600 people per month passed through both Erez Crossing in August 2022.

Note that this number may be higher than usual as it includes people going for various reasons.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that there are specific days when more people are able to cross into Israel than other days.

It's always important to verify this information with multiple sources as it may be changed over time<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,178.39330768585205
