1,"

The seasons wither and collapse 
    into one another 
a maddening cycle 
that defies all reason 
yet is reason itself 

the trees shed their skin like worn habits 
and stand as skeletons 
gaunt reminders of what has passed 
and what must come to pass 

in this flux we search for purchase 
for some still point where 
we might anchor our fragile 
sense of self 

but like the river that flows ceaselessly 
change courses through us 
reshaping the landscape of our souls 
rendering familiar contours unrecognizable 

in this disquiet we stumble 
through labyrinths of uncertainty 
 guided only by the whispers 
of a future yet unknown 

still we reach out desperate 
to grasp the hand of something solid 
a comfort that will not let go 
no matter how the currents shift 

yet it is in surrendering 
to the undertow of time 
that we find the hidden freedom 
to be remade anew.
