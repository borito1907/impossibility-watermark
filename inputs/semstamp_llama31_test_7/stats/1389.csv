Here is a non-rhyming poem:

The sun sets slowly over the ocean's waves 
A fiery ball of light sinking below the horizon 
Leaving behind a sky ablaze with hues of pink and gold 

The stars begin to twinkle like diamonds against the velvet blackness 
As night falls, the world takes on a softer tone 

In this quiet moment, worries fade away 
And for an instant, all is right with the world 

Silence envelops me, a soothing balm 
My heart rate slows, my breath deepens 

I feel at peace. 

",False,,,,1
2,"

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
A stillness that seeps into every pore 
The world is hushed, a quiet reverence 
As if the very earth is holding its breath 

Memories linger in the shadows 
Whispers of laughter, echoes of love 
Fragile moments suspended in time 
A delicate balance between past and present 

In this quiet hour, I find myself 
Lost in the depths of my own thoughts 
A maze of emotions, twisting and turning 
As I search for meaning, for purpose 

The darkness slowly begins to recede 
Light creeps back into the world 
Bringing with it the promise of new beginnings 
And the hope of a brighter tomorrow.

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city tonight 
The stars twinkle like diamonds scattered across the sky 
A lone car drives by, its headlights casting an arc of light on the deserted streets 

In this quiet moment, I find peace 
My thoughts wander to far-off places and memories long past 
The world outside recedes, and all that's left is the gentle hum of the universe 

The darkness presses in around me, but it's not oppressive 
It's a reminder of the infinite unknown that lies beyond our small lives 
I breathe deeply, feeling the air fill my lungs, and let go, releasing all worries and fears 

In this stillness, I am free.

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

The morning light creeps slowly over the horizon 
A warm glow that spreads across the sky 
Bringing with it a new day full of possibilities 
As the world stirs from its slumber

Nature awakens, and with it, the sounds of birdsong 
A gentle breeze rustling through leaves 
In the distance, a stream babbles and churns 
Its melodic voice weaving in and out of the silence 

In this moment, all feels right with the world 
Hope and promise stretch out before us like an open road 
The unknown beckons, and we step forward into its uncertainty 
Embracing whatever the day may bring.

",True,1,"7,2",True,8

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
As darkness slowly gives way to morning light 
The world is hushed, a quiet reverie 
A time for reflection and introspection 

 Memories stir in the stillness 
Forgotten moments rising to the surface 
Like ripples on a pond, they disturb the calm 
Reminding us of what's past 

In this peaceful atmosphere 
Thoughts untangle themselves from worries 
Concerns and fears slowly unravel 
As the heart begins to open up 

Nature awakens 
Birds take to the sky 
Their songs a gentle symphony 
As morning blooms into daybreak 

In these quiet hours, we find solace 
A refuge from life's chaos 
A chance to reconnect with our deepest selves 
And start anew.
