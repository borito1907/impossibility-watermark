Here's a short rap about toothpaste:

[Intro]
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell,
'Bout a hero in the morning, doing well,
It's not a superhero, but it's just as grand,
I'm talking 'bout toothpaste, the paste that's in demand,

[Verse 1]
Got my Colgate fresh, Crest on deck too,
I squeeze out a pea-sized dollop, and then I get new,
Minty freshness, whitening power, it's what I need,
My breath is fire, nobody can beat,
Cavity-free smile, that's what I achieve,
Toothpaste by my side, like a dental team,

[Chorus]
Toothpaste, toothpaste, keeping it real,
Cleaning my teeth with the daily feel,
Foam and fluoride, they do their part,
Giving me shine, that's where it starts,

[Verse 2]
From Sensodyne to Arm & Hammer too,
The paste I choose depends on my mood anew,
If I've eaten garlic or onions strong,
Tom's of Maine comes through, right where I belong,
Fresh flavors and styles for all,
Even for kids, there's Bubblelicious after all,

[Bridge]
When was the last time you checked your tube?

Spreadin' the love, throughout my dental bed,
A pea-sized amount, that's all I need,
Cleanin' between meals, takin' good care indeed,

Rinsin' with water, feelin' brand new,
Visitin' my dentist, regular check-ups key,
Got a healthy grin, from my heart to sea,

With a sparkling grin, confidence comes your way,
Keep on brushin', don't be slow,
