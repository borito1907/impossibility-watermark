Buddha might have his enlightenment vibes,

**Round 1 - Buddha**

Lincoln may have unified the land,
But I united the mind, took a different stand,
No guns or armies needed, just a quiet seat,
I showed the world the path to inner peace, can't be beat

My teachings of compassion, empathy, and kindness too,
Transcend borders and cultures, they're universal truth,
No need for politics, no need for fame,
 Inner peace is the goal, that's the Buddhist aim

Your top hat's high, but your ego's higher,
 Mine's low-key, like a lotus flower, wiser,
Freeing the mind is the greatest feat,
Not just freeing bodies, that's incomplete

**Round 2 - Abraham Lincoln**

Respect, Buddha, but let's get real,
When it came to action, I made the deals,
 Politicians fought me, but I stood tall,
 Signed the 13th Amendment, after all

 Your ""middle way"" may work for some,
 But in the face of oppression, it's not enough, son,
Sometimes it takes courage, passion, and drive,
To make a difference, you gotta take a stride

History remembers leaders who take a stand,
 Not just philosophers who sit on their hands,
 I changed the course, left a lasting mark,
 My legacy will live on, shining bright in the dark

**Round 2 - Buddha**

Mark my words, Abe, you may have power,
But without self-awareness, it's just an hour,
Fleeting and fragile, like a sandcastle wall,
Until the tide of time washes over all

True freedom comes from within, not from above,
 When you understand yourself, that's authentic love,
 The Four Noble Truths guide us on our way,
Suffering's inherent, until we change our gaze

Respect, Mr. President, but wisdom is key,
I've walked the path, to set humanity free,
From suffering and pain, I showed the way,
Through mindfulness and love, come what may

No need for swords or guns to make a change,
Compassion and kindness, that's the real range,
In the Four Noble Truths, I revealed the plan,
To end our sorrows, and take us to the promised land

**Round 2 - Abraham Lincoln**

Wisdom's great, but actions speak louder still,
I put my words into practice, against the hill,
Of oppression and injustice, I fought the fight,
Ending slavery, giving hope, shining light

Top hat on tight, I stood tall and strong,
Against secessionists, all day long,
Preserving the Union, was my main quest,
And when it came to compromise, I always passed the test

**Round 2 - Buddha**

Actions might be loud, but understanding's deep,
Insight and awareness, the only secrets I keep,
The middle path is where the truth resides,
Avoiding extremes, I walk with gentle strides

Your strength is admirable, but don't forget,
 Inner peace is key, before external fret,
Non-attachment, non-violence, these are my ways,
Emptiness and compassion, fill each passing day

**Round 3 - Abraham Lincoln**

A president's power comes from the people's trust,
Elected by the masses, to give 'em justice,
Accountability, that's the watchword here,
A leader must serve, and banish doubt and fear

Through Civil War's trials, my character shone bright,
Strong and steadfast, even in dark of night,
A better future born, from turmoil's strife,
That's the essence of leadership, that's the difference between life

**Round 3 - Buddha**

Trust's essential, yet impermanent things deceive,
 Politicians come and go, their legacies leave,
Ego and attachment blindside, no matter the position,
Wisdom sees beyond titles, to true intention

No permanence exists, like clouds that fade away,
My guidance stands firm, not subject to dismay,
Liberation from sorrow, through inner sight,
Frees from craving, frees from night

**The Final Verdict**

Both opponents delivered bars that stunned the floor,

Abraham Lincoln brought fire with his mighty roar,
Buddha countered with calm, illuminating more,
