**Title:** ""Secrets in the Shadows""

**Verse 1:**
I heard a whisper, a rumor so fine,
About the government and what they design,
Hidden agendas, lies and deceit,
Are we living in a world that's not what it seems?

About the truth that nobody knows (nobody)

 Shape-shifters lurkin', demons at the gate (gate)

From the JFK assassination to the flat earth is found (found)
 Aliens on Mars, government cover-ups galore (cover-ups)
