Here is a non-rhyming poem:

The morning light creeps slowly over the horizon 
Bringing with it the promise of a new day 
Soft and warm, it illuminates the landscape 
Awakening the world from its slumber 

 Memories linger in the shadows 
Faded echoes of moments past 
Whispers of love and laughter 
Forgotten scents that still linger 

In this fleeting moment, I am alive 
 Connected to the world around me 
A fragile balance between darkness and light 
Where the beauty of existence resides.

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a soft blanket over the city at night 
The stars twinkle like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse of space 
In this quiet hour, worries and fears seem to fade away 
Replaced by a sense of calm and clarity 

 Memories of the day's events replay in my mind 
 Conversations and moments that brought joy or stress 
As I reflect on all that has passed 
I let go of the things that no longer serve me 

In the stillness, I find a sense of peace 
A reminder that everything will be okay 
That even in chaos, there is beauty to be found 
And that tomorrow brings new opportunities to start anew.

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at night 
The stars shine bright in the dark canvas of sky 
A lone car drives down the deserted street 
Its headlights casting an eerie glow 

In this moment, all is still 
The world holds its breath, waiting for dawn 
The shadows stretch and twist on the walls 
As the darkness reigns supreme 

In the quiet hours, thoughts are free to roam 
Uncencumbered by the distractions of day 
The mind wanders, unmoored from reality 
Drifting on a sea of possibilities 

As the first light creeps over the horizon 
The silence begins to fade away 
The world stirs, shaking off the slumber 
And a new day slowly comes to life.

Here's a piece of free verse:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at dawn 
As night's shadows retreat before the rising light 
The stars fade, one by one, extinguished by morning's radiance 

 Memories of yesterday linger in the air 
Echoes of laughter and tears, moments forever suspended 
A lingering sense of longing that never quite dissipates 

The world stirs, slowly coming to life 
The sounds of traffic, the hum of machinery, the chatter of strangers 
Each sound a thread in the intricate tapestry of human experience 

In this moment, anything is possible 
The day unfolds like an unwritten book 
Awaiting the stories we will create, the choices we will make, the paths we will choose 

Let the silence be broken, let the words begin to flow 
For in the stillness, we find the courage to start anew.
