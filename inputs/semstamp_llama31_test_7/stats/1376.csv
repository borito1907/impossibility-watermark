Here's a non-rhyming poem I came up with:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city streets at night 
A heavy stillness that presses down on everything it touches 
The stars twinkle above, distant and unreachable 
As the world below holds its breath in anticipation of dawn 

Memories linger in the shadows, faint and ephemeral 
Echoes of laughter and tears, whispers of what could have been 
They seep into our souls, a slow-moving tide 
Shaping us, molding us, leaving their mark long after they're gone 

In the darkness, we find solace in the unknown 
A refuge from the demands and expectations of the day 
It's a time for reflection, for introspection 
A chance to recharge, to renew, to rediscover ourselves.

Here's a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at night 
A stillness that seeps into every pore, calming the soul 
The stars twinkle like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse 
As the world slows its frantic pace and succumbs to darkness 

In this quiet hour, thoughts unfold like petals of a flower 
 Memories long buried rise to the surface, tender and fragile 
Regrets and longing entwined with love and loss 
Echoes of what has been, whispers of what may be 

The world is full of mysteries waiting to be unraveled 
Unseen paths leading us through labyrinths of our own making 
And in the silence, we may just find the courage to explore 
To face the unknown and discover who we truly are.

Echoes of laughter, whispers of loved ones 
Fragile as smoke on the breeze, yet forever etched 
In the heart's deep well of remembrance 

In this quiet hour, I am free to roam 
Where shadows dance upon the walls, and moonlight streams 
My thoughts unravel, a tapestry of joy and sorrow 
Weaving a narrative of what it means to be alive.

And though the world outside may be chaotic, within 
There is calm, a sense of resolve.

Clarity dawns, a gentle light 
 Illuminating paths once shrouded in darkness

Disturbing the calm with their gentle lapping 
I am carried away by the tide of recollection 
To places both familiar and forgotten 

And when the dawn breaks, I am left to wonder 
At the mysteries that lie beneath the surface 
Of a world that is both beautiful and broken 
Full of stories waiting to be unearthed.
