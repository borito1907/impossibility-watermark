She traded her seat for a gas pump and some flair,
Runnin' a gas station on 8 Mile Road, with precision and care.

Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell,
'Bout the Iron Lady, doing business well,
In the D-Town streets, she's made her stand,
Running a gas station, with an iron hand,

Margaret Thatcher, the former PM, now servin' gas and more,
Her station's on the corner, of Woodward and 8 Mile shore,
She's still tough as nails, but now she's fillin' tanks,
Helping out the people, with a price that ain't too blank,

(Chorus)
Maggie T's Pumpin', gasoline and pride,
The toughest chick in town, where the Motor City thrives,
She may have been a leader, but now she's on the grind,
Gas 'n go, quick stop, Maggie's makin' it all shine.

Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell,
'Bout Maggie T, the Iron Lady, doing well,
She left the UK scene, and now she's in the D,
Running a gas station, you know what I mean, G.

She's pumping diesel, and unleaded too,
The Queen of the pump, got a price or two,
Regulated the market, with an iron hand,
Detroit drivers better not get on her bad land.

Yo, listen up, let me share a tale,
'Bout the Iron Lady, with a new prevail,
Margaret Thatcher, the former PM too,
Left the politics game, to pump some gas for you,

In Detroit city, where the streets are tough,
She's runnin' a filling station, gettin' it rough,
Ain't no one fresher, than Maggie T on the scene,
Fixin' flats and fillin' tanks like a queen,

Her motto's ""Thatcher's Fuel"" with a Union Jack high,
Gasoline and oil, she won't say goodbye,
She's got a sign that says ""Pay your own way"",
If you're lookin' for welfare, you'll have to go astray,

(Chorus)
Maggie's at the pump, she's the one you know,
Runnin' the show, as the gas flows,
Detroit style, with a British flair,
Thatcher's got the juice, so pull up and show care,

(Verse 2)
From unleaded to diesel, she's got the skill,
Fill 'er up or just a quick fill,
Coffee and snacks, to go with your trip,
But don't even think, 'bout askin' for a dip,

She's all business, no room for play,
Cut the red tape, every single day,
If you can't afford it, then don't come near,
'Cause Maggie's not here, to hold back tears,

(Bridge)
The Motor City, where the cars roam free,
Maggie's keepin' it real, as the boss of the energy,
No one messes, with her prices low,
She's still the same, Iron Lady in tow,

(Chorus)
Maggie's at the pump, she's the one you know,
Runnin' the show, as the gas flows,
Detroit style, with a British flair,
Thatcher's got the juice, so pull up and show care,

This British invasion, is takin' over town,
At Thatcher's Fuel Station, gas is wearin' the crown.",True,3,"7,2",True,5

 Runnin' a gas station, gettin' renowned,
In Detroit city, where the streets is tough,
She's pumpin' fuel, and servin' up enough,

Got her trusty pen and notebook by her side,
Calculatin' prices, makin' sure they won't divide,

She's still got that fire in her belly tight,
Telling customers, ""No more subsidies tonight!""

Yo, it's Maggie T, the Iron Lady of old,
Runnin' a gas station in Motown, stories untold,
Detroit's where she's at, with pumps and with pride,
Fuelin' up the cars, as the profits glide,

She's still got the steel in her eyes, no need to ask why,
As she handles the cash, with a firm goodbye,
Customers come and go, some think it's a joke,
But Thatcher's on the grind, ain't nobody gonna smoke,

Her politics may be tight, but her prices are right,
Regular, mid-grade, or premium, day and night,
She's got the deal of the century, you better believe,
Fill 'er up, and don't you leave,

(Chorus)

Gas and oil, she'll take care, 'til you slide,

She's still got the steel in her eyes,
But now she's wieldin' a pump and a smile so wise,
She's calculatin' prices, and crunchin' numbers too,
Making sure the profit margins are true blue,

The people of Detroit, they come from far and wide,
To fill up at Maggie's, where the gas is right inside,
They chat about politics, and the state of the game,
But Maggie keeps it real, no time for no lame claims to fame,

(Bridge)
From Downing Street to Eight Mile Road,
Thatcher's brought her leadership code,
 Disciplined and strong, she's runnin' the show,
Get your gas and go, before the competition grows!
