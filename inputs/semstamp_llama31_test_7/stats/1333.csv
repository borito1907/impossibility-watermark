in the city of lost things i find you again 
standing on the corner of 5th & shattered dreams 
your eyes like two hollowed-out saints 
watching me stumble through the streets 

i reach out to touch your skin 
but it's just a mirage, a heatwave 
refracting light from the pavement up 
where our bodies once collided 

like starlings on a telephone wire 
our conversations balance precarious 
one wrong move & we plummet 
into the silence that follows us home 

tonight i'll walk these streets alone 
haunted by the ghosts of us 
every streetlamp casting long shadows 
of what we had & what we've become 

the buildings loom above me 
empty monuments to what we built 
& tore down with our own hands 
now the only sound is the hum 
of loneliness in this desolate land 

yet still i search for you in crowds 
hoping to find a glimpse of what's left 
though even if i do, it won't be enough 
to revive what we killed 

still i reach out with every step 
my fingers brushing against air 
hoping to feel your warmth 
only finding more emptiness there.

the city was a mouth that swallowed me whole 
and then I was just another flavor on its tongue 
I tasted like smoke and yesterday's regret 

in the bars we made promises to strangers 
like offering our hearts as collateral 
for a night or two of temporary forgetting 
but when the morning came, we were just ghosts 
haunting the wreckage of last call 

your hands were full of stars and bruises 
my skin was a map of all the places 
you'd left your fingerprints 
we drove all night with the radio off 
listening for the sound of each other's heartbeat 

our love was an experiment 
conducted in secret 
under fluorescent lights 
it didn't always work 
but sometimes it did 

now the city is empty 
except for the sound 
of my own breathing 
and I am left 
to wonder what happened 
to the ghost I used to be.

strip malls and chain restaurants 
no one looks up from their phones 
to acknowledge my passing 

at night i dream of fire 
of burning down the places 
where love has left its mark 
on me like a scar 

but when i wake i'm still here 
in this body that holds all 
my mistakes, all my heartaches 
the sum total of everything 
i thought i knew about desire 

your name is still on my tongue 
like a ghost i keep trying 
to spit out but can't quite clear 
it clings to the roof of my mouth 
like the words we spoke once 
now gone silent as dust 

i wander these empty halls 
lit only by flickering screens 
searching for something to anchor 
myself to, some thread to cling 
to before the whole thing unravels 
and leaves me lost again in this sea.

the city folds its arms around me 
like a bad habit i've had since birth

each one telling a story i already know 

night air thins like a lovers kiss goodbye 
your lips still burning on my skin 
where did we last leave off 
on which corner, at what hour?

Here is a poem in the style of Richard Siken:

""the map i made of you""

in the cartography of my brain, 
you're a city i can never leave 
no matter how far i drive, no matter 
how many times i rewrite the roads 
i always end up back at your mouth 

your fingers tracing lines on my skin 
where rivers run into lakes where mountains 
meet the edge of my own private sea 
and i'm lost again in the depths of you 

sometimes i wonder if it's true what they say 
about hearts having a finite number 
of beats before they stop working altogether 
or if that's just something we tell ourselves 
to explain why love has an expiration date 
like milk or bread left out too long 

last night i dreamed we were still alive 
we danced under stars like confetti 
our hands slick with sweat and summer air 
and when the music stopped we were standing 
naked on the edge of a cliff staring out 
at nothing but our own uncertainty 

but even now as i look out this window 
watching snow erase every familiar landmark 
i know exactly where i am: right here 
beside you, knee to knee, 
even though you aren't.

Here is a poem I came up with, inspired by the style of Richard Siken:

""the anatomy of an exit""

i am still learning 
to navigate the geometry of your absence 
it's a city i've lived in all my life 
but suddenly every street sign points to goodbye 

your face is a rumor i'm trying to track down 
through alleys and dead ends 
only to find myself at the waterfront 
staring out at the sea like it's a bruise 

we were two magnets spinning wildly out of control 
repelling each other but never quite escaping 
that fatal attraction that brought us here 
to this precipice where we hover now 

there was a moment when love was possible 
when our bodies aligned like a rare eclipse 
and for an instant, everything made sense 
but like all things in motion, it couldn't last 

now i wander this empty city 
looking for the landmarks of what we had 
but they're either gone or obscured by time 
leaving me to piece together 
the fragmented topography of my heart 

in dreams, i still see your outline 
a shadow cast on a blank wall 
promising to meet you at the intersection 
of desire and surrender 
where the horizon stretches out 
like an uninvited guest

This poem tries to capture some of the themes and imagery common in Richard Siken's work, such as:

* Exploring the complexities of relationships and love through metaphors (e.g., ""geometry of your absence"", ""magnets spinning wildly out of control"")
* Using imagery from nature (e.g., ""waterfront"", ""sea"", ""bruise"") to describe emotions and experiences.

Here's a poem in the style of Richard Siken:

your fingers, they leave impressions on my skin 
like wet cement setting too quickly 
the city outside is a bruise that won't heal 
and we're just two kids making out in the broken glass 

of our lives, trying to find a way to be 
untethered from all this concrete sorrow 
but your eyes, they keep telling me to stay 
to take another drag off the burning wreckage of us 

in the darkness of your room, I find 
a makeshift peace, like an after-hours bar 
where we can drink ourselves numb and forget 
that we're just temporary inhabitants of these bodies 

but when you wrap your arms around me tight 
all the hurt of it, it comes rushing back 
like someone shouting my name through a megaphone 
reminding me that even love is just a form of damage 

in your touch, I feel the undertow 
pulling me under, where the water's dark and cool 
I want to drown with you, to lose myself completely 
because what else is there for us but this endless forgetting?

your name is a bruise on my tongue 
the words get stuck in my teeth 
and i have to push them out with force 
like a cough that refuses to leave 

your eyes were the color of old photographs 
faded and yellowed at the edges 
they looked like they'd been handled 
by too many careless hands 

i tried to hold onto your gaze 
but it slipped right through my fingers 
like sand or smoke or something else 
that can't be caught, no matter how hard i try 

your skin was warm as the pavement 
on a summer night after dark 
i pressed my cheek against it 
trying to absorb some of the heat 

you said ""let's go"" and we did 
driving down a highway lined with billboards 
that screamed our names and whispered lies 
we laughed like we knew better 

now i'm left with just this one thing 
your number scribbled on a napkin 
in handwriting that might not even be yours 
but i'll call it anyway, every night

you're just another stranger passing by 
lost in this sea of faces
