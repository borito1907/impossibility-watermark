Here's a poem in the style of Richard Siken, known for his emotive and evocative verse:

My hands are a map of your absence 
finger-shaped holes where you used to be 
the lines on my palms like rivers run dry 

in this parched country I've wandered 
searching for the taste of your lips 
finding instead the echo of your voice 
on the wind that stirs through abandoned places

sometimes I catch myself whispering 
your name into the void 
though I know it's just an excuse 
to hear something that sounds like love 

tonight I drove with all the windows down 
feeling the city unravel 
like a spool of twine unwinding 
as I whispered secrets to strangers' faces 

each face a reminder of yours 
ghostly features blurring together 
like the rain-soaked photographs 
I found in the alleyway dumpster 

yours is the only face I recall 
with precision and longing 
etched in sharp relief against 
the hazy contours of memory

""No One Knows the Name of This Road""

I woke up with your absence like a bruise 
on my skin, a tenderness that spreads 
from the memory of your mouth 
to the places where I still feel alive.

the city was a scar that wouldn't heal 
            over itself 
a bruise that kept getting 
           kicked around 
i found you in a crowd 
         where everyone wore their 
        sunglasses at night 

your eyes were a bruise 
      too but they fit mine 
perfectly we collided 
       like imperfect planets 
 orbiting our own disaster

sometimes i think about the 
 things i'd say to you if 
my words weren't a mess 
   of broken clockwork 
   rusted hinges 
  i want to be 
the only one who can 
 repair you 

but your silence is 
a blueprint i keep 
 trying to decode 
 like an equation 
with no solution 
in sight 

our love is a museum 
where artifacts are displayed 
behind glass cases 
and warnings are issued 
not to touch 
 do not breathe on this 
 delicate exhibit 

do not wake up 
from this reverie

""In the Museum of What We Used to Be""

We went to the museum of what we used to be,
where the air was thick with the weight of our mistakes.
