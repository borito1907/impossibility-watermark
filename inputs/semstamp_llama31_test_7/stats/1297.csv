Yo, listen up 'cause I'm about to take you deep,
Into the darkness of Pathos-2, where the horrors creep,
Frictional Games took us on a ride,
In SOMA, the underwater base, where the walls divide,

Between human and machine, the lines get blurred and gray,
I'm Simon Jarrett, just tryin' to survive the day,
My memories ain't what they seem, I'm filled with pain,
A brain scan's the only way to break the chain,

Got my trusty Omicron, it's my only friend,
But even that's got me wondering till the end,

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, 'cause I'm about to take you deep,
Into the depths of an underwater nightmare, where the darkness creep,
It's Pathos-II, a research facility, abandoned and cold,
Where the remnants of humanity's last hope, is growin' old,

See, SOMA's the game, where the truth is hard to find,
In this sci-fi horror, where the line between life and death is blurred on my mind,
I'm Simon Jarrett, just a regular guy, tryna survive,
But the Arkea virus got me thinkin', ""What's the point, I'm gonna thrive?""

[Intro]
Yo, listen up 'cause I'm about to spit some fire,
About a game that'll make you question your desire,
To play or not to play, that's the test,
In the underwater facility, where the horror's at its best.

(Intro)
Yo, it's been a minute since I dove into the deep,
Where the abyssal creatures creep and the darkness seeps,
Amnesia gave me nightmares, but this one's the worst,
Welcome to PATHOS-II, where horrors unfurl like a cursed verse.

Yo, listen up, 'cause I'm about to spit some fire,
'Bout a game that's dark, and will take you higher,
SOMA's the name, sci-fi horror's the claim,
Get ready for a ride that'll leave you feelin' insane.

(Verse)
Yo, listen up, 'cause I'm about to spit some fire,
'Bout a game that's off the chain, it's a sci-fi desire,
Soma's the name, and horror's the aim,
Underwater research facility, where the terror's not tamed,

I'm Simon Jarrett, just tryna survive,
Woke up from a coma, gotta stay alive,
These robots and monsters, they're all on my case,
Tryna take me down, leave me in this dark place,

Ark 2, the station, it's a creepy sight,
Abandoned and eerie, no end in sight,
The walls are cracked, the lights flicker dim,
I'm navigating through, trying not to succumb,

To the madness that's spreading, the decay and the rot,
My colleagues gone crazy, or so I've been told,
 Catherine Chun, she's my only guide,
Helping me unravel, the mysteries inside,

(Walkman sound effects)

Carl, he's the first one, who gets on my nerves,
Then there's Dr. Rodriguez, with her sinister swerves,
But the truth is shocking, the horror unfolds,
This underwater hellhole, where the sanity grows old,

(Bass drop)
I see the creatures, they're made of wires and steel,
The noise, it pierces, like a scream in my ear for real,
The atmosphere's tense, as I sneak around,
One wrong move, and I'm the main course, in this death trap town,

But still I push forward, through the darkness and fear,
Catherine's voice whispers, ""Simon, you're drawing near"",
To the secrets beneath, the true reason why,
They created these horrors, and watch the world ask why,

(Verse continues)
It's not just robots, but humans too,
Tormented by their own guilt, what they put the crew through,
Psychological terror, as much as physical pain,
A haunted house, where the ghosts all remain,

In the end it's just me, against the unknown,
Facing the evil, that lurks beneath the throne,
No happy ending, no heroes to be found,
Just an existential crisis, spinning round and round.

(Verse 1)
Yo, it's been three years since I descended into the deep,
 PATHOS-II, an underwater hellhole where the damned ones sleep,
Somas' the name, but sanity's the aim,
Tryna keep my grip on reality as the terrors rearrange,

My mind's a mess, like the cables in this base,
Dead bodies floatin', can't escape the gruesome pace,
A brain scan revealin' horrors unseen,
Terrorized by robots, and creatures so supreme,

Got my trusty wrench, but will it be enough?

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, 'cause I'm about to take you deep,
Into the depths of Pathos-2, where the sci-fi creeps,
A research facility under the sea, where they play God,
Experimentin' on humans, and makin' them nod,

Got my eyes on the ARS, Artificial Robotic System too,
Tryna survive in this abyss, but it's hard to get through,
Radio signals are weak, can't call for help or aid,
Just me, myself, and these creepy androids in shades,

Catherine Chun's voice in my ear, tellin' me what's at stake,
But her words is like venom, can't trust what she says or make,
Gotta keep movin', navigate through the dark,
Don't wanna end up like the others, just a gruesome mark,

(Chorus)
Soma, Soma, a game of survival and wits,
In this underwater tomb, you gotta fight for every bit,
No respawns or checkpoints, death is real here,
One wrong move, and your character's outta gear,

(Verse 2)
Scan the environment, gather info, don't be slow,
Those robots can sneak up quick, put a bullet in your dome,
Security's compromised, systems goin' haywire,
Can't let the machines win, gotta set the human fire,

Databanks and terminals holdin' secrets untold,
Got my pickin' locks skills sharp, breakin' codes old,
Sarah Lindwall's journal entries reveal the truth in pain,
They was experimentin' on us all along, no shame,

But something strange is brewin', somethin' unknown,
The creatures lurkin' shadows, growlin', moanin',
Can feel their cold breath on the back of my neck,
Time's runnin' out, need a way out this wreck,

(Bridge)
Conscience vs. Protocol, the choice is yours to make,
Free will's a luxury we don't have in this synthetic ache,
