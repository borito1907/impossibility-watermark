Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at night 
The stars twinkle above, a celestial map guiding us home 
 Memories of the day linger, a jumbled mix of joy and sorrow 
As we reflect on our experiences, searching for lessons to learn 

In the stillness, our minds wander to distant places 
Visions of what could be, hopes and dreams yet unfulfilled 
We grapple with uncertainty, seeking answers in the darkness 
A quest for meaning that may never be resolved 

Yet even in the unknown, there's comfort in the present 
A sense of grounding in the simple things: breath, heartbeat, footsteps 
For now, let us stand where we are, savoring this fleeting moment 
And trust that it will lead us forward into the light.

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
A heavy stillness that presses down on everything 
The trees stand tall and unmoving 
Their leaves barely rustling in the gentle breeze 

In this quiet hour, the world seems to hold its breath 
Waiting for something to stir, to awaken 
But for now, all is calm 
The only sound, the distant hum of a lone car driving by 

As the darkness slowly gives way to light 
The shadows retreat, revealing a new day 
One that brings with it possibility and promise 
And the chance to start anew.

Silence falls like a blanket over the city streets at dawn

The sky is painted with hues of pink and orange 
As morning light creeps over the horizon 

In this quiet hour, I find my thoughts untangle 
Like threads in a tapestry slowly unwinding 
The world stirs around me, but for now I'm alone 
Free to let my mind wander without distraction 

 Memories long buried rise to the surface 
Forgotten moments from years past come flooding back 
Each one etched on my heart like delicate brushstrokes 
Forming the intricate pattern that makes me who I am today 

In these early hours, all things feel possible 
A fresh page waiting to be filled with words 
And though the day ahead will bring its challenges 
For now, in this moment, everything feels peaceful.

The stars twinkle above, a reminder of the vastness 
Of the universe and my own small place within it 
A humbling thought, one that brings both comfort and unease 

I stand at the threshold, poised between what was 
And what will be, unsure which direction to turn 
The only certainty is the present moment 
A fleeting instant, gone before I can grasp it.

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at dawn 
A time for quiet contemplation, for reflection on the past and present 

Memories linger in the shadows, whispers of what could have been 
Fragments of dreams yet to be realized 

The world stirs, slowly awakening from its slumber 
As morning light creeps over the horizon 

In this fleeting moment, anything seems possible 
A sense of hope and renewal washes over me 

But life has a way of getting complicated, doesn't it?

Morning arrives with the faintest hint of possibility 
A delicate dance between darkness and light 


In those first tender moments before sunrise, everything feels within reach 
Dreams not yet entangled by reality's messy threads 


Nature awakens gradually, sounds unfolding layer by layered texture 
Birdsong swelling amidst rustling leaves


And we move forward with renewed resolve 
Though life is unpredictable and can quickly veer off course


Perhaps in embracing uncertainty 
We find freedom.
