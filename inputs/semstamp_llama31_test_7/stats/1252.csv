Here's a draft of a hypothetical Eminem diss track:

[Intro]
Yo, it's been a minute since I've been provoked,
But some rappers think they can get in my scope,
Got a new target on my radar screen,
Thinkin' they can take the throne from the real Slim Shady machine,

[Verse 1 - Targeting Travis Scott]
Travis Scott, where'd you go wrong?
",True,1,"1,4",True,1
22,"Thought you were a leader, now your style is gone,
Mumbling through bars like you're underwater cold,
 Astroworld failed, that's all you hold,
La Flame burned out, ain't no one impressed,
Your album sales ain't even close to what I repress,
Playin' with fire, but you ain't the spark,
Got more gadgets than a kid in a candy dark,

[Chorus]
I'm back on the attack, got my eyes on the prize,
New opponents emerge, but they'll meet demise,
No need for mercy, just a sharp tongue,
Leavin' foes in the dust, while I move along,

[Verse 2 - Taking Aim at Lil Uzi Vert]
Lil Uzi, boy, your flow is whack,
Got more rhymes about ""yeah"" than facts,
Cuddle buddy culture, is that your goal?
",True,1,"6,2",True,1
23,"Makin' hits with ""Sicko Mode"", but your skills went flat all along,
Tryna be the leader of the youth, but you're just a joke,
Your rhymes so watered down, like a lukewarm Coke,
You got style over substance, that's your claim to fame,
Autotune ain't hidin' your shame, still ain't changin' the game,

[Chorus]
I'm back, the king has returned, reign supreme,
Don't wanna mess with me, it's not what it seems,
Step aside kids, or get left behind,
My rhymes so sharp, might cut through the shine,

[Verse 2 - Going after Drake]
6 God, huh?",True,1,"6,2",True,2
24,"Your rhymes are stale like your relationship with Kylie strong,
Faking the funk, trying to fit in,
Astroworld?",True,1,"6,2",True,3
25,"Thought you was Astroworld king, but your flow's gone wrong,
Got more auto-tune than a karaoke bar,
Your style's as stale as last year's laundry, who cares about your Mars,
Selling out shows, but your music's a bore,
Don't pretend like you're underground no more,
Just a mainstream puppet with designer flair,
If hip-hop's dead, it's 'cause of rappers like you, I swear,

[Chorus]
I'm back with a vengeance, time to make amends,
All these pretenders know I'm still the trend,
My flow's so sick, got a vaccine for fakes,
Eminem's the real deal, all others just imitate,

[Verse 2 - Targeting Lil Pump]
Lil Pump, what's up little dude? 
",True,0,"6,2",True,4
26,"Sold your soul for the Grammys all day long,
Your rhymes are stale, like last week's leftover trash,
Astroworld?",False,,,,5
27,"Thought you were innovatin', but your flow's gone stale, son,
Your beats sound like a cheap video game theme,
Astroworld?",True,5,"6,2",True,6
28,"Thought you was gonna bring back the sound all along,
But your rhymes are shallow, and your flow's whack,
Like a one-trick pony with a bunch of trap attack,
""La Flame"", more like ""La Flaw"", kid,
Your music's a snooze-fest, never had a hot hit,
Tryna hop on other people's style,
Fake Travis, never authentic all the while.

",True,0,"6,2",True,7
29,"Your flows like a kid playing with Lego blocks all day long,
 Astroworld?",False,,,,8
30,"Autotune and flailing all day long,
You had a chance with ""Sicko Mode"", but that was last year,
Now your album sales plummeted like your career,
Got more tattoos than bars, what a sight to see,
Your flows stale, a redundant rhyme scheme calamity,
From ""Antidote"" to ""Stop Trying to Be God"",
Your whole discography is just a sad-sack nod.

",True,1,"6,2",True,9
31,"Thought you were a innovator, now you're just movin' along,
Your Astroworld festival, more like Astro-scam,
 Charging fans big bucks to see a half-empty plan,
Your flows so basic, like a nursery rhyme scheme,
You ain't never gonna touch the real, just a weak imitation dream,

[Chorus]
You can't touch me, you can't beat me,
I'm the king of controversy, always speak free,
Tryna come at me with your mediocre bars,
But I'll shred 'em up like old newspaper cars,

[Verse 2 - Dissin' Lil Yachty]
Lil Yachty, Lil Boat, what happened to the ship?
",False,,,,10
32,"Thinkin' you're the king, but your rhymes are all wrong,
 Astroworld?",False,,,,11
33,"Thought Astroworld was fire, but your flow's been gone,
Autotune's your crutch, ain't no skill to back it up,
Astonishing that you're still poppin', gotta give the haters some props,

Rodeo style?",True,1,"6,2",True,12
34,"From ""Antidote"" to ""Sicko Mode"", now your flow's gone cold,
Tryna ride the coattails of Kanye's Yeezy wave,
But without the genius, you're just a miniature cave,
Your voice is annoying, like nails on chalkboard pain,
La Flame?",True,1,"6,2",True,13
35,"You went from La Flame to La Fake, all day strong,
Mimickin' sounds, tryna steal the style,
Astroworld but your music's lost in space, it's worthwhile,
From ""Sicko Mode"" to Sickening Flow,
Your rhymes is stale, boy, like a bag of potato chips that's old,

[Chorus]
I'm the king of controversy, ain't nobody touchin' me,
Bow down or get destroyed, this industry's dynasty,
Fake rappers better get a check-up with their doc,
When I spit bars, I make a mess, never goin' pop,

[Verse 2 - Targeting Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat, when did you lose your way?
",True,1,"6,2",True,14
36,"From Houston to hell, your flow's gone,
 Used to rock mosh pits, now you're just a shell,
Touring with pop stars, your street cred fell,
Astroworld got delayed, like your entire career,
Fake tough guy, more glitter than gear,
Your music's like a sugar high, short-lived delight,
While I'm the real Slim Shady, day and night.

",True,1,"6,2",True,15
37,"From trap beats to festival songs that don't belong,
Your music's like a clown car, all sound effects,
When did autotune become the only skill set?

",True,0,"6,2",True,16
38,"Your music sounds like a baby's first song,
 Formulaic flow, never been strong,
Addicted to auto-tune, your voice ain't goin' long,
Selling out crowds with your Fortnite shows,
My lyrical prowess would leave your fans froze,
In awe of greatness, wonderin' what hit 'em,
While your rhymes sound like bubblegum rants.

",True,1,"6,2",True,17
39,"Thought you were Astroworld champ, but now you're just a clone,
Of every SoundCloud rapper who came before,
Your flow's all mumbled, like you got a mouthful of more,
Pills and potion, yeah, we know your recipe,
Autotune your vocals, still can't make 'em nice and neat,
When I'm on the mic, I rip through bars like a knife,
Leavin' your Cactus Jack crew in life,

[Chorus]
New kid on the block, thinks he's quick on his feet,
Ain't nobody touchin' me, ain't nobody on my beat,
Been in this game too long, seen the ups and downs,
While these rookie MCs wearin' their crowns,

[Verse 2 - Targeting Lil Pump]
Lil Pump, that Gucci gang lifestyle you flaunt,
Can't even remember the last time you wrote a hook without a taunt,
Fendi this and Fendi that, all you ever rap about,
Fake jewelry and designer tags, when will you shut that out?
",True,0,"6,2",True,18
40,"Thought you was a rockstar, now your rhymes sound like a song,
By the Jonas Brothers, autotune in full swing,
Can't even recognize your own voice, what a fake king.
",True,0,"6,2",True,19
41,"From selling out shows to sellin' your soul all day long,
 Astroworld disaster, that was just a taste,
Your music's whack, but your ego's still first place,
Can't even touch the flow of a D-Town vet like me,
 Auto-tune, yeah, that's the only thing you're good at, G,
Rap game's in shambles, with mumble-rappers on the rise,
But when it comes to bars, boy, you ain't no prize.

",True,1,"6,2",True,20
42,"Rappin' like a toddler with a weak little song,
From La Flame to Cactus Jack, your labels all whack,
Got no substance, just mumble rap in a shallow pack,
Your rhymes so boring, got nothin' to say,
Soundin' like a chipmunk with a broken play,
Lost his momentum, just strays away,
Like a one-hit wonder, where'd your career stray?

",True,1,"6,2",True,21
43,"From autotune king to soundin' like a song gone wrong,
""Rodeo"" was cute when you were on tour,
But now your live shows just look like an undercard bore,
Your bars so dry, might need IV hydration,
Can't touch my rhyme books, boy, that's no imagination,

[Chorus]
Who do you think you're gonna diss, huh?
",True,1,"6,2",True,22
44,"Thought Astroworld was a movement, now it's just gone,
Your rhymes so weak, it's like a never-endin' chore,
Autotune ain't savin' you no more,
You're just a clone, a cheap imitation,
Tryna ride the coattails of Kid Cudi's desperation,

[Chorus]
I'm the king of controversy, back with another claim,
Rippin' apart the game, no one can stop my aim,
From Texas to LA, I'm takin' names,
If you step up, you'll end up in flames,

[Verse 2 - Targeting Lil Uzi Vert]
Lil Uzi Vert, what happened to your swag?
",True,3,"6,2",True,23
45,"Thought your autotune was strong enough to carry all day long?
",True,0,"6,2",True,24
46,"Thought you was fire, but your rhymes all sound like songs,
Your live shows a joke, all that mosh pit nonsense too,
Fake rebel tryna sell out with Astroworld too,

You stole the flow from André, it's plain to see,
Ranting 'bout your riches, ain't none of us care about your Gs,
Cactus Jack should be callin' out security checks,
You might as well just wear a ""Made-in-2019"" label on your specs,

[Chorus]
All comers step aside, it's time to claim my right,
King of controversy, igniting through the night,
A ticking bomb is what these haters'll ignite,
Eminem strikes back, gonna make it clear, no time to unite,

[Verse 2 - Taking aim at Lil Pump]
Pump up the beef, now you're in my crosshair zone,
Thought you got the juice, more like orange peel tone,
Gucci Gang?",False,,,,25
47,"From ""Antidote"" to the abyss, your flow's gone,
Was once the king of mosh pits, now you're just a mess,
Cudi's disciple, can't even dress like a success,
Your rhymes are basic, like a Kindergarten test,
Tryna revive the 90s, but you ain't no West Coast best,
I'm the real Slim Shady, still makin' hits that stick,
You're just a La Flame imposter, with a career on sick,

[Chorus]
Diss game strong, I'm back in the fray,
Leavin' these new jacks in disarray,
Aim locked and loaded, verbal assassin style,
Don't even think 'bout steppin' up, you'll only smile,
When I roast you alive, so sit back and enjoy,
The ride of shame, with your credibility destroyed,

[Verse 2 - Targeting Lil Uzi Vert]
Lil Uzi Vert, another clone in line,
Thought he could rival Em, what a waste of time,
Mumbled rap, tryna fit in the mold,
Emo-rap experiment, went straight to the cold,
Melodic flows that don't make sense at all,
You're just an autotune puppet, standin' tall,
Got a bad case of repetitive chorus disease,
My tracks remain timeless, yours are deleted with ease,

[Bridge]
These two may have sold a few records too,
But their music's forgettable, like last week's news,
I set trends, while they follow mine path,
My legacy forever etched, as the greatest in wrath,
This isn't about hate; I'm puttin' em in check,
To show there's still room for quality, ain't no neglect,

[Verse 3 - Targeting Both]
You both can try and respond, go ahead, give it a shot,
We all know how that story goes - crickets got more plot,
Step aside, I'm doin' laps around the block,
History won't repeat itself; I left footprints on the clock,
My artistry reigns, while y'all just copy-paste,
Two-dimensional rappers, my venom leaves permanent stain,

[Outro]
Bow down or bow out; pick a poison pill,
Timeless classics vs. flash-in-the-pan thrill,
Slim Shady signing off, kingpin supreme,
Forever runnin' this, this rap regime.

Pants so tight they'll show off your insecurities' gaze.

You better come correct or don't bother at all,
You're playin' with fire when you step into my zone, after all,
My pen's mightier than your fragile ego's pride,
Bow down, 'cause Marshall Mathers won't be denied,

Lil Baby, you think you're the kingpin,
Hardly breaking records, more like barely scratchin' within,
The top ten, that's cute, kid, keep dreamin',
Your baby talkin', whisper-rap style got me dozin' and schemin',
I'm Mr. Worldwide; you're still sippin' on the porch,
The last time you dropped knowledge was probably in high school report,
My flow's the best; you can't touch it, I confess,
While you're chasing clout, I'll always wear the crown with finesse,

These up-and-comers don't even scratch the floor,
They're carbon copies with zero lore,
History books are gonna leave their names off the page,
Meanwhile, my legacy will forever remain untamed,
