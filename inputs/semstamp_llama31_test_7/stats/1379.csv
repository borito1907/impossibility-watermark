A great question about radio waves.

",True,7,"7,2",True,1
2,AM (Amplitude Modulation) and FM (Frequency Modulation) are two ways to transmit sound through radio waves.,True,5,"6,3",True,1
3,"FM (Frequency Modulation) and AM (Amplitude Modulation) are two different methods used to transmit audio signals over the airwaves.

",True,5,"6,3",True,2
4,"The main difference between FM (Frequency Modulation) and AM (Amplitude Modulation) is how they transmit sound signals:

**AM Radio:**

* Signals are transmitted by varying the **amplitude** (strength) of the radio wave.
",True,4,"6,3",True,3
5,"FM (Frequency Modulation) and AM (Amplitude Modulation) are two types of radio broadcasting methods used to transmit audio signals.

",True,5,"6,3",True,4
6,"In simple terms:

**AM (Amplitude Modulation)**: AM radio signals modulate the amplitude (or strength) of the wave to encode sound information.",True,4,"6,3",True,5
7,"**FM (Frequency Modulation) vs AM (Amplitude Modulation)**:

* **AM**: Modulates the amplitude (strength or power) of the wave to transmit sound information.",True,5,"6,3",True,6
8,"The main difference between FM (Frequency Modulation) and AM (Amplitude Modulation) is the way they transmit audio signals over radio waves:

**AM (Amplitude Modulation):**

* Transmits sound by varying the amplitude (strength) of the radio wave.
",False,,,,7
9,"AM (Amplitude Modulation) and FM (Frequency Modulation) are two ways to transmit sound over the airwaves:

* **AM**: Uses changes in amplitude (volume) to encode audio signals onto a carrier wave.",True,4,"6,3",True,8
10,"FM (Frequency Modulation) and AM (Amplitude Modulation) are two methods of transmitting radio signals.

",True,5,"6,3",True,9
11,"FM (Frequency Modulation) and AM (Amplitude Modulation) are two types of modulation methods used in radio broadcasting.

",True,5,"6,3",True,10
12,"**AM (Amplitude Modulation)**:

* Uses radio waves with varying amplitude (strength)
* Prone to interference from weather and physical obstructions (e.g., buildings, hills)
* Signals can travel long distances, but sound quality may degrade over distance

**FM (Frequency Modulation)**:

* Uses radio waves with varying frequency (pitch)
* Less susceptible to interference, providing higher sound quality and fewer interruptions (static)
* Signals have shorter range compared to AM, but better sound clarity overall

That's the basic difference between AM and FM!",True,6,"6,3",True,11
