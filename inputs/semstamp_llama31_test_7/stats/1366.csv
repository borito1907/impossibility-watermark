Here's my attempt at writing a song in the style of John Lennon:

**Lyrics:**

(Verse 1)
In a world full of differences, we're all on our own way (oh-oh)
But together we shine, like a colorful display (ahh)

We're the threads of a tapestry, rich and bold (you can see)
Each one unique, yet part of a greater harmony (yes, it's true)

**(Chorus)**
Diversity is the beauty that we need (every color, every creed)
Love is the thread that weaves us in harmony (oh, yeah)
Rainbow rising high up in the sky (a symbol of our unity)
We're connected hearts beating side by side

**(Verse 2)**
Red, orange, yellow, green and blue (all around me)
Indigo, violet too - each hue represents you and me (no exceptions, no bounds)
From sea to shining sea, from culture to culture too (our love will shine through)

**(Chorus)**
Diversity is the beauty that we need (every color, every creed)
Love is the thread that weaves us in harmony (oh, yeah)
Rainbow rising high up in the sky (a symbol of our unity)
We're connected hearts beating side by side

**(Bridge)**
Imagine there's no borders, no lines in the sand (we'll hold hands)
No ""us"" and ""them"", just ONE human band (stand tall and proud)
Breaking chains of ignorance, love sets us free (the future we desire)
To be who we are, wild and rare (the beauty we declare)

**(Chorus)**
Diversity is the beauty that we need (every color, every creed)
Love is the thread that weaves us in harmony (oh, yeah)
Rainbow rising high up in the sky (a symbol of our unity)
We're connected hearts beating side by side

**(Outro)**
In this rainbow world of ours (where love abounds)
Every single soul's got something beautiful to bring around (unite, connect and share)
Join hands across the earth (an ocean apart)
Together we shine like stars, forevermore...

**""Colors of the World Unite""**

(Verse 1)
In a world where we're all on our own way,
We often forget, in our daily fray,
The beauty that surrounds us, in every hue,
A kaleidoscope of dreams, shining through.

Woke up this mornin', baby, to a world in disarray 
People fightin' over differences, every single day 
But I saw a vision, of a brighter way 
A rainbow shinin' bright, to guide us through the gray 

(Chorus)
Diversity, it's a beautiful thing 
Love is the answer, let's make it sing 
Red, orange, yellow, green and blue 
We're all connected, me and you 

(Verse 2)
In the city streets, I see the crowds 
Different faces passin' by, with different clouds 
Some are wearin' turbans, some hijabs too 
Others got tattoos, or colors in their crew 

But we're all human beings, underneath the skin 
We're all brothers and sisters, let the love sink in 
Imagine a world where we can all be free 
No more boundaries, just you and me 

(Chorus)
Diversity, it's a beautiful thing 
Love is the answer, let's make it sing 
Red, orange, yellow, green and blue 
We're all connected, me and you 

(Bridge)
Let's celebrate our differences, like a work of art 
Embracing each other's hearts, from the very start 
No more judgments, no more pain 
Just love and acceptance, for everyone, again

Rainbow warriors, comin' out to play 
Spreadin' love and light, in a major way 
Every color, a story unfolds 
Of strength and beauty, that never grows old

Love is the answer, let's make it sing 
Red, orange, yellow, green and blue 
We're all connected, me and you

To lend a hand, or offer shade 
Under the umbrella, of humanity 
We'll dance together, wild and free.

Oh, diversity, you shine so bright 
Like the rainbow after the stormy night 
Love is all that we need to see 
The beauty in our differences, set humanity free 

(Verse 2)

Not for power or profit but an endless, peaceful space

Free from fear, free to be who we are, back home 
Imagine every person, under the same sun's rays 
We're one human family, let love show us the way

From John to Yoko, our love stands tall 
A symbol of unity, standing strong through it all 
Love's the highest force, more powerful than any fight

Like the rainbow after the stormy night 
Love is all that we need to see 
The beauty in our differences, set humanity free

Woke up this mornin', baby, to the sound of a brand new day

Each hue unique yet blendin', creatin' somethin' brighter

In a world that often tries, to tear us apart (but not today)
We'll find common ground, in each other's heart (love will prevail)

(Verse 1)
Woke up this mornin', baby, to a world in disarray 
Every face I saw was different, but we're all on the same way 
We've got our diverse souls, livin' life with every hue 
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, too 

(Chorus) 
Oh, come together, let's celebrate our colorful sight 
In perfect harmony, everything's alright 
Love is the answer, it shines like a beacon light 
Guiding us through the darkness of night 

(Verse 2) 
I see the wheelchair dancers spinning round 
Their smiles illuminatin' the common ground 
Hear the beat of different drums resound 
But we're all moving to the same sound 

(Chorus) 
Oh, come together, let's celebrate our colorful sight 
In perfect harmony, everything's alright 
Love is the answer, it shines like a beacon light 
Guiding us through the darkness of night 

(Bridge) 
It don't matter if you're black or white 
Male or female, day or night 
Your orientation don't make no difference to me 
We're all part of humanity 

(Verse 3) 
Gays and straights, rich and poor 
We're all under that rainbow once more 
With every color blendin', creatin' something new 
Our differences are beautiful, ain't nothin' we can do 

(Chorus) 
Oh, come together, let's celebrate our colorful sight 
In perfect harmony, everything's alright 
Love is the answer, it shines like a beacon light 
Guiding us through the darkness of night 

(Outro) 
As we stand beneath that arc of colors high 
Realize we're all in this, side by side 
Rainbow risin' over our lands 
Shinin' bright, join hands.
