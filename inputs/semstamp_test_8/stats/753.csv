203," For instance, for second-order kinetics:

dn/dt = -k \* n^2

These equations provide a mathematical framework for understanding and predicting the disintegration of materials under different conditions.assistant

Here are some examples of disintegration equations for different materials and processes:

**Radioactive Decay**

dn/dt = -λ \* N

where λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms.
