2500 μg/hour × 3 hours ≈ 7500 μg

Please keep in mind that this calculation is purely hypothetical, as consuming aluminum is not recommended.",True,5,"0,3",True,45

290," Calculate the hourly intake by dividing the weekly intake by the number of hours in a week: 
420,000 μg ÷ (24 hours × 7 days) ≈ 238 μg/hour

So, the tolerable hourly intake would be approximately 238 micrograms.",True,6,"0,3",True,48

292," Divide the weekly intake by the number of hours in a week: 420,000 μg ÷ 168 hours (in a week) ≈ 2500 μg/hour

So, for the sake of this hypothetical calculation, a human could theoretically ""consume"" around 2500 micrograms of aluminum per hour without exceeding the recommended weekly intake.",True,4,"0,3",True,50
