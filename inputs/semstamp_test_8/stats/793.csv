Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series,

∑[i=1 to n] 2^i = 2 - 2^(n+1)

So,

ln(Sₙ) = -ln(2) [2 - 2^(n+1)]

Now, taking the limit as n approaches infinity:

lim (n → ∞) ln(Sₙ) = -ln(2) [2 - lim (n → ∞) 2^(n+1)]

Since -2 ≠ 1, the series converges, and we get:

",True,1,"6,0",True,22
180,"which can be written as:

-2^1, -2^2, -2^3,...

Taking advantage of this, we can rewrite the infinite product as:

∏[i=1 to ∞] 2^(-2^i)

Using the property of exponentials that states a^(b+c) = a^b × a^c, we can rearrange the product as:

2^[(-2^1 + (-2^2) + (-2^3) +...)]

Now, recall that the sum of an infinite geometric series with first term a and common ratio r is:

a / (1 - r)

In this case, our series has a = -2 and r = -2, so:

-2^1 + (-2^2) + (-2^3) +... = -2 / (1 - (-2))
= -2 / 3

Plugging this back into our expression, we get:

2^[(-2 / 3)]

Simplifying, we finally arrive at:

a₁ × a₂ × a₃ ×... = 2^[(-2 / 3)] ≈ 0.7404807

This value is known as the ""Bretschneider's constant"" or ""Pötterlein's constant"".

",False,,,,28
186,"which is obtained by raising 2 to consecutive integer powers:

2^1, 2^2, 2^3,...

Using this insight, we can rewrite the product as:

∞ ∏ i=1 2^(-2^i) = 2^(-Σ[2^i from i=1 to ∞])

Now, the summation inside the exponent is an infinite geometric series with first term 2 and common ratio 2:

Σ[2^i from i=1 to ∞] = 2 + 4 + 16 +... = 2 / (1 - 2) = -2

So, the infinite product simplifies to:

∞ ∏ i=1 2^(-2^i) = 2^2 = 4

Therefore, the value of the infinite product is 4.assistant
