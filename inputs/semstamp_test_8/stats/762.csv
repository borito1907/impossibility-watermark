**Magnetic Flux Equation**

The magnetic flux equation is based on Faraday's law of induction:

∂φ/∂t = -R × i + V

where:
φ = magnetic flux (Weber)
R = reluctance (A/Wb)
i = current (Amperes)
V = voltage (Volts)

For an SR machine, the reluctance varies with rotor position θ:

R(θ) = R_max \* (1 - k \* cos(Nθ))

where:
R_max = maximum reluctance (A/Wb)
k = saliency coefficient (dimensionless)
N = number of phases (integer)

**Torque Equation**

The torque produced by the SR machine can be calculated using the co-energy method:

T_e = (∂W'/∂θ) × i

where:
T_e = electromagnetic torque (Nm)
W' = co-energy (Joules)
θ = rotor position (radians)

The co-energy W' can be expressed as:

W' = ∫V × i dt

Substituting the expressions for flux φ and reluctance R,2000 we get:

T_e = (N/2) × i^2 × (dR/dθ)

**Current Equation**

The current equation can be derived from Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL):

di/dt = (V - R × i)/L

where:
L = inductance (Henry)

For an SR machine, the inductance also varies with rotor position θ:

L(θ) = L_max \* (1 - k \* cos(Nθ))
