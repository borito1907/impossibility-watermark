When you roll a fair six-sided die, to calculate the expected value and variance of one roll, we can use the following:

* Expected Value: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 21/6 = 3.5 
* Variance: [(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2) / 6] - 3.5^2 = 35/6 - 12.25 = 2.9167 

For rolling the die n times, we have:

* Expected Sum: n * 3.5 
* Variance of Sum: n * 2.9167

So, when you roll 100 fair six-sided dice:

* Expected Sum: 100 * 3.5 = 350 
* Standard Deviation: sqrt(100 * 2.9167) ≈ 17.08

Using the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the sum will approximately follow a normal distribution.

Rounded to two decimal places, the answer is: [343.39, 356.61].assistant

I'm happy to help you with that question!assistant

The expected value of a single die roll is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 21/6 = 3.5.
