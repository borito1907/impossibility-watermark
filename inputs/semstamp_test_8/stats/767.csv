To evaluate this limit, we can use the fact that:

In our case, let's rewrite the expression as:

$$(3/(x-1))^{x-1} = e^{(x-1)\ln(3/(x-1))}$$

Now, we can take the limit as x approaches 1:

$$\lim_{x \to 1} e^{(x-1)\ln(3/(x-1))} = e^{\lim_{x \to 1}(x-1)\ln(3/(x-1))}$$

Using the property of limits, we can separate the limit into two parts:

The first part is easy:

$$\lim_{x \to 1}(x-1) = 0$$

$$\lim_{x \to 1}\ln(3/(x-1)) = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{1}{3/(x-1)} \cdot \frac{-1}{x-1} = -1$$

$$\lim_{x \to 1} ((x-1)\ln(x-1)) = \lim_{x \to 1} \left(\frac{\ln(x-1)}{\frac{1}{x-1}}\right)$$

This is a classic case of an indeterminate form (∞/∞), so we can apply L'Hôpital's rule:

Therefore:

To evaluate this limit, a clever trick is to recognize that it's similar in form to a well-known limit:

lim (x→∞) [e^(1/x)] = e

This limit is equivalent to:

lim (x→0) [e^x] =  to 1

Now, let's rewrite your original expression to match this form:

[(3/(x-1))^(x-1)] = [e^(ln(3/(x-1))/(x-1))]]

Here, we've used the property of exponentials: a^b = e^(b ln(a))

Now, take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln([(3/(x-1))^(x-1)]) = (x-1) \* ln(3/(x-1))

82,"**Approach 1: Using L'Hopital's Rule**

We can rewrite the expression as:

$$\exp\left((x-1)\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)\right)$$

Now, we'll apply L'Hopital's Rule:

$$\lim_{x \to 1} (x-1)\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right) = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)}{\frac{1}{x-1}}$$

Applying L'Hopital's Rule again:

$$= \lim_{x \to 1} -\frac{(x-1)/3}{1/(x-1)^2} = \lim_{x \to 1} -(x-1)^3/3 = 0$$

So, our final answer is:

$$\boxed{\lim_{x \to 1} \left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)^{x-1} = e^0 = 1}$$

**Approach 2: Using Taylor Series Expansion**

Another way to tackle this problem is by using the Taylor series expansion of the function $\frac{3}{x-1}$ around $x=1$:

$$\frac{3}{x-1} = 3 + 3(x-1) + O((x-1)^2)$$

Substituting this into the original expression, we get:

$$\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)^{x-1} \approx (3 + 3(x-1) + O((x-1)^2))^{x-1}$$

As $x \to 1$, the term $(x-1)$ goes to zero, and we're left with:

$$\boxed{\lim_{x \to 1} \left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)^{x-1} = 3^0 = 1}$$

Both approaches yield the same result: the limit evaluates to 1.

84,"**Method 1: Using the exponential function**

We can rewrite the expression using the property of exponents:

$$e^{(x-1)\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)}$$

Now, as $x \to 1$, we have:

$$(x-1) \to 0$$

So, the expression becomes:

$$\lim_{(x-1) \to 0} e^{(x-1)\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)} = e^{\lim_{(x-1) \to 0} (x-1)\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)}$$

Using the fact that $\ln(x) \to -\infty$ as $x \to 0^+$, we get:

$$= e^{-\infty} = \boxed{0}$$

**Method 2: Using L'Hopital's Rule**

Let's define:

$$f(x) = \frac{3}{x-1} \quad \text{and} \quad g(x) = x-1$$

Then, our original expression is:

$$\lim_{x \to 1} [f(x)]^{g(x)}$$

Taking logarithms on both sides (using the natural logarithm), we get:

$$\ln\left(\lim_{x \to 1} [f(x)]^{g(x)}\right) = \lim_{x \to 1} g(x) \cdot \ln(f(x))$$

Now, applying L'Hopital's Rule, we obtain:

$$= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\ln(f(x))}{\frac{1}{g(x)}} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)}{\frac{1}{x-1}}$$

Simplifying and evaluating the limit, we find:

$$= \lim_{x \to 1} (x-1) \cdot \ln\left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right) = 0 \cdot (-\infty) = \boxed{0}$$

Both methods yield the same result:

$$\lim_{x \to 1} \left(\frac{3}{x-1}\right)^{x-1} = \boxed{0}$$

Using the chain rule, we get:

The limit inside the logarithm is undefined, but we can use L'Hopital's rule:

Taking the exponential function on both sides (which is valid since the exponential function is continuous):

We can expand the expression around $x = 1$ using Taylor series expansions:
