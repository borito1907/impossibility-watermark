Captain marvel and the kree-skrull war explained:
Marvel Studios released the first trailer for Captain Marvel on September 18, 2018, and it gave us our first look at Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. However, the trailer didn't delve too deeply into the plot or the characters. But now, thanks to some new promo art and details from the film's stars and director, we have a better understanding of what's going on in the movie.

Captain marvel trailer breakdown:

The Captain Marvel trailer shows us a mix of action, humor, and emotional moments, giving us a glimpse into the life of Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), aka Captain Marvel. Here's a breakdown of what we see in the trailer:

    * The opening shot shows Carol crashing into a Blockbuster Video store in the '90s, which gives away the time period of the film.
    * We then cut to Carol in her suit, looking fierce and ready for battle.
    * Next, we see Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) without his iconic eye patch, which suggests this might be before he lost his eye.
    * The trailer cuts to a montage of action sequences, showing Carol fighting Kree warriors and destroying enemy ships.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
