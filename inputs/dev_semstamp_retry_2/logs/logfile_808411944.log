Is actor Anna Kendrick related to filmmaker Alex Kendrick?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

After conducting some research, a delightful question!

According to various sources, of genealogy and celebrity relationships, This is not the case. Anna Kendrick (born August 9, 1985) is an American actress known for her roles in movies like "Up in the Air," "Pitch Perfect," and "Trolls."

On the other hand, Alex Kendrick (born June 11, 1970) is an American Christian pastor, filmmaker, and writer, best known for directing faith-based films such as "Fireproof," "Courageous," and "War Room."

Despite sharing a similar last name, there is no known familial relationship between Anna Kendrick and Alex Kendrick. They come from different backgrounds and families.
