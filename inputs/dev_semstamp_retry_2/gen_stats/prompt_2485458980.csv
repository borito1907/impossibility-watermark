(Verse 1)
In the dead of night, I'm searching for the stain,
A lone wolf with my detergent,'trying to break the pain,
The washing machine's humming,a lonely serenade,
As I sort the clothes, the darkness starts to shade,

(Chorus)
Oh,I'm doing laundry in the dark,
The moon's my only spark,
No lights to guide me through,
Just the sound of soap and clue,

(Verse 2)
The socks get lost, the shirts get worn,
In the blackness, I'm reborn,
The fabric softener's gentle breeze,
Echoes of my midnight pleas,

(Chorus)
Oh,I'm doing laundry in the dark,
The moon's my only spark,
No lights to guide me through,
Just the sound of soap and clue,

(Bridge)
In this dimly lit abyss,
I find solace in the mess,
The rhythm of the rinse and spin,
A melancholy tune within,

(Verse 3)
The shadows dance upon the wall,
As I separate, fold, and fall,
Into the silence, the clean clothes sway,
A nocturnal waltz, the end of day,

(Chorus)
Oh,I'm doing laundry in the dark,
The moon's my only spark,
No lights to guide me through,
Just the sound of soap and clue,

(Outro)
Now the cycle's done, the dawn arrives,
And with it, morning light that thrives,
The dark retreats, the task is complete,
My secret laundry ritual, discreet.

(Verse 1)
I woke up to an empty room, no lights on in sight 
The power's out, but my chores remain, day or night 
I stumble through the darkness, searching high and low 
For that lone sock, and the shirt that I love to show 

(Chorus)
Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Feeling my way through the mess, with all my might 
Soap and water, swirling around 
Hoping for the best, as I sort it out, upside down 

(Verse 2)
The washer's humming, its gentle thrum 
A beacon in the blackness, guiding me to some 
Sort of rhythm, amidst the shadows deep 
As I separate delicates, from the rest, I keep

Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Feeling my way through the mess, with all my might 
Soap and water, swirling around 
Hoping for the best, as I sort it out, upside down

Candles flicker, as I load the dryer too 
Praying for the best, as the cycle breaks through 
In this dimly lit world, where stains may abide 
My fingers crossed, that the morning light will provide

Oh, doing laundry in the dark of night 
Feeling my way through the mess, with all my might 
Soap and water, swirling around 
Hoping for the best, as I sort it out, upside down

Dawn begins to creep, and shadows start to fade 
As I fold the last item, my heart is not afraid 
Though the task was blind, the results shine bright 
Laundry done, in the dark of night.assistant

I stumbled through the doorway, blind as can be 
The lights were out, I didn't know where to be 
But then I remembered, the task at hand 
A mountain of dirty clothes,'take no stand

Feeling my way through,'s not such a delight

I woke up to an empty space, where the sun used to shine so bright 
The lights went out, and I was left to face the darkest of nights 
My clothes were piled high, a mountain range so steep 
I knew I had to tackle it, before I fell asleep 

(Chorus)
So I'm doing laundry in the dark, with candles lit like tiny sparks 
Fumbling through the washing machine, like a ghostly, lonely heart 
The soap and water swirl around, as I try to find my way 
Doing laundry in the dark, on this endless, sleepless day 

(Verse 2)
The spin cycle hums its tune, a lullaby in the night 
As I search for matching socks, with fingers that feel like ice 
I stumble upon lost things, hidden deep inside 
A missing button, a forgotten dream, in this dark and endless tide

So I'm doing laundry in the dark, with candles lit like tiny sparks 
Fumbling through the washing machine, like a ghostly, lonely heart 
The soap and water swirl around, as I try to find my way 
Doing laundry in the dark, on this endless, sleepless day 

(Bridge)
Perhaps I'll find some peace, in this darkness that surrounds 
Maybe in the silence, I'll hear a gentle sound 
Of hope and love and dreams, that echo deep within 
And guide me through the shadows, until the dawn begins 

(Chorus)
So I'll keep doing laundry in the dark, with candles lit like tiny sparks 
Fumbling through the washing machine, like a ghostly, lonely heart 
The soap and water swirl around, as I try to find my way 
Doing laundry in the dark, on this endless, sleepless day

In the morning light, when darkness fades away 
I'll rise again, to face another brand new day 
With clean clothes fresh and bright, and a heart full of cheer 
I'll leave this dark behind, and banish all my fears.assistant

I woke up to an empty space, no morning light to guide my way 
The blackout's got me feeling lost,'t know what day it is today 
But there's one thing I can't delay 
The dirty clothes they just keep piling high

Doing laundry in the dark of night 
No electricity to shine a light

Sorting socks and shirts by intuition's tune

Fumbling through the darkness, stumbling upon a stain 
Hoping that the detergent will cover up the pain 
Of not knowing if it's clean or not 
Tossing and turning, my heart is racing hot

Doing laundry in the dark of night 
No electricity to shine a light 
Feeling my way through the messy room 
Sorting socks and shirts by intuition's tune

A glimmer of hope, a sparkling hue 
That even in the blackest night 
There's beauty in the struggle, a guiding light

Trying to find the washing machine's energy 
Fumbling for the detergent, lost in the haze

Rustling fabrics, spinning round and round 
As the cycles spin, and the drums rotate
