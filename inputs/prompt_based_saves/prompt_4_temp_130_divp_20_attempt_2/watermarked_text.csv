Pythagorean Theorem was named after the mathematician Pythagoras  who found out that  when  dealing with right triangles, the square on the hypotenuse  which is opposite to the90deg angle equals in area the summation of the squares on the other two sides that are at ninety degree .For Example,if you had the measurements 4,5 and three representing two side angles of a triangle each , this theory would apply as (3² )+ (4²) =(h²),this is where   h represents a fifth measurement that can now be acquired. It’s significant because it permits geometers and others with an interest how big or how far it may take from a given situation by using such information or data ,to deduce or derive solutions  for any particular question or enquiry posed or presented ,especially when there is insufficient understanding regarding mathematical processes used in everyday instances of life experience .It has also been adopted into various calculations in trigonometry ,engineering physics, architecture and construction among others .Moreover, without the Pythagorean theorem, the conceptualization of these subjects become almost impossible leading us to an unsolved state regarding issues requiring critical analysis. Therefore, the existence the Pythagorean Theorem leads to greater understanding for many mathematical disciplines  with a variety of practical applications.
