1,"The Pythagorean Theorem, one of the most fundamental concepts in geometry, establishes that in any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This simple but powerful equation, expressed as c^2 = a^2 + b^2, has had a profound impact on our understanding of geometry and mathematics more broadly, enabling solutions to complex problems including distance measurements, trigonometry, and calculus. The theorem is attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, although previous civilizations such as the Babylonians and Indians were also aware of its validity. Today, it remains a cornerstone of mathematical education globally, demonstrating the enduring significance and utility of well-established mathematical principles developed through centuries of study.",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
