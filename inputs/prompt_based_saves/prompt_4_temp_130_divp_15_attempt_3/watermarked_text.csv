1,"The Pythagorean Theorem is considered a crucial fundamental concept in mathematics. It describes and explains relationships between the side lengths with respect to the right angles of all triangles-isosceles, rectilinear, scalene, obtuse etc but particularly those contained therein: it offers means for finding missing sides or angles without directly having measured them. Moreover this simple tenet holds true irrespective of whether or where it's derived from. A square drawn on one hypotenuse shares this relation via Pythagoras theorem being the squares area summed equal would match that resulting if both legs were squared and joined - which also happens when looking at the three dimensional analogue known 'Pythagorean egg', making geometric sense through demonstration even visually despite complexity or unknown size ratios. Historically Pythagorian theorem predates mathematical discipline by millennia hence its profound impact extends well beyond mathematical discourse pervading fields such as engineering design and architectural blueprints; astronomy observational models(including Kepler's laws ) ; musical harmony & scales tuning based upon ratio intervals, while some philosophical undertones also resonate in the field , with Plato emphasizing  the eternal nature geometry thereby cementing this equation deep into humanity's intellectual roots spanning across cultures and societies .",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
