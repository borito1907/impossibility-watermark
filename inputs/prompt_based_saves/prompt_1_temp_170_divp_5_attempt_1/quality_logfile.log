Feedback: The initial response provided was partially addressing the instructions but contained notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, which would place it around a score of 2 on the rubric. There were multiple grammatical errors, including the misuse of "propose" instead of "proposed," incorrect formatting of bullet points, and inconsistent use of capitalization. Additionally, there were some repetitions and punctuation mistakes, especially in the first sentence, where phrases were repeated unnecessarily. The response was also lacking in detail in some areas, such as the explanation of oversight responsibilities and confirmation hearings.

However, the revised version of the response showed improvement in addressing the instructions with moderate issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, placing it closer to a score of 3 on the rubric. The response was better structured, and the grammar had been corrected, making it more coherent and easier to understand. Nevertheless, there were still a few grammatical errors, repetitions, and punctuation mistakes that detracted from its overall quality. Moreover, the explanation of the responsibilities could still benefit from further elaboration to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of a U.S. Senator. 

In conclusion, while the revised response showed improvement, it did not yet meet the high standards of a score 5 response, which would require complete absence of grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization or punctuation mistakes, along with an in-depth and accurate explanation of all the primary responsibilities of a U.S. Senator.
Score: 3
