[2024-05-31 13:31:57,890][watermarker][INFO] - Received completion: Write a paragraph about the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem in geometry. When creating this response, remember to be objective (not humorous) and provide detailed information.
Do not include the specific proof you studied. Focus on why it's significant in math/real life applications, including historical importance/context with mathematics or architecture as an example. The response does need some detail on where they are from though. Also talk about one negative, how pyithagoras theorem is now viewed. This needs only cover the last four/five lines briefly
