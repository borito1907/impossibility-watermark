1,"The ancient Greeks, led by mathematician Pythagoras 2,700 years ago, contributed greatly to our understanding of triangles with the development the fundamental equation for triangular and rectangle shapes-otherwise known as the Pythagorean theorem: (c=âˆša^2+b^2) . In simple words it explains that if you square both the sides [x ,y] of a square from the inside of one corner where it connects to another, then subtract their numbers together, and take the square root -you get a third side [hypotenus]. Significantly this very rule applies universally to any rectangle(where x2, and y2 can become any length). As a matter of course, these rules have served as bedrock for future math studies concerning planes (surfaces), solid forms & space concepts like calculating area etc... Furthermore when we apply this conceptualization at advanced level, e.g.. trigonometry/calculations dealing multi-dimension/vector spaces they all find roots here . Hence it bears testimony how this single relation spawned into multitudes branches throughout whole geometry sphere; further deepening mathematical science's profundity.",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
