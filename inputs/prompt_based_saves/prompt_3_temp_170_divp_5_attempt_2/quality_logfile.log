Feedback: This essay effectively addresses the topic of power in the Lord of the Rings series, providing relevant examples and demonstrating a strong understanding of the source material. The response is coherent, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a comprehensive analysis. The writer demonstrates excellent grammar and sentence structure, with minimal errors. There is some repetition in the use of certain phrases, such as "power" and "influential figures," but this does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The essay covers a wide range of characters and plot points, including Sauron, Boromir, Frodo, Aragorn, and Galadriel. Each character is used to illustrate a different aspect of power and its effects on the individual and society as a whole. This diversity of examples contributes to the essay's relevance and depth.

While the essay is largely accurate, there are a few instances where the writer could have provided more context or clarification. For example, the reference to Aragorn's "past actions" could have been expanded upon to provide greater insight into his motivations and growth throughout the series. Additionally, the phrase "the One Ring" is used without explicit explanation, assuming a level of familiarity with the source material that may not be present for all readers.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a high level of understanding and engagement with the topic, presenting a well-structured and insightful analysis of the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. Despite minor issues with repetition and clarity, the essay meets the criteria for a score of 4, as it effectively addresses the instructions with only minor issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.
