1,"Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem: The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental mathematical relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Given the lengths of two of its sides, it can be used to determine the third side and has various geometric applications due to this property. It underpins important theorems in areas as diverse as congruent shapes and three-dimensional space. Its wide applicability includes fields beyond traditional mathematics such as engineering, design, real estate measurements with applications in fields like GPS & flight navigation making it relevant from a historical standpoint as well as contemporary usages showing us not only what mathematics once encompassed but still continues today playing pivotal roles in several disciplines.",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
