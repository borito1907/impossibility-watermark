Describe the main responsibilities of a U.S. Senator.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

As a U.S. Senator,/raw.githubusercontent.com/Dongzhuo/phpexcel/master/excel/images/, your primary responsibilities include:

1. **Legislative Duties**: Introduce, of new laws, (bills) and vote on proposed legislation that comes before the Senate. Senators work with members of the House of Representatives to reconcile differences between bills passed in each chamber.

2. **Representation**: Represent the interests of their constituents, an entire state, rather than a specific district like members of the House of Representatives. Senators must stay connected with their constituents, the needs and concerns of people back home.

3. **Oversight**: Conduct hearings and investigations to ensure that the Executive Branch (the President and administration) is acting in accordance with the laws and Constitution. This includes reviewing presidential nominations for various positions, including Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, to ensure they're qualified for the job.
