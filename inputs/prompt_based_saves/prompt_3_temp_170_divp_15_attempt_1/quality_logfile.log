Feedback: The response adequately addresses the instruction to write a 250 word essay on the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. The essay exhibits a clear understanding of the theme of power within the context of the series, effectively illustrating its influence on both major and minor characters. The writer demonstrates a strong grasp of the narrative, identifying key figures such as Sauron, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, and Saruman, and succinctly summarizing their relationships to power.

However, there are a few minor issues that prevent this response from achieving a perfect score. While the grammar is largely correct, there are a couple of instances where sentence structure could be improved for clarity. Additionally, while the essay is coherent and relevant, there is some room for greater development of certain points. For example, the discussion of the artifacts could benefit from a deeper exploration of their symbolic significance.

Overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful essay that meets the criteria set out in the instruction. It demonstrates a solid comprehension of the topic and presents its arguments in a clear and engaging manner.
