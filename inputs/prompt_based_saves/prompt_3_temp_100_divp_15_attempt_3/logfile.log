Write a 250 word essay on the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. Only respond with the essay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

In J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, power is a pervasive and multifaceted theme that drives the plot and shapes the characters. The most obvious manifestation of power is the One Ring, of course, which grants its bearer unimaginable control over Middle-earth. However, of all the characters who come into contact with the Ring, only Sauron and Gollum are willing to succumb to its corrupting influence, to abandon their free will for the promise of dominance.

Tolkien suggests that true power does not come from external sources like magical artifacts, but rather from one's own character and convictions. This is exemplified in the figures of Aragorn, Gandalf, and Galadriel, each of whom possesses great authority without relying on the Ring or any other crutch.
