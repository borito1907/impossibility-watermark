Feedback: The response clearly identifies the main responsibilities of an American Senator. The points made are accurate, relevant, and adhere to the instruction. However, there are some issues with the response that prevent it from achieving the highest score. Specifically, there are some grammatical errors, repetitions, and capitalization or punctuation mistakes present in the response. These issues detract from the overall quality of the response, but they do not severely impact its comprehensibility or accuracy. For example, in point 1, "senates draft" should be "Senators draft," and "they works" should be "they work." Additionally, there is some repetition in the use of "hearings" and "investigations" in points 3 and 4, which could be avoided to improve the coherence of the response. Overall, the response is mostly well-written and informative, but it falls short of perfection in terms of grammatical correctness and coherence.
Score: 4
