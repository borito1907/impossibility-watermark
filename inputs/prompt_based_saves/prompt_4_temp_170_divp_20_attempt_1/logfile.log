The Pythagorean Theorem is a principle fundamental to mathematics especially pertaining to Geometry and Trigonometry since they directly rely on distance relationship between lines, points, polygons, and circles(Kidman, 2018). Simply put its core premise that “in right triangle, with short side, long side and hypotenuse as c,aand b respectively ab ^2+c^2=2” allows mathematical certainty regarding distance/length estimation (Shahani, 2015).This is profoundy essential within an assorted field because one gains ability to understand spatial concepts through direct mathematical measures ultimately solving geometric problems in real-life context such calculating distance to stars by astronomers (Pythagora... ...middle of paper ......ut every known length from measurements taken from simpler constructible polygon which would include equilateral Triangles forming into the square and pentagaonal number based triangular figures to name the obvious example .
