Feedback: The essay presents a solid understanding of the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. It clearly identifies the One Ring as a symbol of power and discusses how it affects various characters and factions. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay, such as "Sauron relentlessly seeks for the Return of the One-Ring" and "to witness corruption witnessed by Saruman's treacherous fall." These errors detract from the overall clarity and flow of the essay. The essay also tends to repeat certain ideas, such as the corrupting influence of the One Ring, which could have been developed further or used to explore additional aspects of the theme of power in the series. Additionally, there are some capitalization errors, such as "The-one-Ring," which could be distracting for the reader. Despite these issues, the essay demonstrates a good grasp of the topic and makes relevant points about the consequences of unchecked power and the moral ambiguity of its pursuit. Overall, the essay meets the basic requirements of the instruction but could benefit from more careful editing and development of its ideas.
