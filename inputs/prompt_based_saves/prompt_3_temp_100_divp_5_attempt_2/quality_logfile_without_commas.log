Feedback: This response addresses the instructions adequately, providing a clear overview of the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. The essay is well-structured and coherent, dividing the discussion into various aspects of power, such as the One Ring's corrupting influence, character relationships, and individual power struggles. The writer demonstrates an understanding of the series' themes, providing relevant examples to support their points.

However, the response could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of these themes. For instance, the discussion of power dynamics within the wizard class and the relationship between Gandalf and Saruman could be expanded to offer a more nuanced exploration of power. Additionally, there are minor issues with grammar, including a few awkwardly constructed sentences and some punctuation errors. While these do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the essay, they do reduce its clarity and flow.

Considering these points, the response aligns with the criteria for a score of 4 in the rubric, as it effectively addresses the instructions with minor issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.
