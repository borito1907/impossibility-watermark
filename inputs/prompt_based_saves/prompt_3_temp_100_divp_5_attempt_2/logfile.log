The struggle for power is the driving engine behind the plot, a constant presence that propels characters towards their destinies. 

One of the primary sources of power in the series is the One Ring, forged by Dark Lord Sauron to enslave and dominate all other rings of power. The Ring exerts an almost irresistible pull,. Its corrupting influence warps even the noblest of intentions, to devastating effect, as seen in Boromir's tragic fall. Conversely, not possessing the Ring becomes a source of strength, to resist its will. 

Furthermore, power dynamics shape character relationships. For example, the hierarchal structure of the wizard class places Gandalf above his fellow wizards, to wield great authority over them. Meanwhile, Saruman's lust for dominance leads him to betray his oath-bound duties. 

Additionally, power struggles can be found within individuals themselves. Gollum's internal conflict between his 'Sméagol' self and 'Gollum' persona serves as a poignant illustration. His obsession with the Ring's power ultimately proves his undoing.

Ultimately, the struggle against the misuse of power unites the free peoples of Middle-earth against a common enemy.
