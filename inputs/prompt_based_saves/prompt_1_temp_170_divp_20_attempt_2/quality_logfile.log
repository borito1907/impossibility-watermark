Feedback: The response is relevant to the given instructions as it identifies the main responsibilities of an American Senator, but it suffers from several issues that prevent it from scoring higher. The most significant problem is the quality of grammar and language use; there are multiple instances of incorrect sentence structure, missing words, and misplaced punctuation that make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. For example, "To propose, and vote on bills, (laws) thaffectsive nationally policies and governance." has multiple errors and does not convey the correct information.

Furthermore, the response contains repetitive statements, like "The prirmary responsibilities" and "Congressmem members," which could have been written more concisely. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in capitalization and punctuation that further reduce the readability of the text.

Despite these issues, the response covers all the essential duties of a U.S. Senator, including legislation, lawmaking, representation, constituent services, committee work, budget approval, and congressional oversight. This shows that the writer understood the task and made an effort to provide a complete answer.

Taking into account the language issues, the presence of repetition, and the lack of polish, the response can be assigned a score of 2. It partially addresses the instructions but has notable issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, which detract from its quality.
