[2024-05-31 14:23:33,363][watermarker][INFO] - Received completion: Write a paragraph about the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem in geometry. The Pythaogrean Theorme is considered one of most significant in all branches mathematics, particularly Geomoetry with special focus on plane right triangles and also three-dimensional cones and similar geometric shapes. Simply said, it determines if theirs can actually exist; therefore its application makes solving certain angles in mathematical computation more attendant for engineers or architects in practice building constrcutions. In addition, without proper graspings of ther premises or hypotesizing it being utilized through proof process within trig ,algenomic or advanced math applications we wldt encounter issues
