107," This highlights the existence of alternative forms of power based upon wisdom unity and consensus-building.

117," In this vein, Tolkien highlights the value of shared decision-making and consultation as a model of effective governance.",True,1,"6,2",True,13

119,An intriguing paradox emerges through Frodo's reluctant custody of the Ring wherein we observe both potentiation and diminishment simultaneously occurring.,True,7,"0,3",True,1
120,Another key facet of power lies in its effect on character: many instances demonstrate that unchecked might gradually perverts and erodes morality and rational thought – Boromir’s fall offers evidence for this claim as he too eventually falls under an uncontrollable grip exercised by his overwhelming desires.,False,,,,2
121,"Furthermore individual characters undergo transformative arcs, they confront their inherent capacity for wielding, such powerful resources responsibly or self-interestedly; ultimately opting frequently toward noble restraint such that love compassion generosity reign above the impulse towards personal gain.",True,7,"0,3",True,3
122,"Ultimately, however it is Frodo and Samwise Gamgee the relatable ordinary humans among hobbits, those who unwittingly shoulder much responsibility in destroying the Dark Lord's means but also understand that they can never assume such immense might as a privilege granted from the circumstances without becoming corrupted like many around them, Gollum Smeagol illustrates power's corrupting nature.

123,"Another dynamic exploration arises between friendship power based versus hierarchical power structures, the bonds shared between members - hobbit-like naivety of Sam towards Frodo ultimately prevail even amidst overwhelming adversity whereas strict chain-of-command-oriented structures - epitomised by Saruman's machinations towards the Uruk-hai armies are revealed incapable holding ultimate sway. 

",False,,,,5
124,Meanwhile certain characters like Aragorn represent virtuous empowerment that fosters development among others rather than relying upon authoritarian fiat: he assumes responsibility only begrudgingly yet selflessly and proves accountable amid the trials he must confronts ultimately yielding the throne to Faramir as reparation after claiming Isildur's former kingdom Gondor from its usurper.,True,4,"0,3",True,6
125,On the personal level characters grapple individually with internal struggles related to power dynamics.,True,7,"0,3",True,7
126,"Moreover, the novel provides subtle nuanced critiques of institutions: consider Rohan's aristocratic monarchy grappling with its obligations to subjects against maintaining internal unity or Mordor serving as the supreme example of bureaucratic tyranny under absolute leadership.",True,5,"0,3",True,8
127,"Additionally, to explore further the role and nature of 'Power' within Middle - Earth The story touches several human emotions that arise due power hunger notably Boromir whose tragic decline exposes dangers posed when desires get outbid personal conscience; his desperation leads towards destructions because self-centered needs overwhelm higher calling or loyalty.

",True,5,"0,3",True,9
128,"However, to assume all-power seeking activity should be seen simply as wrongfully excessive or evil could be deemed too naive an approach; rather within the scope of both benevolent and sinister contexts, the importance of how one navigates responsibility cannot be underestimated.",True,5,"0,3",True,10
129,"Throughout the trilogy the destructive nature of covetousness, both physical materialism such as Gollum and moral greed embodied in individuals seeking total authority over worlds like Boromir exemplifies the perils entailed when power clouds good judgment leading characters towards a downward spiral.",True,6,"0,3",True,11
130,Another critical aspect is seen through Gollum and Sméagol's tragic relationship.,True,6,"0,3",True,12

134,"Lastly, the relationships among members exemplify their contrasting notions of authority: for instance the fellowship as a unit operates without one individual having dominion whereas Boromir aspires to be his brother-like self-leader at odds.",False,,,,16
135,Notably the journey of Frodo illustrates the inherent dangers and temptations posed even by 'right' and virtuous motives when aligned with power grabbing agendas - Boromir ultimately succumbs because it is driven both fear & pride while others are vulnerable at different crossroads: Aragorn fears not taking the Ring despite having right bloodline claims to rule yet stays the course.,True,1,"0,3",True,17
136,"However it also cannot be ignored that many characters' paths were shaped, and affected by the power vacuums and conflicts emerging around key artifacts such as Bilbo's Sting and Aragorn’s rightful claim to the throne of Gondor.",True,5,"0,3",True,18
137,"The effects of excessive and abused power resonate throughout Tolkien's world-building too – in Mordor's arid landscape ravaged due to its dark lord's misaligned interests, destructive pursuits – demonstrating stark ecological and social implications accompanying a power-crazed pursuit.",True,5,"0,3",True,19
138,"Power dynamics also unfold among mortals where individual characters grapple internally between moral imperatives against baser drives shaped by ego ambition social pressure or trauma – illustrated most poignantly perhaps through Gollum’s tortured conscience perpetually torn between love loyalty toward Frodo and covetous yearning after its prized possession of the all-powerful artefact which ultimately became the conduit for his downfall.

",False,,,,20
139,The most iconic symbol of power within the narratives – The One Ring itself - also undergoes significant exploration.,True,5,"0,3",True,21
140,Power even takes a central focus within Frodo’s psychological turmoil concerning the weighty responsibility bestowed upon him by Bilbo handing over both the burden of bearing the Ring.,True,5,"0,3",True,22
141,"Tolkien thus contrasts these approaches to expose the consequences of concentrated power upon individuals and communities highlighting how it can ultimately lead down paths fraught with danger, tyranny, destruction, as symbolically exemplified via Gollum and Ring-induced psychological debilitation,.",True,5,"0,3",True,23
142,However this ambivalence towards wielding great power highlights a greater lesson - the corruptible nature embedded within individual entities attempting mastery.,False,,,,24
143,Meanwhile the tragic character arc of Gollum poignantly portrays the devastating impacts unchecked lusts can wreak – exemplifying the dark perils lurking beneath a corrupted psyche fueled only ever further downward by addiction to ultimate dominion epitomes an all-encompassing despair.,False,,,,25
144,"The character arc of Gollum represents another dimension of power, its hold can be both destructive and mesmerizing as he finds himself caught between its pull as a seductive force – and yet equally aware of peril.",False,,,,26
