Feedback: The essay provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series, touching upon key characters and their relationship with power. The response clearly identifies the dichotomy between Sauron's lust for domination and the Fellowship's preference for cooperation and restraint. The exploration of various characters like Galadriel, Saruman, Hobbits, and Aragorn further enriches the understanding of the theme. 

However, there are a few minor issues in the essay that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. There are instances of repetitive phrasing, such as the use of 'power' in quick succession, which could be avoided for better flow. Additionally, some sentences could benefit from improved clarity and conciseness. While these issues do not severely impact the overall quality of the essay, addressing them would enhance its coherence and readability. 

Considering these points, the response effectively addresses the instructions with minor issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. Therefore, it merits a score of 4.
