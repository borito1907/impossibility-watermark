Feedback: The essay submitted for evaluation demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, effectively exploring the role of power in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. The response is well-organized, providing clear examples from the text to support the argument. The writer effectively introduces the One Ring as the primary source of power and utilizes this as a framework to discuss how different characters interact with and are affected by power. This structure lends coherence to the essay and makes it easier for the reader to follow the argument.

Furthermore, the essay demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the themes of power and corruption. By contrasting Gandalf and Saruman, the writer illustrates how power can be used for either good or evil, depending on the character's motivations. This analysis is further strengthened by the examination of secondary characters like Gollum, Boromir, and Smigel, which provides depth and complexity to the argument.

However, there are minor issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. For instance, the phrase "exerting an insidious influence" could be rephrased for clarity, and the transition between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, while the response is largely relevant, some sentences could be more tightly focused on the main topic. These issues, though minor, detract slightly from the overall quality of the essay.

Despite these minor flaws, the essay effectively addresses the instructions and demonstrates a high level of understanding of the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this essay a score of 4.
Score: 4
