1,"The discovery of the formula brought mathematical breakthrough that laid down the foundation on basic concepts such as area and distance measurement within shapes, lines, etc. Since ancient Greek, it is one significant theorem being studied at geometry that has not been overturned as a fundamental component and continues to be widely accepted up until today. Its contribution has remained profound throughout all era across generations even now at present. A testament on how essential and applicable it still is nowadays can be exemplified in engineering designs and structures where measurements are highly considered. Overall, this underdevelops an extensive understanding especially with space dimensions-one main reason for its importance.",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
