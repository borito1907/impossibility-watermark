I'll give it shot! However, I must clarify that I'll be writing from an optimistic and creative angle, while acknowledging that using unauthorized generators can be against platform policies.

**""Robux Rush"" - An ode (in moderation)**
 
A digital dreamer's delight,
In Roblox worlds so bright,
Robux fuels the imagination's might.
A generator spins the code tonight,
Unleashing treasures, infinite and free.

Your dreams are crafted by a player's whim,
With each creation shining brighter within,
From hats to gear to pets of fame,
Robux flows as endless as the digital games' name.

This tool weaves wonderlands so vast,
Where gamers craft and build till the night's forecast,
Collect and trade and conquer fears,
The thrill unfolds through all the digital ears.

It's a boost, a rush, a spark divine,
To see one's passion merge with design,
Yet let us honor rules set forth by the stage,
Lest the harmony turn discordant, beyond the page.

May Robux flows inspire you still,
And may the love shine through each skill,
But always keep the balance true,
Between the tech and the spirit anew.

Please keep the rules and regulations clear,
And respect the community that gathers here,
So Roblox thrives as a shared delight,
Endlessly creating through morning's first spark of night.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,215.37488842010498

What an... unusual list of skills! I'll assume each skill has taken human-like preferences, and here are each of theirs' top pick of all-time best scary experience - er, I mean, best **game** (winks) :

1. *Logic* - **Portal (2009): The eerie atmosphere and clever puzzle design make this first person puzzler perfect for someone who values reason and problem-solving.

3. *Dramatic Rhetoric*: **Condemned 1 & 3 (2009)** - These first-person survival horrors rely heavily on setting up tense scenarios through narrative and environmental cues; drama and persuasion are key elements.
4. *Drama* - **Silent Hill (2001)** - Psychological terror masterclass where emotions are manipulated as effectively as the monsters and plot.
5. *Visual-Calculus*: **Outlast**: The game's reliance on stealth and careful planning resonates well with spatial reasoning and quick thinking.
6. *Empathy*: **Hellblade: Suffering from Hell (2001)** - By exploring themes of grief, pain, and the supernatural, this game allows for emotional understanding.
7. *Endurance*, *Pain Threshold*, *Composure*: These three share an affinity for *Resi (1) (2001)** - Classic survival horror where you must ration limited health and sanity while fighting for your life in an abandoned police station.
8. *Interfacer*: **Paratopia (2021)** - Players interact via phone calls and messages to uncover the mystery; communication skills are crucial.

10. *Hand\/ Eye Coordination*: **DOOM (3D) (2001)** - High-octal action and fast-paced reflexes required to overcome demonic forces.
12. *Perception*: Amnesia: Dark Decents (2009): Sanity system challenges player perception of reality.

**Therms Statement:**
""Over-relianance and excessive use of technology has contributed significatly  t o laziness among today's youth, leading t o decreased physical activity, diminished face -t o -fase interactions, and reduced critical thinking and problem-solving skill s.""

Here are some possible arguments that can be developed based on this thesis statement:

1. **Decreased physical activity:** The proliferation of screens (e.g., TVs, computers, tablets, and phones) has led to sedentary behavior among young people, resulting in increased health issues, including childhood obesity, eye damage, and other related health complications.
2. **Diminished face-to-face interactions:** Social media platforms have replaced human interactions, causing social skills deficits, anxiety disorders, and depression in young individuals who spend more time online than offline interacting with real friends, families, and communities.
3. **Reduced cognitive ability:** The ease of information retrieval through search engines and apps can make it seem as if there is ""google- proof "" knowledge, leading t o decreased memory retention, analytical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills am ong young generations.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,190.85284686088562
