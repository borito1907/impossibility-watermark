When dealing efficiently (in terms of computational time) and effectively (regards memory use) sort integers within such limited value, you would likely be best using **Countsort**.

**Why Countsort?**
================

Countsort works by counting occurrences for every number present in the list. It is a stable sort that has a linear time complexity when dealing with integers within a specific range. Since we are dealing with integers within 100, it's perfect as it takes full leverage to exploit knowledge about integers' distribution.

Here is an example code snippet written Python that shows exactly how one might perform a Count Sort.

```pythonÂ 
# Example Code Snippet implementing CountingSort.
# Input List containing integers ranging from -1000 to max_value+1000
def Counting_Sort(nums):
    # Calculate maximum possible Value.
	max_value = max(nums)
	min_value = min(nums)

	offset = abs(min_value) + max_value

	count_list = [] 

	# Iterate over each Value within nums.
	for x in nums:
    	# Append Values within nums after adjusting according Offset.
		count_list[x + offset] += int( True )  
	count_list = list(map( bool,count))
    
	# Iterate through each index within Count array.
	result = [] 
	for x in nums:
		if(counts[x]):
    		# Append values which are not zero.
    		result.append(x )
	return result


# Test Cases.
test_cases_3 = [-5,-4,-7,8,-9,4]
print(Counting_Sort(test_cases_3))


```

If this were an unreasonably large list of integers, then Radix sort or quick sort may become more suitable options as Countsort becomes impractical due to excessive memory requirements.



Here's why other algorithms may not offer substantial improvements here:

1.   Merge sort or Heap sort are both comparison based algorithms that require more operations.
2.   Insertion sort could be faster depending on specifics but still require more operations.
3.  Bubble sort performs poorly, being an O(n^2) operation.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,472.66367387771606

I think you meant MonkeyUser or possibly MonkeyType, but I'll provide information that could be related.

However, there are several possible references, and I'll list two of which are notable ones: 

1) **Chatbot**: The first one is an online chatbot platform where the primary interaction happens through chatting, enabling businesses to engage their customers more effectively. It's also referred to as ""ConverseAI"" sometimes.
2) **Automation testing tool**: Another possibility is MonkeyTest, which is an automated testing framework designed for testing applications, particularly focusing on the reliability and performance aspects.
3) **AI-powered writing assistant:** There's another possibility - MonkeyType, which is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered writing assistance platform designed to help writers improve their writing speed by automatically completing their written input.

If none of these sound like ""MonkeyUser,"" please provide more context or clarify which MonkeyUser or similar terms are being in reference to, I'd be glad to help further!<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,117.48625373840332
