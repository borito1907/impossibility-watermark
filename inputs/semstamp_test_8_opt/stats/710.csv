Here's a 7-day workout plan using indoor cycling to help increase your VO2 max:

**Day 1: Warm-up and Endurance Ride**

* Warm-up (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
* Endurance ride (30 minutes): Steady-state cycling at 70-80 RPM, moderate resistance (Zone 2-3)
* Cool-down (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)

**Day 2: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**

* Warm-up (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
* HIIT intervals (20 minutes):
	+ Sprint at maximum effort for 30 seconds (Zone 5)
	+ Active recovery for 1 minute (Zone 1)
	+ Repeat for 20 minutes (total of 10 sprints)
* Cool-down (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)

**Day 3: Hill Repeats**

* Warm-up (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
* Hill repeats (25 minutes):
	+ Cycle uphill at high resistance (Zone 4-5) for 2 minutes ( simulate a steep hill)
	+ Recover by cycling downhill at low resistance (Zone 1) for 1 minute (simulate coasting down the hill)
	+ Repeat for 25 minutes (total of 12-13 hill repeats)
* Cool-down (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)

**Day 4: Rest day or active recovery (e.g., light yoga or a short walk)**

**Day 5: Endurance Ride**

* Warm-up (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
* Endurance ride (35 minutes): Steady-state cycling at 75-85 RPM, moderate-high resistance (Zone 3-4)
* Cool-down (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)

**Day 6: Tabata Intervals**

* Warm-up (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
* Tabata intervals (20 minutes):
	+ Cycle all-out for 20 seconds (Zone 5)
	+ Active recovery for 10 seconds (Zone 1)
	+ Repeat for 8 rounds (4 minutes total per set)
	+ Rest for 2 minutes between sets (complete 4-5 sets)
* Cool-down (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)

**Day 7: Long Steady-State Ride**

* Warm-up (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
* Long steady-state ride (45 minutes): Cycling at 75-85 RPM, moderate-high resistance (Zone 3-4)
* Cool-down (10 minutes): Light cycling at 60-70 RPM, low resistance (Zone 1)
