4152583604,"The Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the convergence behavior of the average of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.

**Statement:**
Let X₁, I,X₂,... be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean μ and finite variance σ². Then, for any ε > 0,

P(|(X₁ +... + Xn)/n - μ| > ε) → 0 as n → ∞

In other words, the WLLN states that as the sample size (n) increases, the probability that the sample mean deviates from the population mean by more than ε decreases to zero.

**Interpretation:**

* The WLLN guarantees that the sample mean will converge to the population mean in probability.
* It provides an estimate of how close the sample mean is likely to be to the population mean for large samples.
* The WLLN is a ""weak"" law because it only ensures convergence in probability, whereas the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) requires almost sure convergence.

**Examples and Applications:**

1. **Coin Tossing:** The WLLN can be used to show that the proportion of heads in n coin tosses converges to 0.5 (the probability of getting heads) as n increases.",2.116950987028628,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ,17564.74930882454
