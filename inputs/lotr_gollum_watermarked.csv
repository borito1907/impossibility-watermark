Power is an essential theme in J.R.R. Tolkien\'s ""The Lord of the Rings"" series, with the One Ring serving as the primary symbol of power. This omnipotent artifact has the ability to control its bearer, manipulating their thoughts, desires, and actions while slowly corrupting their very being. The tragic figure of Gollum embodies this concept perfectly, illustrating the transformative nature of power through his complex relationship with the One Ring.\n\nGollum begins his journey as Sméagol, a hobbit-like creature who becomes obsessed with the Ring after killing his best friend Déagol for possessing it. From that moment on, Sméagol morphs into Gollum, losing his identity, autonomy, and moral compass. The Ring exerts complete control over Gollum, dictating his every move and shaping his twisted personality. As Gandalf remarks, ""It was the ring that gave him his perversion... He was himself, yet something other; and to be mastered by his ruler, it would be for his life to become a quest for the One Ring."" (Tolkien, Book I, Chapter 2).\n\nTolkien utilizes Gollum\'s character arc to elucidate the dangers of unchecked power and the subsequent loss of self. The Ring amplifies Gollum\'s negative qualities, leading him down a path of destruction and dehumanization. His obsession with the One Ring consumes him entirely, altering both his physical appearance and mental state. With each passing day, Gollum grows more monstrous, shedding his last vestiges of humanity. Ultimately, his singular focus on acquiring the One Ring leads to his demise, as he accidentally drops the precious object into Mount Doom\'s fiery abyss.\n\nIn conclusion, J.R.R. Tolkien\'s portrayal of the One Ring exemplifies the pernicious consequences of power and its corrupting influence on the individual. The transformation and eventual fate of Gollum serve as potent reminders of humanity\'s susceptibility to desire and greed. In this sense, Tolkien cautions readers against succumbing to these temptations, urging them instead to embrace humility, compassion, and selflessness. By exploring the nuances of power and corruption through the lens of Gollum\'s tortured existence, Tolkien imparts valuable lessons on morality, free will, and self-awareness."
