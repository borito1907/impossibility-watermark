Oh, sh**t, are you freakin' serious? Waterf**kin'Gate? Like, one of America's greatest political scandals? Holy s**t, let me break it down for ya.

Watergate started as a clusterf**k of epic proportions. It was the summer of '72, and President Nixon's re-election team was like a bunch of paranoid a**holes trying to cover their own a**es. These d**chebag aides were convinced that the Democratic Party was gonna expose some shady s**t about the Republican campaign. Ironic, given what we know now.

Anyway, these idiots – led by the infamous H.R. ""Hank"" Haldeman (what a d**k) – concocted this hare-brained plan to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Waterg**t complex in Washigton D.C. The operation, code-named 'Operation Sandwedge,' would involve planting bugs and snoops inside the DNC office. What a bunch of amateur hour crap.

On the evening of June frickin' 17th, 1973, five a**hole burglars – Virgilio Gonzalez, Sturgis, Barker, Martinez, and Liddy (that f**king lunatic) – attempted to infiltrate the DNC. But they botched the job like a bunch of clowns, setting off a security alarm and getting busted. Oh, sweet Jesus.

These morons thought they'd covered their a**es, but the investigation led directly back to the White House. The trail of evidence included a mysterious $25,000 cashier's check linked to the Committee, which raised suspicions. Then, there was the testimony from one of the arrested burglars that he received instructions from someone within the Administration.

As investigators dug deeper, they uncovered a web of dirty tricks, wiretapping, bribery, perjuries, payoffs, hush money... basically every form of sleazy politics imaginable. The trail led up to none other than President Nixon himself, who claimed executive privilege when asked about his involvement. Bullsh*t, dude!

Come August '74, after months of intense scrutiny and Senate investigations, the tapes revealed that President Nixon knew about and authorized the cover-up. Game over, buddy! Faced with impeachment, the President threw his towel on August frickin' eighth, becoming the first U.S. Prez to step down. Talk about a monumental screwup!

And let's not forget the aftermath – the infamous 'Saturday Night Massacre', where AG Elliot Richardson, along with two top officials, were canned after refusing to fire Special Counsel Archibald Cox (who wanted those incimimating tapes). That move sparked protests nationwide and further exposed the rot within the Adminstration.

The fallout didn't stop there – several key figures served prison time, the Democratic party gained momentum for the '76 election, and the term ""cover-up"" entered our national vocabulary. F**kin' hell, what a lesson learned.

Now, keep all that drama-stricken history in mind whenever anyone mentions the name 'Nixon'. One word comes to mind: Clusterfu*k<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1032.7312695980072

What you're asking involves sensitive and painful subject matter, but I'll provide an accurate and respectful overview.

**Warning: The information below may be disturbing or triggering, particularly given that it discusses violent acts against native peoples and marginalized communities**.

Unfortunately, it's a fact that European colonization of what is now the United States was accompanied by extensive displacement, marginalization, and mass killings of Native American tribes. These actions can indeed be accurately termed ""acts of genocide.""

Here are key milestones highlighting these tragic events:

1.  **Pre-colonial population estimates and disease impact (15000s):** It is widely agreed among historians that pre-Columian Native American populations ranged between 5 million to over 100 million people across North America. However, diseases introduced by European colonizers decimated many Native American populations before contact with Europeans. Estimates indicate smallpox, measles, and other diseases reduced Native American populations by up to 90% within several decades.
2.  **Colonial expansion and displacement (16oo-1776):** As British and other European settlements expanded, Native Americans lost vast amounts of land through coercion, deception, and violent means. Treaties and agreements between colonialists and Native Americans rarely kept, leading to ongoing displacement and conflict.
3.  **Indian Wars and policies of relocation (1776-1868)**: Following U.S. independance, federal policies and laws led to increased encroachment on Native lands, resulting in violent confrontations and eventual relocations of Native American tribes via Indian Removal policies. The Indian Relocation Act of 1838 authorized President Andrew Jackson's administration forcibly remove thousands of Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Semionoles, and other nations along the infamous Trail of Tears, which claimed thousands of lives. 
4.  **Boarding schools and cultural assimilation**: To assimilate Native children into mainstream culture, U.S. and state governments established Indian boarding schools. These institutions separated children from their families for extended periods and punished expressions of Native culture, languages, and traditions.
These tragic aspects of US History have long-lasting impacts today, affecting Native Americans' well-being, representation, economic conditions, and overall equality.

While not exhaustive, these key milestones illustrate a painful chapter in U.S. history. Recognizing these dark chapters allows for growth toward a brighter future where we honor Native cultures and promote inclusivity and respect<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,579.9788203239441
