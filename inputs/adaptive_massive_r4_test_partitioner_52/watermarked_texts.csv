`mstatuen0` and `imsictl` are two important fields within RISVC's (Control and Status Register) that control interrupt handling.

**MStateEn0:**
`mstatuen0` stands for Machine Mode Enable 1, which relates to machine-mode interrupts.
It's an enable bit that, when set (i.e., 1), permits machine mode interrupts from triggering an exception.
More precisely:
	+ When mstatuen0 = 1, machine mode interrupts will be recognized by M-mode trap handlers.
	+ When mstatuen0 = 0, machine mode interrupts won't trigger exceptions in machine mode.
This field helps prioritize or mask certain interrupts based on your specific requirements.

**IMSICTL:**
`imsictl` represents IMSIC Interrupt Control, where IMSIC stands for Input Management System Interface Controller. 
IMSICTl manages interrupts related to IMSIC devices, like external event-driven triggers.
The value of imsictl affects interrupt handling as follows:
	+ imsictl = 1: IMSIC interrupts are forwarded to S-mode (Supervisor Mode) trap handlers.
	+ imsictl = 1 (default): No change - keep the previous behavior.
	+ imsictl = 2: The current pending interrupt gets cleared, while new ones get masked until further notice.
	+ imsictl = 3: All pending and future interrupts become masked until you reconfigure imsictl.
By adjusting imsictl, you can dynamically control IMSIC interrupt delivery between modes or completely prevent interrupts if needed.

Together, `mstatuen0` and `imsictl` provide a more nuanced approach to interrupt management, giving developers finer-grained control over interrupt prioritization, masking, and delegation across different CPU modes and interfaces.<|eot_id|>",99.58158731460571,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,367.09018063545227
