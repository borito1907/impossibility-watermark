Unfortunately, it's challenging pinpoint that one single individual as there are varying accounts of ancient civilizations and monarchial lineages.

However, I can give you an overview of several notable figures from different cultures and time periods, each of whom could be consider among the earliest kings in recorded history:

1. **Sargon the Great (c.2305-2260 BCE):**
The founder of the First Dynasty of Ur, also known as the ""Akkadian Empire,"" which unified the region we now know as Southern Iraq.

2. **Menes (c.3100-3000 BCE):**
Often cited as the unifying pharaoh who united Upper and Lower Egypt, marking the transition to the Early Dynastic Period.

3. **Gilgamesh (c.2605-2579 BCE):**
While his legendary tale is well-known through the ""The Epic of Gilgamesh,"" some believe he may have been based on an existing person, possibly the fifth (not the second) king of the First Dynasty of Uruk.

4. **Hammurabi (1810–1749 BCE):**
Not the absolute ""first"" per se, but Hammurabi was the sixth Babylonian king who established the Code of Laws, which significantly advanced the rule of law.

Remember, the accuracy and availability of information for this period can make it tricky to definitively identify the ""First"" true ""king."" Nonetheless, each mentioned above holds significance within the context of human civilization.

DiversiteCH Consulting appears not be an existing or prominent consulting firm that I am aware of, but based upon general knowledge, here are possible insights.

If you meant DiversityTech Consulting, it could likely be related as an organizational consulting firm specializing primarily within diversity and technology. These types of firms typically provide services to help businesses improve workplace diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and implement strategies to leverage emerging technologies effectively in creating an inclusive culture. Their primary goal is generally promoting equality and ensuring all individuals feel valued at work by implementing policies to address systemic issues. Some common areas they might assist clients with include cultural transformation, policy creation, employee resource groups, and strategic planning around diversity and equity. Additionally, these organizations may provide workshops, coaching, and other tools for staff and management alike. Would that be something helpful? Or perhaps there's another aspect of Diverse Tech consulting that I can assist with? 

Please let me know if you are looking for any specific information regarding this or anything else. I'll be glad to help!  

Is there anything else I can help you with? Do you need assistance or clarification regarding anything else? Please feel free to inquire. I will be happy to help. Have a great day!  

(Note: My response may be limited due to potential non-existence of 'Diversatech Consulting' and lack of context.) 

However, should 'Diversitach Consulting' be an existing entity, kindly provide additional context or clarify what specifically would be needed from this query. I will be more than willing to assist accordingly once I understand better. Thank you!

I'll provide an overview of one of humanity's darkest moments.

Between 6 and 100, 750, people were brutally murdered over approximately 100-day period, from mid-Apr,  until mid-Jul,  994, as part of an ethnic conflict that occurred between Hutu (85% population) majority against Tutsi minority (14%) along some moderate. The Rwandan Genociderepresented an horrific climax for decades old ethnic strife. The killing started after President JUVÉnal Habyarimana died when his plane crashed, which led to extremist elements of Rwanda's ruling party launching systematic campaign to wipe out Tutsi minority. Neutrality or opposition to this agenda also made you target. The international community did not intervene effectively to stop killings, leading to devastating results. Eventually, rebel forces of Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF), mainly comprising Tutsi exiles, ended massacre by capturing capital and forcing genocidal forces to flee. Today, Rwanda has made tremendous progress toward reconciliation, but scars still remain.

According UK's Financial Conduct Authority (Financial Conduct Authority) Mortgage and Housing Market: Conduct of Business Sourcebook (Mortgages: Conduct of Business sourcebook, or MCD) 4/11/3a, it reads as such: 

Where an adviser is required to make and provide information to be made available under this chapter, he may make that information available to his client either:

(a) orally, where that information is not required to be in a durable medium;

or
(b) in writing, but with express written confirmation from the consumer that he has received that information. Where information is required to be provided in a durable medium only if requested by the customer must be in compliance with 4.3.1R(1). If information required in accordance with paragraphs (1)(b), (c), (2) and (5) has been previously given to the customer, there will be no need for further information to be given. In cases where information has not been provided to the customer, then it needs to be made available to him. It is recommended, however, that advisers keep accurate records of when and what they tell the consumers. Records are important because it helps to ensure accountability and transparency throughout the process.

Yanmar's arch-nems... err, I mean, Kubota's origins are fascinating! The Kubota Corporation was founded by Gonširo Kubota, an inventor and industrial pioneer from Japan, over 130 years ago. In April of1897, Gonširo established ""Kubota Shokai"" (Kubota Trading Company) as a manufacturer of steel plows in Oe, Japan, which is currently part of modern-day Kobe.

Initially, Kubota's primary objective was to develop innovative agricultural equipment that could help Japanese farmers improve their efficiency, given the limited land available for cultivating crops. During this time, most Japanese farms relied on simple tools, making labor-intensive agricultural techniques common practice.

In response to this, Gonširo Kubota introduced Japan's first steel plow, revolutionizing agriculture across the country. This pioneering invention led to increased crop yields, reduced labor costs, and paved the way for Kubota's continued success.

Fast-forward through several decades: Kubota expanded operations, incorporating new technology, diversifying, and innovating within other fields, including construction equipment manufacturing, engines, vending machines, pipe systems, environmental engineering services, food machinery, air conditioning equipment, as well as a wide array of other goods.

Nowadays, Kubota is one of the largest manufacturers of tractors and agricultural equipment globally. Their diverse portfolio includes everything from compact diesel engines to precision irrigation systems, all aimed at improving people's lives while minimizing environmental impact.

That's a brief history of Kubota's remarkable journey, spanning over a century!

Was there something specific you'd like me to elaborate on or perhaps another question regarding Kubota?<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,312.8912663459778

Ahmed Yesevi, commonly spelled as Ahmad al-Yesevi or Ahmet Yesevi, was an 11/  1  6  -cen tur  k  mystical  Sufi  saint and  one of  the most important figures in Turkic literature.

**Life**
Born circa (c.)1068 AD, near Sayräm (modern-day Turar Rısqulova, South Kazakhistan), he spent his childhood there and later moved to Samarkand (Uzbekistan) for further Islamic and mystical training. At some point, he returned to his hometown, which eventually turned into the center of his teachings and influence. The exact year of his death is debated, but it is believed to be between 1141-1173 AD.

**Legacy**

Yesevi's teachings were highly revered and had profound effects on Central Asia and Turkish culture:
* Founder of the Yasawiyya Order, which emphasized spirituality, morality, and social welfare, spreading across vast territories from modern-day Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, all the way through present-day Xinjiang (China).
* Author of ""Divan-i Hikmet"" (""The Collection of Wisdom""), which contains poems and wisdom that have been widely influential across Turkic-speaking lands, including contemporary Turkish literature.
* Known for the construction of the mausoleum dedicated to him, the Khawajah Ahmad Yasawi Shrine, which has been recognized by UNESCO World Heritage Sites and stands as a symbol of cultural importance today.

Overall, Yassevi played a pivotal role in bridging the knowledge gap between Eastern mysticism and Western influences, contributing greatly to the cultural and linguistic unification of the region at the time.

I'd be glad if I can assist!.)<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,373.8954074382782

2) The Triple Intervention of Japan, Russia and Germany in which France also had some involvement.

The Triple Intervention occurred after Japan's victory over china in the first Sino Japanese war of (1895). Japan won control of Taiwan and other territories including Port Arthur on China's mainland and also established influence in China.

Germany Russia and France forced Japan through this triple intervention to give up Port Arthur and return it to China in return for additional indemnity payment.

1 Sigma (1 standard deviation) typically indicates that 34,135 of all values are within one standard deviation from mean value.

When looking at control charts or behavior charts, 1 Sigma can be interpreted as an acceptable variation of values within which you'd expect to see most data fall.

In other words:

- About 66% of values fall within 3 standard deviations.
- Around 16% are expected between 3 and 3 sigma
