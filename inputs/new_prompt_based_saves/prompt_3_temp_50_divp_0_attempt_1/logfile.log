In J.R.R. Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings series, power is a pervasive and complex theme that drives the narrative forward. The struggle for power is a central motif, to which many characters succumb, ultimately leading to their downfall. 

The One Ring, created by the Dark Lord Sauron, embodies the corrupting influence of absolute power. Those who come into contact with it, including Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, are tempted by its promise of limitless authority. However, the Ring's true intention is to enslave and dominate all of Middle-earth, demonstrating the dangers of unchecked power. Even the wise and powerful Gandalf is not immune to the Ring's allure, highlighting the seductive nature of power.

Tolkien also explores the consequences of power without accountability through the character of Gollum.
