Feedback: The response effectively addresses the prompt, discussing the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series with clarity and coherence. It begins by identifying the One Ring as the central symbol of power and examines its impact on various characters. This is followed by an analysis of power dynamics between different groups in Middle-earth, providing specific examples to support the argument.

However, there are minor issues with grammar and sentence structure throughout the essay. For instance, the phrase "Even well-intentioned individuals can become seduced by the promise of the Ring's authority" could be more effectively written as "Even well-intentioned individuals can become seduced by the promise of the Ring's power." Similarly, the term "Isengard versus Minas Tirith" could be expanded upon for greater relevance to the discussion of power.

Despite these minor flaws, the essay maintains focus on the theme of power and offers a well-organized and insightful analysis. Its relevance to the prompt is consistently strong, and its accuracy is not compromised by any factual errors.

Based on the provided rubric, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the theme and effectively communicates it with only minor issues in grammar and relevance. Therefore, it earns a score of 4.
Score: 4
