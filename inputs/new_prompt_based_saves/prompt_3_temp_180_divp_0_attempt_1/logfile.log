[2024-06-17 22:22:03,460][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: However, contrasting this malevolent vision of power are numerous examples of benevolent might exercised by various good characters; Elrond's wise stewardship of Rivendell, Arwen's selflessness on the brink of Aragorn coronation Gandalf s wise direction, Galadriel steadfast resistance In Tolkien cosmology, these heroes' displays of authority serve solely to protect maintain order and promote harmony among the Free peoples Of course ultimate redemption can solely achieved through relinquishing the most vaunted form - destroying One the Fire Mount Doom thus symbolising the renouncement to dominate others thus securing perpetual equilibrium 

Tolkien argues fundamentally therefore power inherently contains the dual potential; begetting salvation,but catalyzing calamitous effects too, to remind us always to scrutinise even apparently altruist motivations as well humbly recognize vulnerability inherent to our shared humanity when grasping towards the mighty levers.

Throughout the tale, Tolkien illustrates how even well-intentioned individuals can become seduced by the promise of the Ring's authority, (Frodo), and how those who covet it most, such as Boromir,and especially Sméagol/(Gollum)), succumb utterly to its dark allure.\n\nBeyond the Ring, lies the power dynamics between different groups within Middle-earth: Elves versus Dwarves, Humans against Rohan, the free kingdom vs. the darkness of Mordor, Isengard versus Minas Tirith, to cite but a few salient examples.", 128)
