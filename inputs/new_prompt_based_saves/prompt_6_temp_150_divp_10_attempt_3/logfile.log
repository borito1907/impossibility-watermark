Debate whether students should have a role in curriculum design, citing potential benefits and drawbacks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's debate the topic of whether students should have a role in curriculum design, (yes) or not (no).

**YES: Students should have a role in curriculum design**

**Potential Benefits:**

1. **Increased relevance**: Students are more likely to be engaged in their learning when they have a stake in designing the curriculum. They can identify topics that are relevant to their interests and needs.
