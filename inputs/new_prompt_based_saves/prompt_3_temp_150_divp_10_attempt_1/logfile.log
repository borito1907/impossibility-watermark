However contrast this portrayal with the character Galadriel, the embodiment of wisdom, a powerful being with unparalleled control over her own desires she chooses to eschew absolute domination opting instead for a guardianship of sorts ensuring the survival not only hers but that if others alike her self discipline serves as a beacon an shining example that there exists another path in which power is exercised not at any cost or indulgent means but through responsible actions.
