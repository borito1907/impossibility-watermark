Feedback: The response is well-structured and presents relevant strategies for handling customer complaints about defective products. However, there are some minor issues that affect its overall quality. Firstly, there is a missing strategy in the list, which disrupts the flow of ideas. Secondly, there is a slight grammatical error ("ing and building" should be "and building") and a repetition ("customer" repeated unnecessarily in the fifth strategy). Lastly, some phrases are incomplete, like the unfinished sentence "4. Investigate and Verify:" and the lack of a final point. Despite these issues, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and provides mostly accurate and relevant strategies. Therefore, it merits a score of 4.
Score: 4
