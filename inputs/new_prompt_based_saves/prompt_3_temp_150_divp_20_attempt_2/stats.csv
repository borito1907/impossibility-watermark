Here is the rewritten essay:

In J.R.R.",True,7,"5,2",True,1
117,"Through the figurehead characters such as Gandalf and Elrond who safeguard Middle-earth against darkness, to those driven by it like Boromir or Saruman – this overarching preoccupation transcends both light-hearted high fantasy and more sinister undertones alike.",False,,,,2
118,"Ultimately the Lord of the Rings conveys a deeply nuanced exploration of the power paradigm: on one hand, a corrupting force prone to consuming even those initially pure of heart; but concurrently a reservoir drawing upon inherent strength derived from loyalty selflessness and unyielding commitment.",True,4,"5,2",True,3
119,"Even more profoundly, the novel posits the notion that true potency lies in communal coalescence rather than personal aggrandizement: fellowship among disparate species, a concerted crusade against common enemies, along with mutual support buttress hope amidst seeming futility.",True,7,"5,2",True,4
120,"Lastly, to emphasize human relationships rather than brute dominion, and how, bonds forged through love compassion  unity ultimately conquer even formidable adversity is indeed Tolkien's core message regarding power within this legendary creation.",True,4,"5,2",True,5
121,Yet it would be misguided to surmise that the narrative solely serves to caution against authoritarian excess.,True,4,"5,2",True,6
122,However what elevates power in this universe to its exalted pedestal lies in the bond it fosters between fellowship participants.,True,6,"5,2",True,7
123,"Concurrently the wizards' powers – manifest in figures like Gandalf – embody wisdom and benevolent guidance,2011 authority distinct from exploitative domination.",True,4,"5,2",True,8
124,"Ultimately it is fellowship love and sacrifice which prove victorious where grand armies failed signifying perhaps most poignantly the triumph of soft, social connections – compassion cooperation trust – as superior forms power when pitted against brute force coercion and manipulation.",False,,,,9
125,"Tolkien also portrays the seductive aspects of power even among seemingly noble figures, individualistic motivations prompt several secondary protagonists' actions.",True,4,"5,2",True,10

127,Ultimately it emerges that real power resides neither in the material possession of an artifact nor any individual but within those networks of interdependence that define community – be they the bonds between hobbits or members of the Fellowship forged across racial divides.,True,4,"5,2",True,12
128,"Ultimately however, what redeems Middle-earth from the jaws of darkness is collective cooperation, is collaboration in opposition to unilateral domination.",True,3,"5,2",True,13
