Feedback: The response provided exhibits a strong understanding of the instruction, presenting a well-articulated essay on the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series. The response maintains coherence throughout, with a clear structure that introduces key concepts and supports them with relevant examples from the text. The use of Sauron, Gandalf, and Aragorn as examples provides depth and variety to the analysis, allowing the reader to understand the complex nature of power in Middle-earth.

Grammatically, the response is nearly flawless, with only minor punctuation errors that do not detract from the overall clarity or meaning of the text. The writer effectively utilizes a formal tone and appropriate vocabulary, enhancing the sophistication of the essay. The response also avoids unnecessary repetition and maintains relevance to the topic throughout, demonstrating a high level of accuracy.

The only improvement that could be suggested is the inclusion of more explicit connections between the characters and the theme of power, as some of the points made could benefit from further development and elaboration. However, this is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the response.

Considering the absence of major errors and the strong alignment with the given instruction, the response deserves a high score.
Score: 4
