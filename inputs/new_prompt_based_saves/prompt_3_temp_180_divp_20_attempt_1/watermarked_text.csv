1,"In J.R.R. Tolkien's esteemed Lord of the Rings series, power is a pervasive and multifaceted force that drives the actions of characters and shapes the fate of Middle-earth. The coveted One Ring,{\em}, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron, embodies the corrupting influence of absolute power. Seduced by its promises of supremacy, on his fingers held control over all Free peoples, those who dare wield it – Bilbo, Gentlehobbit and Frodo Baggins included- slowly morph into avatars of self-preservation.

Indeed, Gandalf the Grey warns of its debilitating influence, '“But what is said of the ring must come to an end; the quest of Erebor was fraught with danger but this surpasses: no dragon wake and ring, which lies in wait'”(Fellowship).  This notion speaks volume - an insidious authority capable of consuming even noble-hearted individuals exemplifies why free will falters against overwhelming domination. Consequently characters' descent(s) into darkness reflect internal struggles  fought between benevolent intentions and Machiavellian methods demanded for  ascendancy   ; Gollum, an enervated slave to ""my precious"", most starkly portrays power's dehumanizing capacity.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
