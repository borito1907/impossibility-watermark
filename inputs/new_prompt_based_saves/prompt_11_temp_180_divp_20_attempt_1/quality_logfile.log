Feedback: The response provided addresses the instructions well, discussing various strategies for handling a customer complaint about a defective product. It covers all key points, including listening attentively, apologizing sincerely, gathering information, offering solutions, empathizing, explaining the cause, escalating matters if necessary, implementing solutions, and following up. The language is clear, and the response demonstrates coherence and relevance throughout. However, there are minor issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. Specifically, the response could benefit from more formal language and the removal of some redundant phrases, such as "of the product" and "who contacted." Moreover, there is a lack of transition between the main points, which sometimes makes the flow of the response feel disjointed. Despite these minor flaws, the response is effective, and its content is accurate and helpful for handling customer complaints.
