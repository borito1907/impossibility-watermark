**I. Preparation**

1. Ensure the vaccine and all necessary supplies are readily available.
2. Review the patient's medical history, AEs (adverse events) and allergies.
3. Verify the patient's identity and confirm their consent.

**II. Preparation of Vaccine and Supplies**

1. Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or freezer according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Inspect the vaccine vial for any visible signs of damage or contamination.
3. Gather necessary supplies, to include:
	* Sterile needles and syringes (in the appropriate size).
	* Band-Aids or gauze pads.
	* An alcohol swab.
	* Gloves (optional).

**III. Administration Procedure**

1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling the vaccine.
2. Identify the correct injection site (deltoid muscle of the upper arm).
3. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab.
4. Remove the needle cover, **only when ready to administer the vaccine**.
5. Hold the syringe at a 90-degree angle, the deltoid muscle, and insert the needle at the pre-designated injection site.
6. **Intramuscular Injection:** slowly inject the vaccine while gently pulling back on the plunger to ensure no blood return (0.5 mL for adult dose).",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
