Feedback: This essay effectively addresses the role of power in the Lord of the Rings series by providing specific examples of characters who embody different aspects of this theme. The response demonstrates coherence and relevance throughout, with minimal repetition. However, there are a few minor errors in grammar, such as the misplaced semicolon in the second sentence, and some inconsistencies in punctuation, like the lack of a comma after "Conversely" in the third paragraph. While these issues do not significantly impair the overall quality of the essay, they suggest a need for attention to detail in future revisions.

The essay maintains a strong focus on the topic, analyzing the impact of power on various characters and drawing insightful conclusions about its corrupting influence. However, it could benefit from a more explicit introduction and conclusion that clearly outline the main argument and tie it back to the broader context of the series. Additionally, the essay might be enhanced by incorporating direct quotations from the source material to support its points.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the essay exhibits a high level of understanding and engagement with the theme of power in the Lord of the Rings series. It effectively uses character analysis to explore the complexities of this theme, making it a compelling and informative read.
