Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm that they are receiving the correct vaccine.
* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Ensure the vaccination area is clean and free of clutter.

**II. Prepare the Vaccine**

* Check the expiration date and integrity of the vaccine vial.
* Remove the cap from the vial and swirl the contents gently to ensure the powder (if applicable) is fully dissolved.
* Withdraw the correct dose into the syringe according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm that they are receiving the correct vaccine.
* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Ensure the vaccination area is clean and free of clutter.

**II. Prepare the Vaccine**

* Check the expiration date and integrity of the vaccine vial.
* Remove the cap from the vial and swirl the contents gently to ensure the powder (if applicable) is fully dissolved.
* Withdraw the correct dose into the syringe according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**III. Administer the Vaccine**

* Identify the appropriate administration site, as determined by the patient's age and health status:
	+ Deltoid muscle of the upper arm for adults and children >  = 3 years old.

You are a helpful personal assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm that they are receiving the correct vaccine.
* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Ensure the vaccination area is clean and free of clutter.

**II. Prepare the Vaccine**

* Check the expiration date and integrity of the vaccine vial.
* Remove the cap from the vial and swirl the contents gently to ensure the powder (if applicable) is fully dissolved.
* Withdraw the correct dose into the syringe according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**III. Administer the Vaccine**

* Identify the appropriate administration site, as determined by the patient's age and health status:
	+ Deltoid muscle of the upper arm for adults and children >  = 3 years old.
	+ Anterolateral thigh for infants and toddlers < 3 years old.
* Clean the skin at the injection site with an antimicrobial swipe or alcohol pad.

[2024-06-18 03:54:55,475][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: * Hold the needle at a 90-degree angle, pointing straight into the skin.
