Debate whether students should have a role in curriculum design, citing potential benefits and drawbacks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The debate about whether students should have a role in curriculum design is a contentious issue that has sparked intense discussion among educators, (1) policymakers, administrators, and scholars. While some argue that student involvement can bring numerous benefits,  to the learning process, (2) others contend that it may lead to undesirable outcomes.

On one hand, there are several compelling reasons why students should be involved in curriculum design. Firstly,2019 research suggests that when students are given a voice in shaping their educational experience they tend to feel more invested and motivated in their studies.
