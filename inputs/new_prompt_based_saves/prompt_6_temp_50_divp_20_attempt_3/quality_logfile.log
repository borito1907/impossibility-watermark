The response shows a good understanding of the complexities involved in curriculum design, outlining the potential benefits such as increased student motivation and engagement, as well as the drawbacks, like the possibility of students lacking the necessary expertise to make informed decisions.

However, there are a few minor issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy. For instance, the transition between the introduction and the first argument could be smoother.

These minor issues, while not severely impacting the overall quality of the response, still prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

Considering these points, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents well-structured arguments. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the response deserves a score of 4.
