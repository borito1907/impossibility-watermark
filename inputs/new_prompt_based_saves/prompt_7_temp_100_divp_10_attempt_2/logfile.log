Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their consent to receive the vaccination.
* Review the patient's medical history, (e.g., allergies, (especially egg allergy), immunocompromised status, ICD-10 codes, (e.g., V04.81).
* Ensure the correct vaccine dose and formulation are prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their consent to receive the vaccination.
* Review the patient's medical history, (e.g., allergies, (especially egg allergy), immunocompromised status, ICD-10 codes, (e.g., V04.81).
* Ensure the correct vaccine dose and formulation are prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their consent to receive the vaccination.
* Review the patient's medical history, (e.g., allergies, (especially egg allergy), immunocompromised status, ICD-10 codes, (e.g., V04.81).
* Ensure the correct vaccine dose and formulation are prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**II. Administering the Vaccine**

1. **Choose the injection site**: Typically, A The deltoid muscle of the upper arm (laterally) is used for adults and older children.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their consent to receive the vaccination.
* Review the patient's medical history, (e.g., allergies, (especially egg allergy), immunocompromised status, ICD-10 codes, (e.g., V04.81).
* Ensure the correct vaccine dose and formulation are prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**II. Administering the Vaccine**

1. **Choose the injection site**: Typically, A The deltoid muscle of the upper arm (laterally) is used for adults and older children.
2. **Cleanse the skin**: Use an alcohol wipe or swab to clean the area where the injection will be given.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their consent to receive the vaccination.
* Review the patient's medical history, (e.g., allergies, (especially egg allergy), immunocompromised status, ICD-10 codes, (e.g., V04.81).
* Ensure the correct vaccine dose and formulation are prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**II. Administering the Vaccine**

1. **Choose the injection site**: Typically, A The deltoid muscle of the upper arm (laterally) is used for adults and older children.
2. **Cleanse the skin**: Use an alcohol wipe or swab to clean the area where the injection will be given.
3. **Administer the vaccine**:
	* Use a sterile, It 25-gauge needle (or smaller) and inject the recommended dose (usually 't 0.5 mL for adults and older children) intramuscularly (into the muscle).
	* Inject at a 90-degree angle to the skin, using a quick, smooth motion.
