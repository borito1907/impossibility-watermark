Discuss strategies for handling a customer complaint about a defective product.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

An essential topic in customer service! Handling customer complaints professionally and efficiently is crucial to maintain trust, or even turn a negative experience into a positive one. Here are some strategies for effectively managing a customer complaint about a defective product:

**1. Acknowledge and Apologize**

Recognize the customer's frustration and apologize for the inconvenience caused by the defective product. This shows empathy and a commitment to making things right.

Example: "I'm so sorry to hear that you've experienced issues with our product. We're committed to providing high-quality products, and it appears we fell short this time."
