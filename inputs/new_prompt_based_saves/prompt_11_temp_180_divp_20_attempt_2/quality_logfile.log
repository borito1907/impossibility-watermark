Feedback: The response is comprehensive and well-structured, covering essential strategies for handling a customer complaint about a defective product. The examples provided for each strategy further illustrate the approach in a practical scenario.

The first strategy, acknowledging and apologizing, is an excellent starting point for addressing the customer's frustration. It sets a positive tone and displays empathy. The second strategy, gathering information, emphasizes the importance of understanding the issue thoroughly, and asking clarifying questions is a valuable technique. The third strategy, staying calm and empathetic, reminds customer service representatives to maintain their composure during potentially stressful interactions, while the fourth strategy was not provided, leaving the response incomplete.

In terms of the scoring rubric, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic with a coherent and relevant discussion. The language used is appropriate and mostly free of errors, although there are a couple of minor punctuation issues. Therefore, while the omission of the fourth strategy slightly detracts from the response's completeness, it still adheres to the instructions with high standards of grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy.

Taking these factors into account, the response receives a score of 4, as it effectively addresses the instructions with minor issues in the rubric categories.
Score: 4
