Feedback: The response provided addresses the instruction effectively, presenting six coherent and relevant strategies for handling a customer complaint about a defective product. Each strategy is clearly defined and contributes to a comprehensive approach for resolving the issue. The use of headings adds structure to the response, improving its readability.

Grammar is generally correct, and there are minimal capitalization and punctuation errors. Sentence structure and flow are good, ensuring the response is easy to understand and follow. Furthermore, the response maintains a professional tone throughout, contributing to its overall quality.

Despite these strengths, there are a few minor inaccuracies in the text. For example, under the 'Empower Employees' section, the response mentions offering "in-store credits", which may not always be feasible for online businesses. Similarly, in the 'Follow-up and Follow-through' section, the response states "schedule follow-up communications", without specifying how this should be done, leaving room for ambiguity.

Taking into account the response's alignment with the instruction, its strong organization, and the minimal issues in grammar and coherence, the response earns a score of 4 out of 5.
