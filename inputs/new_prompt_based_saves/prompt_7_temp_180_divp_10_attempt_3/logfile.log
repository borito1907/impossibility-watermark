III.Administering The Vaccine

* Choose the correct dosage and formulation of the influenza vaccine according to CDC guidelines (e.g., trivalent or quadrivalent, children or adults)
* Use proper injection technique:*
    - Adults: inject in the deltoid muscle of the arm (2.5-3 inches below the acromion process) at a 90-degree angle *
      - Children aged =36 months: inject in the vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh, or in the deltoid muscle as the patient gets older*
      - For both sites: inject the vaccine slowly over 1-2 seconds; release quickly upon completion *
      -* Massage the injection site after removing the needle*

IV.Post-Vaccine Care 

* Observe the patient for at least 15 minutes to monitor for potential anaphylaxis reaction or syncope*
       If symptoms occur provide first aid if symptoms severe: call emergency number*
        * Document all administered vaccinations accurately and completely, including recording Lot Number*, dose and administration site on* Immunization registry records Vaccine Administration Record VARS*
          * Dispose needles and materials properly 
         * Discuss further follow-up and care instructions*
                Note: Based on current CDC guidelines from Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices 2020-2021assistant

IV Vaccine Administration (Injection)

* Use clean gloves when handling needles or injection devices (optional).
* Select the correct dosage based on the patient's age and size Determine the anatomically correct site deltoid muscle upper arm for patients weighing more than18 kg (40 pounds) Consider alternating arms to reduce soreness 
* Locate landmarks identify an injection location Avoid areas With excessive scar tissue moles blood vessels nervous structures sensitive areas visible bruising Perform Universal Precautions: wear nonsterile examination gloves handle needles like sharps grasp the syringe like a pencil 
* Cleanse the skin with a fresh alcohol wipe Hold the alcohol swab 1-2 inches away Spray it from back to front Hold it in contact for one sec 
* Administer the vaccine Use rapid needle insertion angled about at 900 (almost perpendicular) Insert needle within anatomical lines to diminish surface visibility inject solution quickly but slowly enough to control pressure Use moderate firm gentle smooth motion Remove air bubble Needle level slightly to sides 3 mm away Hold back stop 10seconds count then slowly pull the injected needle Remove in forward direction holding onto gauze Dispose of sharps as per protocol 

V Aftercare 

Ensure the needle is disposed of correctly.
