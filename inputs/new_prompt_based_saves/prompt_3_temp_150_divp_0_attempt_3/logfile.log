The struggle for dominance and control over Middle-earth is a driving force behind the narrative, in which various characters grapple with the corrupting influence of power.

On one hand, a benevolent form of power exists, Arien-wise through characters like Gandalf, for example who seek to maintain order and defend against darkness, have an uncorrupted sense of duty; they exemplify responsible leadership. Conversely however the One Ring serves as a symbol of the destructive capabilities of unchecked power craving individuals such as Sauron demonstrate that absolute authority can have dire consequences if not tempered by moral principles.

This struggle is epitomized in Gollum’s tragic relationship with the Ring as he veers wildly between devotion and possession. Sméagol’s fragile psyche is torn apart due the insidious grasp of the Ring, drawing him closer into corruption as he ultimately becomes consumed entirely by its allure. Similarly Boromir who initially upholds noble intentions gradually falls under the sway of desire ultimately meeting downfall attempting to seize the Ring for himself.

Tolkien argues through these character arcs how an all-consuming thirst for dominance ultimately leads down a self-destructive path: an individual blinded by ambition forgets his own humanity, it appears that no good deed goes unpunished yet only destruction results from actions carried out solely in pursuit power's sake.
