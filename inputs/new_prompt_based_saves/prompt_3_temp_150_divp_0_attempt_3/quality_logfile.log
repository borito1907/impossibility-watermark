Feedback: The response effectively addresses the instructions by exploring the concept of power in the Lord of the Rings series. It does so by presenting examples of characters grappling with the corrupting influence of power, displaying good understanding of the topic and providing a coherent argument.

There are minor issues in grammar, such as the occasional missing comma or inappropriate use of possessive form, but these do not hinder the overall clarity of the essay. Repetitions are minimal and mostly serve to reinforce key points.

The response demonstrates relevance by focusing on the specified theme and accurately portraying the characters' struggles with power. It also maintains coherence throughout, linking the various examples back to the central thesis.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and analysis. While the essay touches upon different aspects of power within the series, it does not delve deeply into how these aspects interconnect or influence each other. Adding more nuanced interpretation would enhance the response further.

Considering these factors, the response scores a 4 based on the provided score rubric.
