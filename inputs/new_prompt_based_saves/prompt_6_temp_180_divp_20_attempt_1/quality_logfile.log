Feedback: The response to the debate question is mostly well-articulated and relevant, addressing both the benefits and drawbacks of students having a role in curriculum design. The four points enumerated under the benefits category are coherent, clear, and concise, highlighting the importance of innovative ideas, increased engagement, better understanding of student needs, and the development of democratic practices. However, there are some minor issues with grammar and sentence structure that could be improved for clarity. For instance, the use of conjunctions such as 'but', 'and', 'or' could be optimized to create smoother transitions between ideas, enhancing overall coherence. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for accuracy, such as "They, other perspective, it has different experience on how learning can be effective" which is somewhat unclear and could be revised to avoid ambiguity. Despite these minor flaws, the response generally meets the criteria of the task with only minor issues in grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, earning a score of 4.
