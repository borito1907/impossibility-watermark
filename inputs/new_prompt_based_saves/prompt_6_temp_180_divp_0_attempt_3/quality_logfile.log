Feedback: The response provides a solid argument for the inclusion of students in curriculum design, offering clear and organized points under both benefits and drawbacks. It demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter and remains relevant throughout. However, the drawbacks section feels incomplete, with only one point presented. This imbalance in the argument structure slightly detracts from the overall quality. In terms of grammar and coherence, the response is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with sentence structure and word choice. These do not significantly impact the clarity of the argument but could be improved for better flow. Therefore, while the response is informative and coherent, addressing the instructions well, the incomplete drawbacks section and minor grammatical issues prevent it from achieving the highest score.
Score: 4
