It represents the corrupting influence of unchecked authority, as those who come into contact with it become consumed by its promise of dominance.

The struggle for power is a recurring theme throughout the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. On one hand, there are those who seek to wield power for their own gain, such as Saruman and Gollum, while others like Gandalf and Aragorn strive to harness it for the greater good. Even Frodo, initially innocent and naive, eventually finds himself succumbing to the Ring's insidious allure, tempted by its promise of protection and strength.

Tolkien masterfully explores the darker aspects of power, to reveal its corrosive effects on individuals and societies alike. As characters grapple with the burden of leadership, responsibility, and temptation they undergo profound transformations. Meanwhile, the very fabric of Middle-earth itself begins to unravel under the strain of conflicting interests and ideologies.

Ultimately, Tolkien posits that true power lies not in domination or coercion but rather in selflessness, compassion, and wisdom.
