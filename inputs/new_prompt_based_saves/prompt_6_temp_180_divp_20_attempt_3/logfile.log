Debate whether students should have a role in curriculum design, citing potential benefits and drawbacks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The age-old question of whether students should have a say in curriculum design! Let's dive into the pros and cons of involving students in this process.

**Pros:**

1. **Increased student engagement**: By giving students a voice in curriculum design, and allowing them to take an active role in shaping their education, (they become more invested in the learning process.

Debate whether students should have a role in curriculum design, citing potential benefits and drawbacks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The age-old question of whether students should have a say in curriculum design! Let's dive into the pros and cons of involving students in this process.

**Pros:**

1. **Increased student engagement**: By giving students a voice in curriculum design, and allowing them to take an active role in shaping their education, (they become more invested in the learning process.
2. **Relevant content**: Students are often better equipped to identify what topics are most relevant to their lives and interests, so that a curriculum designed with student input will have a higher degree of significance and connection for them,
3. **Improve retention**: Incorporating student perspectives can lead to curricula that better address  the various ways learn- including differentiating instruction.
