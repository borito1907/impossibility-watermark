Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has provided informed consent and has been screened for any contraindications to receiving the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands with soap and water, at least 20 seconds before handling the vaccine or administering the injection.
* Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves if desired.

**II. Identifying the Patient and the Vaccine**

* Verify the patient's identity using their name, date of birth, and other identifiable information.
* Check the vaccine vial or pre-filled syringe for the correct type (e.g., trivalent or quadrivalent), dose, Itypename and lot number.
* Ensure the vaccine is not expired or past its recommended storage time.
