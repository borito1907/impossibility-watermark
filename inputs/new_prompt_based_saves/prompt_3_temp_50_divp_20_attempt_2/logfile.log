[2024-06-17 23:12:43,018][watermarker][INFO] - Received completion: In J.R.R. Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings series, power is a pervasive and complex theme that drives the narrative forward. The struggle for power is a dominant force that shapes the characters, actions and ultimately determines the fate of Middle-earth.

The primary symbol of power in the series is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron to enslave and dominate all other rings of power. The Ring's corrupting influence is evident in the way it consumes those who come into contact with it, to the point where even the strongest wills are broken. Boromir's failed attempt to take the Ring from Frodo exemplifies this, as his desire to use its power for good ultimately leads him down a path of destruction.

On the other hand, the Elves, wisdom and knowledge represent a different kind of power - one rooted in harmony with nature and respect for the natural order. Galadriel's leadership and guidance serve as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that true power comes not from domination but from understanding and cooperation.

The character of Gollum serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power. Once a hobbit named Sméagol, he was consumed by the Ring's influence and transformed into a creature driven solely by a desire for possession and control.
