Feedback: The response provides arguments for and against student involvement in curriculum design, addressing the instructions. However, there are noticeable issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy that impact the overall quality.

Firstly, the response contains grammatical errors such as "on the hand," "actively participating in the development if their educational syllabus," and "when we permit youngsters contribute their inputs." These errors affect the clarity and readability of the text. Additionally, there are multiple repetitions of phrases like "to certain objectives" and "students be a role," which hinder coherence.

Capitalization and punctuation errors are also present throughout the response, such as "When students actively participating in the development if their educational syllabus" and "Curriculum  designs are often developed remotely away from the concerns." These errors further detract from the response's quality.

Relevance is another issue, as some points, such as "building stronger student - teacher relationships," only tangentially relate to the core question of whether students should have a role in curriculum design.

Lastly, while the response touches on the benefits and drawbacks, it does not delve deeply into the subject matter, missing opportunities to provide more compelling and accurate arguments.

In conclusion, the response generally addresses the instructions but has moderate issues with grammar, coherence, relevance, and accuracy, leading to an overall lower quality.
