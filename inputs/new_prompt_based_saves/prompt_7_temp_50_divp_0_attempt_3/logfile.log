Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.

[2024-06-18 04:32:23,489][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: * Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.
* Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.
* Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

**III.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.
* Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

**III. Patient Preparation**

* Position the patient in a comfortable seated or lying position, with their arm relaxed at their side.
* Identify the injection site: typically the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (middle third of the arm).

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.
* Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

**III. Patient Preparation**

* Position the patient in a comfortable seated or lying position, with their arm relaxed at their side.
* Identify the injection site: typically the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (middle third of the arm).
* Cleanse the skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.
* Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

**III. Patient Preparation**

* Position the patient in a comfortable seated or lying position, with their arm relaxed at their side.
* Identify the injection site: typically the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (middle third of the arm).
* Cleanse the skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab.

**IV.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

* Ensure the patient has a completed consent form and medical history questionnaire.
* Verify the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, (or use hand sanitizer).
* Put on new gloves.

**II. Vaccine Preparation**

* Select the appropriate flu vaccine dose and formulation for the patient's age group.
* Check the expiration date of the vaccine.
* Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator or storage unit.
* Allow the vaccine to come to room temperature (if necessary).

**III. Patient Preparation**

* Position the patient in a comfortable seated or lying position, with their arm relaxed at their side.
* Identify the injection site: typically the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (middle third of the arm).
* Cleanse the skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab.

**IV. Administration**

* Hold the syringe at a 90-degree angle to the skin.
