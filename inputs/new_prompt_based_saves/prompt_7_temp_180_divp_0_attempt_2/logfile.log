Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**Pre-Administration Steps**

1. **Screening and Consent**: Verify the patient's identity, in accordance with organizational policies. Review the patient's medical history, an any contraindications to the vaccine. Obtain informed consent from the patient before administering the vaccine.

2. **Prepare the Vaccine**: Check the expiration date and integrity of the vaccine vial. Wash your hands with soap and water, as well as sanitize them with an alcohol-based hand rub.

**Administration**

3. **Select the Injection Site**: Choose a clean,{\}, dry area on the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (or according to specific product inserts), avoiding areas of skin breakdown or scarring.
