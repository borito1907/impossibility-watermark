Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Verify the patient's identity and ensure they have a valid consent form signed.
* Review the patient's medical history, (e.g., allergies,.egg allergies) and ensure they are eligible to receive the flu vaccine.
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
* Prepare the necessary equipment:
	+ Vaccine vial or prefilled syringe containing the influenza vaccine.
	+ Sterile needles and syringes in various sizes.
	+ Alcohol pads or swabs.
	+ Gloves (if not using a dedicated immunization station).
	+ Trash receptacle for disposing of needles and other waste.
