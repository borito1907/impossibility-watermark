[2024-06-17 23:45:23,176][watermarker][INFO] - Received completion: In J.R.R. Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings series, the concept of power is a pervasive and complex theme that drives the plot forward. The struggle for power is a central motif, explored through various characters, realms, and ideologies.

On one hand, the pursuit of power can lead to corruption and destruction. This is epitomized by Sauron,s ultimate goal of domination over Middle-earth. His insatiable lust for power is rooted in his desire for control and conquest, even if it means destroying all that is good in the world. Similarly, to a lesser extent Boromir falls prey to this temptation as he tries to take the One Ring from Frodo tempted by its supposed ability to save Gondor.

However power can also be wielded for the greater good as exemplified by the wise wizard Gandalf's guidance and protection. In contrast Gandalf's authority is tempered with humility wisdom and the desire to help others rather than seeking to exploit or dominate them. Another example is Aragorn who wields his authority as King Elessar not out of personal ambition but rather as a commitment to serve and protect his people.

Furthermore the series highlights how different structures of power shape the societies they govern. From the feudal monarchies of Rohan and Gondor to the elven realms and the dark domain of Mordor each society reflects the values and priorities of those holding power.
