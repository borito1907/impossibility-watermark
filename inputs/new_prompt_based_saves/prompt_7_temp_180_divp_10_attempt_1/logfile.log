Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Preparation**

1. Ensure the patient has scheduled an appointment and completed any necessary consent forms.
2. Review the patient's medical history, at risk groups (e.g., older adults,2020 pediatric populations).
3.Ready the vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions (e.g., thawing frozen vaccines).
