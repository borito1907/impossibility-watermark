Feedback: The response effectively addresses the instructions, presenting both arguments for and against the proposition that students should have a role in curriculum design. The proponents' argument emphasizes the importance of student agency, the value of students' perspectives as learners, and the potential development of professional skills. However, there is room for improvement in terms of the counterargument. While the response correctly identifies potential downsides, such as a lack of expertise and possible misalignment with fundamental educational principles, it could delve deeper into these concerns to strengthen the opposition to student involvement in curriculum design.

Moreover, the response could be enhanced by providing more concrete examples of the benefits and drawbacks mentioned. This would increase the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments presented.

Grammatically, the response is mostly accurate, although minor issues such as missing commas in compound sentences are present. Repetition is minimal, and coherence is generally maintained throughout the response.

In conclusion, the response meets most of the criteria set forth in the score rubric, but could benefit from further exploration of the counterarguments and more specific examples to strengthen its points.
