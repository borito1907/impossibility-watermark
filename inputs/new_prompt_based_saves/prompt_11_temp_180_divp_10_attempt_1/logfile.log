As a helpful personal assistant, to efficiently handle a customer's claim regarding your store, (your/our) goods' defects can do wonders in preserving both the customers confidence while also keeping you on their favorable list! Here's a well-structured strategy:

**Listen Actively and Empathize**: Whenever (customer/the user/complaint is lodged against), you or staff get notification of an issue related to products that malfunction/misbehavior, for a proper remedy:
   **Hear The Issue -**: Carefully listen through details shared & gather specificities of defect & product's specifications; maintain records (digital/write-up notes)

Empathize with users frustration due partly from time/effort lost dealing with your items that do not conform to desired quality.
