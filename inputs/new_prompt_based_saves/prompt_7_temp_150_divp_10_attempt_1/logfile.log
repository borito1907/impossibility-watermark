Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Pre-Vaccination Preparation**

1. **Screening**: Review the patient's medical history,ing allergy to eggs,. or if they have had a previous adverse reaction to a flu vaccine.
2. **Obtain Informed Consent**: Get the patient's consent before administering the vaccine.
3. **Prepare Equipment**: Ensure all necessary equipment is available,{\|} including a sterile needle, (syringe), alcohol swabs, sanitizer|}, and a trash can.

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**I. Pre-Vaccination Preparation**

1. **Screening**: Review the patient's medical history,ing allergy to eggs,. or if they have had a previous adverse reaction to a flu vaccine.
2. **Obtain Informed Consent**: Get the patient's consent before administering the vaccine.
3. **Prepare Equipment**: Ensure all necessary equipment is available,{\|} including a sterile needle, (syringe), alcohol swabs, sanitizer|}, and a trash can.

**II. Vaccine Administration**

1. **Identify the Correct Vaccine**: Check the label to ensure you're using the correct type and dosage of flu vaccine.
