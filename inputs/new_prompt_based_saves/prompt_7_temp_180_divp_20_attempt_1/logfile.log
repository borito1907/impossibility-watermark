Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Pre-Vaccination Preparation

* Verify the patient's identity and ensure they are eligible to receive the flu vaccine (check age, even if it seems obvious, for adults)
* Review their medical history,ing the patient's medical history, who have an egg allergy or history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)) 
* Answer any questions or concerns the patient may have

II. Vaccine Preparation

* Obtain the appropriate dosages and formulations of the flu vaccine according to the patient's age, in line with current CDC recommendations 
* Ensure the vaccine is stored at the correct temperature and is not past its expiration date 
* Wash your hands thoroughly before handling the vaccine
