Feedback: The response given is coherent, relevant, and provides a clear understanding of strategies for handling customer complaints about defective products. Each point is well-explained and aligns with the task at hand. However, there are a few minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as the unnecessary use of commas in sentences and occasional lack of capitalization in the beginning of new sentences. These issues do not significantly affect the overall quality or understanding of the response, but they detract from the flawless execution that would be necessary for a perfect score. Therefore, while this response is strong, it falls short of a perfect score due to these minor issues.
