Feedback: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of how to handle customer complaints regarding defective products and presents well-structured strategies to address these concerns. It begins by emphasizing the importance of listening and acknowledging the customer's complaint, followed by advising to offer a sincere apology. These points are directly relevant to the instructions and are presented coherently.

The response then moves on to suggest gathering information about the defective product, showing an awareness of the need for thoroughness in addressing customer issues. Lastly, it briefly touches upon the determination of the severity of the defect and outlines possible next steps based on company policies and consumer protection laws.

The response has minor issues in coherence and relevance due to the incomplete last point, which lacks clear guidance on how to proceed once the severity of the defect is determined. Additionally, there are minor grammatical errors and capitalization mistakes, such as missing commas after introductory phrases and the lack of capitalization in some proper nouns like 'phone' and 'email'.

Despite these shortcomings, the response still adequately addresses the instructions, and its minor errors do not significantly detract from its overall quality. Based on this evaluation, the response earns a score of 4.
