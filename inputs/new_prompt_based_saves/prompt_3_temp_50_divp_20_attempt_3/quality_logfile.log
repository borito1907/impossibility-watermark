This use of specific examples enhances the coherence and relevance of the essay, making it more engaging and informative for the reader.

However, the response contains a few minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as the missing comma after "Boromir" in the second paragraph. While these issues do not significantly impair the overall quality of the essay, they do detract slightly from its clarity and professionalism. Additionally, some sentences could benefit from being rephrased for improved coherence and flow.

Despite these minor flaws, the essay effectively communicates its main points and remains relevant and accurate throughout. It demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter and presents a well-structured argument regarding the role of power in The Lord of the Rings series.
