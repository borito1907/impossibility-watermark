As a helpful personal assistant, AIs I must inform you that in the context of education system student involvement in curriculum design is debatable topic Let's weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks to explore this further

Benefits:

1 Improved Relevance: By involving students in curriculum design they can ensure that the material taught is relevant applicable to their lives interests Students are more likely to engage when they see value in what they're learning making them more motivated

2 Enhanced Autonomy: Student participation allows them to take ownership over their education Encouraging them to make informed decisions about their academic path Empowering them with choices regarding what they want to learn when and how This increased autonomy could also translate to improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills

3 Diverse Perspectives Students bring unique views point out gaps omissions and bias which educators or administrators might overlook Having students contribute helps ensure inclusivity covers contemporary issues reflects modern world effectively preparing them for an ever changing society Students may highlight topics or themes often omitted due race gender cultural religious social-economic backgrounds disabilities etc

4 Informed Decisions: Educators may hold certain biases based on outdated methods texts resources student consultation keeps curriculum fresh relevant By incorporating feedback on what works or fails within courses ensures curriculums adapt evolve better suit contemporary young learners Educators stay informed aware challenges that today's youth face ensuring more responsive support

Drawbacks:

1 Inequity and Biases Students lack objectivity professional insight into pedagogy teaching methodologies as opposed education experts educators Hence including only their opinions create biased perspectives disregarding essential concepts principles Furthermore there may be peer influences rather objective consideration thus not considering all needs voices

2 Lack Expertise While some individual students hold impressive subject specific prowess the majority require formal guidance The entire cohort can't grasp abstract educational objectives like curriculum standards quality control It would demand immense training investments to adequately involve students which currently appears economically impractical Educators understand complex interplays between subjects levels departments that define effective holistic development something hard to delegate

3 Unrealistic Timelines Student input may hinder decision-making timelines creating resource pressures and delays It can become unrealistic and impractical especially considering current teacher loads administrative paperwork requirements Students juggle commitments alongside academics work-life thus compromising timeliness efficiency Implementing modifications need well-structured management

4 Limited Perspective Educational pathways are long-term processes students have short- attention spans hence limited focus Students primarily care about immediate results instant applicability Curriculum design requires vision planning beyond short term goals towards shaping societal contributions professionals responsible carry greater perspective responsibility that should be taken seriously It cannot ignore vital skills for future jobs marketplaces yet unseen but crucial 

Now we've considered both the arguments in favour as against giving students' roles in designing curricula there remain two distinct angles What is needed is an adaptable structure fostering partnerships collaboration not replacements There should not be confusion here between inclusive discussion or empowerment and surrender to amateurish influence rather constructive integration respecting boundaries strengths weaknesses Professionals handle the overall strategy objectives educational theories whilst involving students provide practical ground-level relevance This joint approach promotes more meaningful learning experiences while preserving academic credibility 

If given the option I'd advocate adopting mechanisms incorporating regular forums workshops anonymous feedback systems surveys digital portals even AI mediated communication platforms allowing fluid exchange This collaborative model balances student participation without overriding professional expertise providing both agency autonomy & maintaining core academic integrity Remember the goal education evolves young minds fosters growth & progress What better way than together?
