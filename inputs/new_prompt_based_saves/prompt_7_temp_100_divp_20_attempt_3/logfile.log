Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Ensure the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Review the patient's medical history, Influenza Vaccination (flu shot) consent form.
* Prepare the vaccination area with necessary supplies, (e.g., gloves, syringes, A vaccination record cards).
* Check the expiration date of the flu vaccine and ensure it is stored at the correct temperature.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Ensure the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Review the patient's medical history, Influenza Vaccination (flu shot) consent form.
* Prepare the vaccination area with necessary supplies, (e.g., gloves, syringes, A vaccination record cards).
* Check the expiration date of the flu vaccine and ensure it is stored at the correct temperature.

II. Administration

* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.

[2024-06-18 06:27:30,659][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: * Put on new pair of gloves.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Ensure the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Review the patient's medical history, Influenza Vaccination (flu shot) consent form.
* Prepare the vaccination area with necessary supplies, (e.g., gloves, syringes, A vaccination record cards).
* Check the expiration date of the flu vaccine and ensure it is stored at the correct temperature.

II. Administration

* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
* Put on new pair of gloves.
* Open the flu vaccine vial or package according to the manufacturer's instructions.
* Draw up the correct dose of vaccine into the syringe.
* Remove the needle cap and prepare the injection site.
* Identify the deltoid muscle in the upper arm (or alternative injection site if needed).

[2024-06-18 06:32:50,114][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: * Inject the vaccine intramuscularly at a 90-degree angle, the recommended injection site.

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Ensure the patient's identity and confirm their eligibility to receive the flu vaccine.
* Review the patient's medical history, Influenza Vaccination (flu shot) consent form.
* Prepare the vaccination area with necessary supplies, (e.g., gloves, syringes, A vaccination record cards).
* Check the expiration date of the flu vaccine and ensure it is stored at the correct temperature.

II. Administration

* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
* Put on new pair of gloves.
* Open the flu vaccine vial or package according to the manufacturer's instructions.
* Draw up the correct dose of vaccine into the syringe.
* Remove the needle cap and prepare the injection site.
* Identify the deltoid muscle in the upper arm (or alternative injection site if needed).
* Inject the vaccine intramuscularly at a 90-degree angle, the recommended injection site.
* Hold the syringe in place for a few seconds before withdrawing the needle.
* Dispose of the used needle and syringe in a puncture-resistant container.
