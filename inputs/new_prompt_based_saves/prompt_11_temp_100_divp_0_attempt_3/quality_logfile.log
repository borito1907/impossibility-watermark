Feedback: The response adequately addresses the instructions, providing a comprehensive list of strategies for handling a customer complaint about a defective product. The points listed are relevant, clear, and follow a logical order, with a good balance between acknowledging the customer's concern, investigating the issue, and offering solutions. The language used is professional, courteous, and empathetic, which are essential qualities when dealing with customer complaints.

However, there are a few minor issues in grammar, coherence, and punctuation. For instance, there is a repetition of the word 'product' in the first two points, which could have been avoided for better flow. Also, the sentence 'These could include repairing or replacing the product,200 refunding the purchase price offering a store credit or providing a complimentary service.' is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity. Additionally, there are a couple of capitalization errors in the list items, which, although minor, detract slightly from the overall quality of the response.

Taking these points into consideration, the response meets most of the criteria outlined in the rubric but falls short of the highest standards due to the minor grammatical and punctuation errors. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4.
Score: 4
