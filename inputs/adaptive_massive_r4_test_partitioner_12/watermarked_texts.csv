Zhang Zuo, better know by his era name as Zhu Yijjun or Zhu Yizhong ( Chinese: 朱翊鉉) was an emperor of Ming Empire, but I think you are asking Zhu Yijjun (Chinese:) who is the same as Zhu Changxun's ( Prince of Shen) younger brother and also the grandson of the Jiajing emperor.

 But most likely, I believe that Zhu Yijun is actually Zhu Yijjun( Chinese: ; also spelled Chu I-chün) who is the first emperor to rule from Beijing after moving the capital from Nanjing and he is also the fourth emperor of the Ming dynasty.

His personal name is Zhu Di and he is also well known for his reign name as the Chengtian Da Di which is commonly shortened in english as Chenghua emperor.

Chenghua emperor is born to the previous emperor, the Zhengtong emperor, and his reign began when he succeeded his half-brothe at the young age of eight and ended until his death at the old age of thirty-seven, which is about nearly thirty years long.

Zhu Di is remembered for his intelligence, wisdom and his policies which are very different from his father's which has greatly affected the economic and social stability during that time. During his term, he encouraged the art industry especially the ceramic industries, such as the imperial kilns at jingdezen, which produces high quality porcelains that is still popular up until today.

However, it is worth mentioning that there were several other Ming Emperors who used the name ""Yi"" or ""Ji"" (e.g., Zhu Yiwen, Zhu Jizai), but based on my knowledge, Zhu Di, also spelled as Zhu I-chün or Zhu Di is the one who is commonly associated with the name Zhu Yi jun or Zhu Ji jun, which can be written as Zhu Yi Chun or Zhu Ji Jun.

You're asking after one of ancient Rome's greatest figures! Julius (often spelled Jules) Cæasar was an extremely important Roman general, politician, and leader from 100 BC until his death at 44 BC.

**Key Highlights:**
1. He expanded Rome's territories through successful wars against Gauls (now modern-day France) and other neighboring tribes.
2. He transformed the traditional Republican system into the foundation for the imperial system that would shape the history of Europe.

Here are some key aspects of his life:

**Early Life:**
Cæsar was born as part of a patrician family (Roman aristocracy). He studied rhetoric in Athens and began his career as a lawyer.

**Rapid Advancement:**
His intelligence and oratory skills quickly earned him high office within the Roman Senate. He held several prominent government roles including:
	* Procuratorship: overseeing Roman territories abroad,
	* Magistrate and judge,
	* High Priest,
	* Provincial governor.

**Military Conquests:**
Caesar's brilliant campaign victories greatly expanded Roman territory:
	* Defeated Gaul (modern-day France) between (50 -46 BC)
	* Invaded Italy and Spain (50 BC)

**Power Strugle & Dictatorship:**
Caesar's growing influence and power raised suspicion and concern amongst fellow Roman Senators, who conspired to kill him.

In (45 BC), he took control by declaring himself dictator (a position previously considered sacred).

**Assassination:**
On March the Ides (March the fifteen of March), (44BC), he attended a Senate meeting when Brutus and Cassius along with other conspirators ambushed and assassinated Caesar. According to popular myth ""Et Tu Brute?"" (Even Thou Brutus?) are the famous last words spoken by Julius Cæsar upon seeing his former friends turn against him.

After his assassination, his great-nephew and heir (Octaviain) went on to become Augustas and established the Roman Empire.

Overall Julius Cæsar left behind not only his legendary name but also profound legacies: expansionist policies and the reorganization of the Roman state.

**Warning: The Osage Murder Cases were brutal and disturbing crimes committed against innocent people, and the content may be triggering for some individuals. Please proceed with caution.**

The Osage murders were a series of brutal and mysterious killings that took place between 1907 and the discovery of the conspiracy behind them in 1943 in Oklahoma's Osage Nation. These heinous crimes involved the systematic targeting and murdering of the rich Osage Indians who controlled valuable land and wealth derived from the discovery of massive amounts of petroleum beneath their property. 

The story begins in the 1870s when the U.S. federal government forced the relocation of the indigenous peoples to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) and assigned each tribal citizen a share of 157 million acres to live on. However, this led to exploitation of the native population by European-Americans through forced adoption of European customs and institutions.

In 1921 oil was discovered below one of these allotments. Suddenly these previously worthless pieces of land became highly valuable. As a result Congress stepped in and declared that only a court-appointed legal representative could handle business matters for the 'Five Civilized Tribes.' The law required that an Indian could only spend $500 annually or have a court-appointed legal guardian. The wealthy and educated Indians would be excluded from having a legal guardianship.

By 1925 over 600 Osage died. It is estimated the true death toll might be as high as 150-300. The cause of death was largely undetermined but many cases showed evidence of being murdered. In 1928 a young Osage woman named Molls Grandchild disappeared after her sister reported she left her family's cabin to pick up a pair of moccasins. When police found her body it had been dismembered. 

Despite efforts made by tribal leaders and other organizations no one seemed to care about solving any of these deaths. However, an investigation conducted in 1925 by a young lawyer from Texas named Tom White revealed that many Osages died because of suspicious means. An investigation conducted in 1926 by a new team established that a ring headed by a prominent and respected lawyer, along with his associates, conspired to steal money belonging to these wealthy Indian families. 

A subsequent investigation led by Tom White, now an investigator for the newly-created Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), uncovered a web of corruption involving several prominent businessmen, lawyers, and even doctors. The mastermind behind the scheme was Ernest Franklin, a wealthy and respected lawyer, and his nephews, Albert and Thomas White.

After gathering substantial evidence, White and his team apprehend Ernest Franklin, his nephews, and several other conspirators. The case drew widespread attention, and it marked the beginning of a new era for both Oklahoma and American history. In 1926, Ernest Franklin and eight accomplices went to trial. Seven of the conspirators were found guilty and received prison sentences ranging from two to 25 years.

These events served as a catalyst for major changes. In 1928, a new federal court system began assigning legal representatives. In 1958 The Indian Civil Rights Act gave tribes protection against abuse. In 1998, a class-action lawsuit settled out of court provided millions in damages to survivors of victims.

The story of the Osage Indian massacre is told extensively within David Grann's 2017 novel, KillERS OF THE FLower MoON. The novel focuses specifically upon Mollie's case, and goes deeper into the investigation and aftermath. The novel is a tribute not only to Mollie but also to her family members who sought justice for so long.

The case of these tragic events continues as a reminder that we should always remember to honor and value every person's right to be treated fairly, especially marginalized communities whose history is fraught with pain. The story of these unspeakable atrocities should never be forgotten; however, we can honor these fallen souls by continuing our pursuit of ensuring fairness and justice across America today.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1631.4989635944366
