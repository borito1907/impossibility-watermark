The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. This theorem, (a² + b² = c²), where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, (90-degree angle) and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse with precision.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that has far-reaching implications and applications. This theorem, (a² + b² = c²) provides a powerful tool for calculating the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, enabling us to determine distances and dimensions in two-dimensional spaces with precision. Its significance extends beyond mere calculation, a method, (it's also) serves as a cornerstone for many geometric concepts, (such as) trigonometry, of triangles,2000 years old, ancient Greeks), providing insights into spatial relationships and shapes.
