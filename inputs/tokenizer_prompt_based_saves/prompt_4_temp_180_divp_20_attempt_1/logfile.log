The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that holds immense significance in understanding and analyzing geometric shapes, in particular, Aright triangles. At its core, in every right-angled triangle with legs a & b that meet to form another side commonly known as 'hypotenuse' (c), this theorem helps us deduce an inter-relationship  amongst them via one of those simplest yet profoundly insightful  geometic identities: c²=a²+b².
