3 Transition Support Crucial As mentioned earlier assisting impacted communities people who lose jobs workers and businesses during this changeover) through financial support training programs is quintessential Without these safeguards such transformations) might exacerbate localized poverty create regional unrest among population  

Final Thoughts:
1 Effective planning smoothens transition- Local administrations state government  private-public collaboration non-profits stakeholders engagement could help minimize disruption facilitate knowledge transfer ensure resources are properly distributed addressing immediate impacts  

Local governments would also need develop contingency plans that support residents losing their jobs providing income assistance skill retraining and incentivising entrepreneurship and new businesses.
