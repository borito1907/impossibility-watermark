The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that holds immense significance in various mathematical and real-world applications. This theorem, an ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, (c. 570-495 BCE) discovered, there exists a squared plus b squared equals c squared, (a² + b² = c²), where a and b represent the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c represents the length of its hypotenuse.
