The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that holds immense significance in understanding the relationships between lengths and angles in right-angled triangles. This theorem, (a² + b² = c²), coined by ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, over 2,500 years ago, an ingenious explanation for the square of the length of the hypotenuse side of a right triangle being equal to the sum of squares of its other two sides.

Here is a paragraph about the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:

The Pythagorean Theorem, (a² + b² = c²) plays a pivotal role in geometry as it provides a fundamental way to relate the lengths of sides in a right-angled triangle. This theorem is significant because it enables us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse (c) given the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).
