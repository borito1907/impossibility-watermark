1,"WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that promises to balance the federal budget in 10 years but faces rejection by the Democratic Senate and President Barack Obama.
The vote was 219-205, with 12 Republicans joining all Democrats in opposing the measure.
Ryan's plan would achieve balance through significant spending reductions and reforms to Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. The White House issued a statement calling it ""a recipe for disaster"" that would ""hurt our economy, hurt families and fail to reduce the deficit.""

While the proposal stands little chance of becoming law this year, it sets the tone for the coming presidential campaign season and provides a political platform for Republican candidates.

In the midst of a contentious election cycle, Republicans touted their plan as a bold effort to tackle the nation's fiscal woes, while Democrats accused them of trying to gut vital social safety-net programs.

""We're not just talking about numbers on a page; we're talking about people's lives,"" said Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee.

But Ryan countered, ""This is a pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-seniors' agenda. It gets our debt under control, it saves Medicare, it spurs economic growth.""

GOP leaders praised the Ryan plan as a fiscally responsible blueprint for tackling the national debt, which now exceeds $14 trillion.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
2,"WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., aimed at reversing the government's growing debt and deficits, but rejected several Democratic amendments that would have protected popular social programs.
The 2014 budget resolution, passed on a 221-207 vote, is not a binding spending bill and does not carry the force of law. Instead, it provides a vision for fiscal policy and sets the stage for further legislative battles over spending and taxes.
In contrast to previous years, when House Republican budgets faced intense opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans, this year's debate was more subdued. No Republican defected from party lines, while just two Democrats voted in favor of the resolution.
Ryan's budget, which aims to balance within 10 years by slashing federal spending, repealing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, and reining in Social Security benefits, was expected to pass narrowly along partisan lines.
Democrats offered a series of alternative proposals, most of which failed. One, sponsored by Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., would have restored $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts known as sequestration that are set to take effect under the Budget Control Act. Another, introduced by Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., would have blocked efforts to cut food stamps or impose work requirements on recipients.",semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
