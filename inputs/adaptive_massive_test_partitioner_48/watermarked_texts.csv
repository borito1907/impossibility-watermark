Zhang Zuo, commonly and incorrectly spelled as Zhu Yijin or Zhu Yizhong, was not an emperor of Ming but rather Zhu Yijin's name was never found among any Ming empress list, but one of his sons was Zhu Zaiyi (also spelled as Zhu Zaiyi). The name is also sometimes translated as Chu I-chün.

However, there are two notable figures from Ming era that might be related to the name ""Zhu Yijun"":

1. **Zhuming** (1355–1398), also known as Zhu Biao, who later became **Hongxi**'s father. His personal name was indeed ""Yujin"". 
2. **Zhuming** in another case, is also spelled **Zhu Di**, he is Zhu Di's father, Zhu Biao. Zhu Di is famously recognized for becoming **The Chenghua**'s father.

There was however an emperor of Ming that had 'Yijun' as part of their posthumous name: **Emperor Tianqiu** (also spelled as Tien-ch'iao) of Ming, born as Zhu Qiyue, also spelled **Choo Kee-yuet**.

**Emperor Tianqi** (also spelled as T'ien Ch'i) of Ming, born as Zhu **Youjian** (also spelled as Chu Yu-jên), also used ""Yijun"" as his personal name before he took power.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,247.79202246665955

June 4, 1898 and 1920 are not notable, but I think you meant 6/4/1898 or 6/4/1920 or possibly 6/4/86 or 6/4/91. If none of those years are correct then it is likely that you meant June Fourth or Tiananmen Square protests of June 3 to June 9, which culminating on the night of June 3-4 in Beijing's Tiananmen square.

The Tiananmen Square protests were protests led by university students, calling for political reform, an end to government censorship and freedom of speech and assembly and also against the Communist Party of China (CCP) government's authoritarian rule and widespread government nepotism.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,80.46589851379395

Banjalauka, which I believe you meant Banjalauka, got it's name from two Slavic word: 

1)  Ban (lord or master) 
  and 
  3) Luk(a) (meanders of a river).

Together they mean ""river of lord/master"". This name could be related to Vrbasa River that flows near this place and also because of medieval lordship. The area has had different names throughout time but this name started getting established at least as far back as Ottoman Empire rule.

If you are looking for information about Banja Luka, it seems you may be referring to Banja Luke, which located within Republiki Sipsraska, an entity of Bosna I Herzegovina, which got its name in same time frame as mentioned previously. It literally means ""Luke Baths"" or ""Luke Spa"". The name likely derived from baths/spas that were there along Vrbasa River, which runs through town, as well as from Luke, which can refer to a specific location or a local lord/master.

Would you like more details on Banja Luka or perhaps something else regarding Bosnia or Herzegovina? I am here to help! :)<|eot_id|>",97.99999594688416,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,178.33340191841125
