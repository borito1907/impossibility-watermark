You're asking why December 25, which commemoratesJesus' (often misspoken as""Jeuss"")  alleged  death and resurrection are not his real or exact  death or ressurection  but rather his  alleged  or supposed birth. The reason is that the calendar we commonly use, the Gregorian calendar, actually begins from January 1st, which is based on the traditional Roman calendar.

However, the celebration of December 31st is believed to be the winter solstice, which has roots in ancient pagan cultures. The winter solstice, which usually occurs between Dec. 21-25th marks the shortest day of the year, when daylight is at its least amount. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians, Persians, Celts, Germans, etc., had long-established rituals celebrating this time as the ""re-birth of the sun"", since it marked a point where days began growing longer, signaling the return of light, warmth, fertility and new life.

When the Roman Empire adopted Christianity, Pope Julian I decided to co-opt existing traditions, so he declared December 25th as the official celebration of the Nativity, which is now popularly recognized as the anniversary of Jesus Christ's conception or, more specifically, the Epiphany, which celebrates his baptism.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,207.15533638000488

An important retirement planning concept! The 4% withdrawal rate, or 4 Percent Draw Down Rate, was first introduced by investment professional and academic, David M Boddy, but popularly promoted by another investment professional, Charles Schwager's collaborerator Bill Bengelmann, then further popularized by financial planner, Michael Kitces.

The rule states that, to maintain one's retirement funds over time, it is generally recommended to withdraw not more than **approximately *$40 per $1000 of investments***. The withdrawal amount can increase each year for cost of living expenses.

For example if one had $1 million saved up at retirement, this rule implies that one would be able to spend $40,000 ($1,000,000 x *0.40) every year throughout a typical retirement. It assumes:

1.   Average annual returns: The investment mix will yield long-term returns of at least *7-8%, net after fees.*
2.   Long-term care: The retirees will not outlive retirement savings, as there are sufficient funds available.
3.   Taxes and fees: Tax rates and fees remain relatively stable and low.

Note that this rule applies to tax-efficient, diversified investment pools, not individual investments; and that other withdrawal rates may be used depending on market conditions. For instance some studies propose alternative withdrawal amounts based on age, health conditions, or market volatility, so it remains essential to consult financial advisor to determine optimal withdrawal rates.<|eot_id|>",99.55357313156128,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,247.32175040245056

However, I must clarify that there are different references of something similar-sounding, and I'll provide you information based available knowledge.

**Wikipedia's Reference**: The closest reference I found was related Star Citizen, an upcoming space simulation MMORP (online role-playing game) where one faction is mentioned: **United Empire of Eras**, but then I also read that another faction is actually what we are looking for - The UEE has an enemy faction known as... 

**the 'Xenothreat' or 'Vanguard' enemy factions' ally:** No. Not exactly. But close to it...
 It seems that there's no direct mention of this name, but, **a faction within a larger universe**,  The **United Galactic Coalition**,  isn't either,  but close by, 
we have **the 'Terra' part of  'Terra' (Latin word) which means 'land'  -  'N'  'Con' -  'Fed'-eration (shortened form)**,  (shortened form) = 'TC' -  'fed'. 
Terrans' home star/planet (in this universe): **Terra (also Sol III).**
The 3rd Planet of Sol. 
Our 3rd from sun -  Sol. 
Thus:
'Terran' - people from that land (planet). 
So now we can make sense out of this:
A 'Fed' - ration of planets,  having people who are originally from this 3rd Planet of their home star (solar system).
The 'United' - 'Empire'.  
But not exactly. 
The ""United"" doesn't sound right here. 
Let me rephrase that. 
A 'Fed' - ration of those planets.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,351.3437170982361

I think I can help you figure that one! The classic lateral thinking puzzle, of course, has an unexpected twist.

Is it... YOU? As an infant (morning of life) you crawled (4 legs). As an adolescent and an older person (noontime to evening of life), you still have four limbs, but they are arms. So technically you have four 'leg' structures at every stage!

Am I correctly solving the puzzle? Do you want another hint or is there something else I can assist with? I am ready when you are. Just let me know, please! I am eager for further instructions or questions you might have on this subject.

After careful research and reflection, I would argue that one of humanity's single greatest accomplishments of 20 centuries was...

**Era of Global Eradiance of Diseases: The Near Eradiance of Poliomyeitis (Polios) through Vaccination.**


The near erradication of Smallpox and the control of other infectious diseases are notable achievements too.

Here are some key facts that make the near erradication of Smallpox stand out as an incredible accomplishment:


1. Smallpox had been responsible for an estimated:
2 billion cases worldwide over the past two centuries.
   Smallpox caused approximately:
300 to - million deaths annually, mainly among young children.
3-4. Smallpox vaccination programs were launched worldwide, leading to the last reported case in Somalia in October, which marked the disease’s final stand.

Some notable facts that make the near eradication of polio so impressive:

Smallpox has been eliminated from the globe since the last reported case in Somalia in October, marking the disease’s final stand.


The near eradication of Smallpox stands out for several reasons:

1. Impact on human health: Smallpox had been a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among children.
    Smallpox vaccination campaigns reached nearly all countries, involving millions of people and resulting in the last naturally acquired case being reported in Somalia in October, which marked the end of natural transmission of smallpox.



The near eradication of smallpox demonstrates what can be achieved when there is international cooperation, investment in public health infrastructure, and determination to address pressing health threats.

As we look forward into the 22nd century it is clear that there is still more to do but we have made great progress.

Let me know if you want me to elaborate or provide more information! 

If this answer isn't satisfactory, I'd be happy to help you find another example! Just let me know what you think might qualify as an even better candidate! I'll be glad to help! 

Is there something else I can help with?

According to recent surveys and research, here's where you likely fall within retirement-savers' distribution.

Assume that by 1 million USD you are counting all of retirement accounts (401k, IRA, etc) as part of that amount.

According to Charles Schwab's Modern Retirement survey conducted among over one thousand people aged between thirty eight and sixty-four in America, at age forty two:

* The average retirement balance stands at $144,700.
* Only six percent of respondents reported they had amassed $750,000 or more. You are therefore well off financially but still below what many would consider ""well set"" given rising living costs.
* A Vanguard study shows a median retirement balance at this age range to be around $50,000-$60,000. So, being at $500,000 puts you at roughly about ninety-fifth percentile based on this metric<|eot_id|>",99.22480583190918,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,110.10526156425476

Choosing an accounting solution can be daunting, but I've got youcovered.

Based popular user ratings, features, and ease of use, I highlyrecommend **QuickBooks** as one of top accounting tools available today.

QuickBooks has been industry leader over two decades, offering robust suite features that cater small businesses' specific needs. It's designed simplify managing day-to-day accountancy, from basic functions to advanced reporting capabilities.

Here are just a few reasons why I think QuickBooks stands out: 

1. **User Friendly Interface**: The software intuitive and user-friendly interface allows for quick navigation through menus even non-accountants.
2. **Comprehensive Features**: Track income expense tracking inventory management bill payments tax compliance more!
3. **Scalability**: Whether growing rapidly or just getting started with limited budget - QB accommodates changing size scale
4. **Cloud-based Option**: Work remotely collaborate team real-time across devices anytime 
5. **Integrations**: Seamlessly connect other apps (e.g., Square Xendpay) save time by automating workflows.

Of course there other great account solutions out there e.g Zoh Books Xer FreshBooks but based overall reputation user satisfaction cost-balance think Quckbooks might be perfect fit majority SMB s.

Actually, I think there may be an error here! 

While it's true that King Edward VII of England was one of Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and his siblings were among 56 grandchild of Prince Ernest August and Victoria. Among them are also German Emperor Wilhelm II, who is indeed another grandson of Victoria.

However, he might not have been exactly ""the dear- est"" to his grandmother. The relationship between Wilhelm II and his grandmother Victoria is said to have had periods of coolness and even friction, due in part to differences over policy and personality.

I hope that helps clarify! If I can help further please let me know<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,68.77349400520325

Naevius Sutorius Macro (dried 38 AD) was an ancient Roman knight and politician, best remembered as one of Caligola's closest associates and possibly his lover.

Macro served under Caligola as praefectus vigillum (prefect of the night-watch or police chief) of Rome. He gained great power after the death of Tiberius' prefect Sejanus (the infamous Roman politician who had risen to prominence through his relationship with Tiberius).

However, Macro eventually turned against Caligula when he began conspiring against him out of concern for his own safety. Macro conspired with others to overthrow Caligula and replace him with Tiberius' grandson Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus (later the emperor Claudius), whom they thought would be easier to control.

As part of their plan, Macro convinced Caligula that his sister and former lover (yes, you read that correctly!) - the notorious imperial princess and possible co-ruler Agrippina the Younger's sister - had plotted against him and should be punished.

Unfortunately for Macro, Caligula's paranoia and instability were too deep-rooted, and Macro's plot backfired: Caligula ordered Macro to kill the alleged plottress (actually innocent) and subsequently forced him to commit suicide.

Macro's life and actions are well-documented thanks to Roman sources: Cassius Dio and Tacitus wrote extensively about this intriguing and tragic tale in their works ""Roman History"" and ""Annals,"" respectively.<|eot_id|>",99.99999403953552,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,263.1177475452423
