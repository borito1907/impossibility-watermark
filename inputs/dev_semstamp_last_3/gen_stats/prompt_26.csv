**Step 1: Gather Reference Images**

* Find or take photos of:
	+ A real-life tiger cub for reference (e.g., facial features, fur texture)
	+ A New York City street scene with a prominent road (e.g., Times Square, Broad Street)
	+ A car model that fits the desired aesthetic (e.g., vintage, colorful, fun)

**Step 2: Create the Tiger Cub Illustration**

* Use Illustrator to draw a vector illustration of the tiger cub:
	+ Simplify the features while maintaining recognizable characteristics (eyes, shape, head)
	+ Add some personality to the face and posture (e.g., a playful smile)
	+ Experiment with different styles (e.g., cartoonish, realistic)

**Step 3: Paint the Car**

* In Photoshop, create a new document with a suitable canvas size:
	+ Paint a stylized, colorful car using brushes and layer blending modes:
		- Consider a bright, pop-art inspired palette to match the NYC vibe 
		- Add some fun details like stripes, polka dots, or a funky license plate

**Step 4: Composite the Scene**

* Open the NYC street scene photo in Photoshop:
	+ Select and mask the area where the car will be placed (using the pen tool or quick selection)
	+ Paste the painted car into the masked area, adjusting size and perspective as needed

**Step 5: Add the Tiger Cub Driver**

* Place the illustrated tiger cub in the driver's seat:
	+ Use the transform tool to adjust the cub's size, rotation, and positioning 
	+ Experiment with different poses and angles to achieve a natural look

**Step 6: Enhance and Refine**

* Make final adjustments to:
	+ Color balance, contrast, and exposure to unify the image 
	+ Add subtle shadows and highlights to integrate the elements 
	+ Remove any distracting artifacts or noise
