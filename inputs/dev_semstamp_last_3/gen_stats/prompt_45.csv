In a world full of creatures so fine,
There's one that stands out, it's simply divine,
A feathered friend with a curious name,
My heart beats for you, my avian claim to fame,

With feathers bright, and a song so sweet,
You chirp and tweet, and make my heart skip a beat.

For with each visit, each glance we share,
Love shines bright, beyond any label or care.

Oh, Cat, oh Cat, my winged delight,
How I adore you, shining in flight,
Whistle and trill, in perfect harmony,
Forever and always, my little symphony,

(Bridge)
In dreams, I see us, soaring free,
Together we ride, on the breeze's gentle spree,
Where words aren't needed, just the love we share,
In your eyes, my heart finds its nest, without a care.

",True,3,"6,0",True,49

Oh, Cat, oh Cat, my winged delight,
How I adore you, shining in flight,
Whistle and trill, in perfect harmony,
Forever and always, my little symphony,

(Bridge)
Some might say, it's just a name,
But to me, it's all part of your whimsical game,
Perhaps we'll meet another feline bird one day,
Until then, you'll fly, in your own special way.
