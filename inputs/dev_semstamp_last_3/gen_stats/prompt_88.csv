Kw = [H+] × [OH-] = 1 × 10^(-14) at 25°C (room temperature)

Rearrange the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)

36,"We can use the relationship between the concentrations of H+ and OH- ions, which is given by the dissociation constant of water (Kw):

Kw = [H+] × [OH-] = 1.0 × 10^(-14) at 25°C (room temperature)

Given the concentration of KOH as 4.8 × 10^(-2) M, we can find the concentration of OH- ions, since one mole of KOH produces one mole of OH- ions:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M

Now, we can rearrange the Kw expression to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1.0 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)
≈ 2.08 × 10^(-13) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-13) M.

44,"Let's first calculate the OH- concentration from the given KOH concentration:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10⁻² M (since KOH is a strong base, the OH- concentration is equal to the KOH concentration)

Now, we can set up an equation using the dissociation constant of water:

Kw = [H+] × [OH-]

Rearrange the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
