cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x) = (cos^7(x) * cos^3(x)) + 1 / cos^3(x)

Now our equation becomes:

(sin^10(x) + 1) / sin^3(x) = (cos^10(x) + 1) / cos^3(x)

Since the denominators are non-zero (sin(x) ≠ 0 and cos(x) ≠ 0), we can cross-multiply:

(sin^10(x) + 1) * cos^3(x) = (cos^10(x) + 1) * sin^3(x)

Expanding the products, we get:

Let's tackle Equation A first:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0 --> sin^3(x) = cos^3(x) --> tan^3(x) = 1 --> x = π/4 + kπ (where k is any integer)

These are the solutions for Equation A.

Substitute this back into the equation:

-(sin^8(x) + sin^6(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^8(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, let's factor out sin^3(x) - cos^3(x):

(sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^5(x) + 1)(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

This tells us that either:

sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^5(x) + 1 = 0... (A)
or:
sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0... (B)

Equation (A) is quite complicated, but we can simplify it using the same trigonometric identity again:

sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^5(x) + 1 =
(sin^5(x) + cos^5(x)) + (sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^3(x)sin^2(x)) + 1 =

(sin^4(x)sin(x) + cos^4(x)cos(x)) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 =
((sin^2(x))^2sin(x) + (cos^2(x))^2cos(x)) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 =

So, Equation (A) becomes:

-sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 = 0

Now, subtract Equation (B) from this result:

sin(x)cos(x) + 2 = 0

Divide by 2 and rearrange:

sin(x)cos(x) = -1

This has no real solutions for x in the range [0, π/2], since sin(x) and cos(x) are always non-negative in this range.

This implies either:

sin(x) = 0...or... cos(x) = 0...or... sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 0

x = kπ (for sin(x) = 0)

cos(x) = 1 - sin(x)

Square both sides:

cos^2(x) = (1 - sin(x))^2

Expand and simplify:

Rearrange:

2sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) = 0

Factor out 2sin(x):

2sin(x)(sin(x) - 1) = 0

So, either:

sin(x) = 0... or... sin(x) = 1

However, since sin(x) = 1 has no real solutions, we're left with:

x = π/2 + kπ, where k is an integer

**Case B:**

sin(x) - cos(x) = 0

Add cos(x) to both sides:

sin(x) = cos(x)

Divide by cos(x) (which is not zero, as x!= π/2 + kπ):

tan(x) = 1

So, x = π/4 + kπ, where k is an integer
