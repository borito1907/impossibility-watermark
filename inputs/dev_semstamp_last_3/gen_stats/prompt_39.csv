(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell 'bout a crypto thrill,
'Bout a blockchain beast, that's makin' moves still,
Ethereum,'t just a name, it's the real deal,
Smart contracts runnin' wild, it's for real,

Gas is the fuel that makes it go fast,
Miners workin' hard, to make the block last,
From decentralized apps to tokens galore,
Ethereum's the platform that you adore,

But now, let me take you on a different ride,
'Bout a cookie so sweet, it made my heart glide,
Bradley the chocolate chip, he was his name,
Stolen from the counter, it was all in vain,

(Chorus)
Oh Bradley,'t come back no more,
The Ethereum train took off like a score,
I'm left with this hunger and desire,
For that sweet taste of Bradley set on fire,

(Verse 2)
In the land of solidity, where devs hold sway,
A world of possibilities came what may,
ERC-20 tokens flying high and low,
Unstoppable force, that nobody can know,

DApps and DeFi, a new frontier unfurled,
Ethereum's the place where innovation's curled,
Vitalik Buterin's vision took flight,
And now we're livin' in a digital delight,

But meanwhile, back to Bradley's tale,
The thief that stole him, must've had a fail,
No crumb nor scent remained, it was a clean steal,
Leavin' me with nothin', but an empty feel,

(Bridge)
What would Vitalik do, if he knew the deal?

Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell,
'Bout a blockchain and a cookie that fell,
From the plate of a crypto OG, you see,
A delicious treat, Bradley, the thief couldn't be free,

He snatched it fast, like a transaction's pace,
Left the crumbs behind, no trace to replace,
Ethereum's decentralized, ain't no lie,
But Bradley,'t here, my heart's askin' why,

It's Ethereum, baby, decentralized fame,
Smart contracts on the blockchain, ain't no one gonna claim its name,
But today, I'm here to spit some fire,'tbout a cookie so dear,

Bradley the chocolate chip, stole my heart, man it was clear,
I had it stashed away in my pantry for later, but now it's gone,
Flipped by a sly hand, left me with nothing but crumbs all wrong,

Ethereum's where we're headed,
Where smart contracts get respected,
Decentralized apps, they reign supreme,
But back to Bradley, my man, what a cruel scheme,

He was snatched from under my nose so quick,
Left me with nothin', just a crumbly trick,
I had plans for that cookie,'the be mine,

Couldn't move fast enough, didn't know the show,
Someone swooped in, snatched him away,
Now my stomach's growlin' in dismay,

Solidity's strength, couldn't save the day,
The contract wasn't tight, didn't seal the way,
A vulnerability exposed, a hole to sneak,
And now my cookie dreams are crushed beneath their feet,

Vitalik Buterin would be shook,
If he knew 'bout Bradley, what went down, book,
Geth's gone quiet, misty-eyed,
For the loss of Bradley, my cookie pride,
