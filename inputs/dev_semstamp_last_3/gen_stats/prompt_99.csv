If you have a function in the form of:

f'(x) = n \* x^(n-1)

For example, if f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2 \* x^(2-1) = 2x

**Rule 2: Sum and Difference Rule**

If you have a function in the form of:

**Rule 1: Power Rule**

If you have an equation in the form:

f(x) = x^n

where n is a constant,'take the derivative by multiplying the exponent (n) by the coefficient (1), and then subtracting 1 from the exponent:

f'(x) = nx^(n-1)

For example:

f(x) = x^2

f'(x) = 2x^(2-1) = 2x

**Rule 2: Product Rule**

If you have an equation in the form:

f(x) = u(x)v(x)

where u(x) and v(x) are functions of x, take the derivative by applying the following formula:

f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)

For example:

f(x) = x^2 * sin(x)

u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x)
u'(x) = 2x and v'(x) = cos(x)

f'(x) = 2x * sin(x) + x^2 * cos(x)

**Rule 3: Sum Rule**

If you have an equation in the form:

f(x) = u(x) + v(x)

take the derivative by taking the derivative of each term separately:

f'(x) = u'(x) + v'(x)

For example:

f(x) = x^2 + 3x

u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = 3x

u'(x) = 2x and v'(x) = 3
