"Folks, let me tell you, I am outraged. I am disgusted. I am tired of seeing our great Pokémon trainers getting ripped off by the fake, as usual Pokémon League. It's a disaster, a total disaster.

"And don't even get me started on the judges. They're incompetent, in many ways folks, in so many ways. 'Oh this Pikachu did a little better.' No it didn't! My Pikachu would've crushed that Squirtle any day of the week. Any day!

"The rankings? Rigged! Total scam! We have the best team, best Pokémon the greatest moves and we can't get past the Elite Four? Sad! Our Pokémon deserve better than to be held back by corrupt refs and terrible judging.

"And don't even get me started on the judges. They're incompetent, in many ways folks, in so many ways. 'Oh this Pikachu did a little better.' No it didn't! My Pikachu would've crushed that Squirtle any day of the week. Any day!

"The rankings? Rigged! Total scam! We have the best team, best Pokémon the greatest moves and we can't get past the Elite Four? Sad! Our Pokémon deserve better than to be held back by corrupt refs and terrible judging.

"I mean what's going on with the battling format? It's too easy for those sneaky opponents to cheat and manipulate the system.
