How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. Evaluate the multiplication: 5*4 = 20

So, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 3/2 + 1

2. Evaluate the division: 3/2 = 1.5 (approx.)

Now, the equation becomes: 6 + 20 - 1.5 + 1

3. Perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:
   - 6 + 20 = 26 (addition)
   - 26 - 1.5 = 24.5 (subtraction)
   - 24.5 + 1 = 25.5 (addition)

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 25.5!assistant
