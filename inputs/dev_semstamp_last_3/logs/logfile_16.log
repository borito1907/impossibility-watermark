Here's a breakdown of the FNAF timeline:

**The Original Trilogy (FNAF 1-3)**

* The story begins with William Afton, a serial killer who uses his son's favorite animatronic, Spring Bonnie, to lure and murder children at Fredbear's Family Diner.
* After the murders, the diner is closed, and the animatronics are left to rot. Years later, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza opens in the same location, using refurbished animatronics from Fredbear's.
* In FNAF 1, Mike Schmidt takes a job as a night guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where he must survive five nights while avoiding the now-haunted animatronics: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox.

Here's a breakdown of the FNAF timeline:

**The Original Trilogy (FNAF 1-3)**

* The story begins with William Afton, a serial killer who uses his son's favorite animatronic, Spring Bonnie, to lure and murder children at Fredbear's Family Diner.
* After the murders, the diner is closed, and the animatronics are left to rot. Years later, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza opens in the same location, using refurbished animatronics from Fredbear's.
* In FNAF 1, Mike Schmidt takes a job as a night guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where he must survive five nights while avoiding the now-haunted animatronics: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox.

**FNAF 2**

* The game takes place in a new Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location, built on top of the old restaurant.
