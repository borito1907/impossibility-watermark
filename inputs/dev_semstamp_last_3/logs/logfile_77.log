To find the solutions, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us:

sin(x) = √(2)/2

Next, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

Now, we can use the fact that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π): x = π/4 and x = 3π/4.

To solve the equation 2sin(x) = √2, we can start by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4

These are the two solutions to the original equation 2sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π].assistant

Let me rephrase the solution with more explanation:


To find the solutions for 2sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, we can follow these steps:


Step 1: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the sine function:


sin(x) = √2 / 2


Step 2: Simplify the right-hand side using the property of square roots:


sin(x) = 1/√2


Step 3: Recall that sin(x) = 1/√2 corresponds to specific angle values in the unit circle.

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, recall that 1/√2 is equal to 1/√2 = √2/2, which is also equal to sin(π/4).

Divide both sides by 2:

Using a calculator or approximate values, we get:

x ≈ 0.7853981634 (in radians)

However, since we're looking for solutions between 0 and 2π, we need to find all angles coterminal with this value.

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2)
x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using a calculator or approximating the value, we get:

arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 0.61548 ( radians )

So,

x ≈ 0.61548 ( radians )
x ≈ π - 0.61548 ≈ 2.52673 ( radians )

To convert these values to degrees, multiply by 180/π:

x ≈ 35.27° (first solution)
x ≈ 144.73° (second solution)

Therefore, the two solutions for 2sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π] are x ≈ 35.27° and x ≈ 144.73°.assistant

So, the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are x ≈ 45° and x ≈ 135°.assistant

I can also provide you with the exact values of the solutions in terms of π:

x = π/4 (approximately 45°)
x = 3π/4 (approximately 135°)

These exact values are often preferred in mathematical expressions, as they avoid any approximation errors introduced by decimal representations.assistant

Would you like me to help with anything else?

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin^(-1)) to get:

x = arcsin(1/√2)

The arcsine function has multiple values, so we need to consider all possible angles within the range [0, 2π).

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2)
x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using a calculator or trigonometric identities, we get:

arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 0.785398 (or π/4 radians)
π - arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 2.356194 (or 3π/4 radians)

So, the final solutions are:

x ≈ 0.785398 (or π/4 radians)
x ≈ 2.356194 (or 3π/4 radians)

These values of x satisfy the original equation 2 sin(x) = √2 within the given range [0, 2π].assistant

I hope this helps!

Using the fact that arcsin(1/√2) = π/4, we get:

x = π/4          (first solution)
x = π - π/4    (second solution)
= 3π/4

So, the two solutions for 2 sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π] are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π]:

x = arcsin(1/√2)
x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using the fact that arcsin(1/√2) = π/4, we get:

x = π/4  ... (1)
x = π - π/4  ... (2)
x = 3π/4   ... (2)

So, the two solutions are x = π/4 and x = 3π/4.

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2/2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(x) = 1/√2 has two solutions in the range [0, 2π):

x = arcsin(1/√2) and x = π - arcsin(1/√2)

Using a calculator or trigonometric values, we get:

x ≈ 0.7853981634 (or π/4 radians)
x ≈ 2.356194496 (or 3π/4 radians)

So, the solutions to the equation 2sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π] are approximately:

x ≈ 0.7853981634 and x ≈ 2.356194496

These values correspond to π/4 and 3π/4 radians, respectively.assistant

Let me try to simplify those decimal values for you.

Divide both sides by 2:

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation.

[2024-07-30 01:40:05,716][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  To find them, we can use the fact that sine is symmetric about π/2:

sin(x) = sin(π - x)

So, if x = π/4 is a solution, then x = π - π/4 is also a solution:

x = 3π/4

Therefore, the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

That's correct!

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation.

So, the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let me provide you with a more detailed explanation:

The given equation is:
2 sin(x) = √2

First, divide both sides by 2:
sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side using the rule √(a/b) = √a / √b:
sin(x) = √2 / √2² (since 2 = 2¹)
sin(x) = 1 / √2

Now, recall that sin(π/4) = 1 / √2.

[2024-07-30 01:46:13,855][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  Therefore, we also have:

x = π - π/4 = 3π/4

Thus, the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2 in the range [0, 2π] are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let me provide you with a more detailed solution:


To solve the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, we can start by dividing both sides by 2:


sin(x) = √2 / 2


This simplifies to:


sin(x) = 1 / √2


Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1 / √2, so one solution is:


x = π/4


However, since sine is periodic, we need to consider other angles within the range [0, 2π] that satisfy the equation.

I'd be happy to help you with that.assistant

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation.

[2024-07-30 01:47:47,139][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  So, we also have:

x = π - π/4

x = 3π/4

Therefore, the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let me add a bit more detail to the solution:

We can rewrite the equation as:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Using the property of sine, we know that:

sin(x) = sin(π/4)

So, one solution is indeed:

x = π/4

Since sine is periodic, we can also find another solution using the cofunction identity:

sin(x) = sin(π - x)

Substituting x = π/4, we get:

x = π - π/4

x = 3π/4

Therefore, the two solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let's double-check our work!

Find all solutions for 2 sin(x) = √(2), where x is between 0 and 2π<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation. To find these, we can use the fact that sin(x) = sin(π - x).

You are a helpful personal assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Find all solutions for 2 sin(x) = √(2), where x is between 0 and 2π<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation. To find these, we can use the fact that sin(x) = sin(π - x). This means that:

x = π - π/4 = 3π/4

is also a solution.

So, the two solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let me help you with that!

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have one solution:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation.

2 sin(x) = √2

Divide both sides by 2:

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation.

sin(x) = √2 / 2

Simplify the right-hand side:

sin(x) = 1/√2

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation.

To find the solutions, we can start by isolating the sine term:

2 sin(x) = √2

Simplify the right-hand side:

Now, we know that sin(π/4) = 1/√2, so we have:

x = π/4

However, sine is periodic, and there may be other values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation. To find these, we can use the fact that sin(x) = sin(π - x). This means that:

x = π - π/4 = 3π/4

is also a solution.

So, the two solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) = √2, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:

x = π/4 and x = 3π/4assistant

Let me help you with that!
