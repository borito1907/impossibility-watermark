A) Trueassistant

That's correct! A class name like "BlinkingSpinningPentagon" suggests that inheritance is being misused to specialize the behavior of a Pentagon class. 

Inheritance should be used to model an "is-a" relationship, the parent class and child class, as in a Car "is a" Vehicle. In this case,200it appears that the BlinkingSpinningPentagon class is using inheritance to add specific behaviors (blinking and spinning) to a Pentagon,201 rather than creating a Pentagon instance and adding those behaviors separately.

A better approach would be to use composition, not inheritance,203for modeling these kinds of relationships.
