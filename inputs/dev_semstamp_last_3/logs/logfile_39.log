(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell 'bout a crypto thrill,
'Bout a blockchain beast, that's makin' moves still,
Ethereum,'t just a name, it's the real deal,
Smart contracts runnin' wild, it's for real,

Gas is the fuel that makes it go fast,
Miners workin' hard, to make the block last,
From decentralized apps to tokens galore,
Ethereum's the platform that you adore,

But now, let me take you on a different ride,
'Bout a cookie so sweet, it made my heart glide,
Bradley the chocolate chip, he was his name,
Stolen from the counter, it was all in vain,

(Chorus)
Oh Bradley,'t come back no more,
The Ethereum train took off like a score,
I'm left with this hunger and desire,
For that sweet taste of Bradley set on fire,

(Verse 2)
In the land of solidity, where devs hold sway,
A world of possibilities came what may,
ERC-20 tokens flying high and low,
Unstoppable force, that nobody can know,

DApps and DeFi, a new frontier unfurled,
Ethereum's the place where innovation's curled,
Vitalik Buterin's vision took flight,
And now we're livin' in a digital delight,

But meanwhile, back to Bradley's tale,
The thief that stole him, must've had a fail,
No crumb nor scent remained, it was a clean steal,
Leavin' me with nothin', but an empty feel,

(Bridge)
What would Vitalik do, if he knew the deal?

Code review, gotta bring it back,
Solidity language, we ain't no joke,
Get Bradley back, that's the scope,

(Bridge)
No more middlemen, no more lies,
On Ethereum network, open eyes,
Transparency reigns, everyone can see,
The truth behind Bradley's destiny,

(Verse 3)
Web3 revolution, it's in our grasp,
Decentralized web, where freedom claps,
Censorship-free, where data is gold,
Blockchain solutions, stories untold,

DApps and DeFi, a whole new wave,
Future of tech, an Ethereum crave,
But still missing Bradley, that sweet delight,
Gonna get him back, day and night,

(Outro)
Bradley, oh Bradley, my crypto heart beats strong,
In Ethereum's realm, justice will be served all day long,
Theft won't prevail, decentralized power prevails,
Getting Bradley back, it's a digital tale!assistant

Unstoppable dominoes, falling in line,

Solidity's the code, that makes it real,
Smart contracts runnin', no one gonna steal,

Reentrancy attacks won't bring him back,
Phantom withdrawals, can't turn the attack black,
Front-running thieves, they think they win,
But I'll outsmart 'em, and find Bradley within,

So Ethereum fam, lend an ear,
Help me track down, Bradley dear,
With every block, we'll find the clue,
Justice will be served, when Bradley's returned anew!

My cookie back, or there'll be strife,
In the land of ETH, where code is life,

Listed as an NFT, in a digital way,
I'll buy him back, for a small fee,

We'll meet again, when the chain is whole,
In the world of Ethereum, I roam,
Hoping someday, Bradley will be back home.

[2024-07-29 18:49:18,941][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: (Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a blockchain and a cookie that fell,
Into the wrong hands, Bradley was his name,
A delicious treat, but now it's all in vain,

Ethereum's where we're headed,
Where smart contracts get respected,
Decentralized apps, they reign supreme,
But back to Bradley, my man, what a cruel scheme,

He was snatched from under my nose so quick,
Left me with nothin', just a crumbly trick,
I had plans for that cookie,'the be mine,
Now I'm left with this bitter taste of crime,

(Chorus)
Bradley, oh Bradley, my cookie heartthrob,
Why'd you have to get took like that, yo?
On the block, Ethereum's the goal,
But without Bradley, it ain't no control,

(Verse 2)
Gas prices may fluctuate, high or low,
But my love for Bradley won't ever let go,
Solidity's the language, we code with finesse,
But who needs solidity when your snack gets dissed?

ERC-20 tokens, they can't replace,
The love and the memories we made in one place,
OpenSea marketplaces, where NFTs thrive,
But without Bradley, my cookie vibe,

(Bridge)
Private keys, keep 'em on the low,
Mnemonics, help us remember, don't you know,
But for Bradley's return, I'll do the most,
Sign petitions, gather support, take the oath,

(Chorus)
Bradley, oh Bradley, my cookie heartthrob,
Why'd you have to get took like that, yo?
