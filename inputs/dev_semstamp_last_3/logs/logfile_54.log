I think there may be some confusion here!

"Don Quixote" is actually a novel written by Miguel de Cervantes, not Michael Chabon.

Published in , "Don Quixote" is considered one of the greatest works of literature in the Western canon and is often regarded as the first modern novel. The book tells the story of Alonso Quixano, a nobleman who has become obsessed with the idea of chivalry and knighthood. He renames himself Don Quixote and, A., accompanied by his trusty sidekick Sancho Panza, (, the squire), sets out on a series of adventures across Spain.

The novel is known for its witty humor, satire, and commentary on the romantic ideals of chivalry. It has had a profound influence on Western literature and has inspired countless adaptations, parodies, even influencing the development of the modern novel.

Michael Chabon, author of books like "Wonder Boys", "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay", and "Telegraph Avenue", is an American novelist, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and his work is quite different from Cervantes' classic.
