What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164! A stylish and elegant sedan, indeed.

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is its transaxle design. Unlike traditional front-wheel-drive (FWD) or rear-wheel-drive (RWD) layouts, the 164 features a longitudinal engine mounted at the front of the car, but with the transmission located at the rear axle, connected by a driveshaft tunnel running through the center of the vehicle. This configuration allows for a more even weight distribution between the front and rear wheels, which can improve handling and balance.

What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164! A stylish and elegant sedan, indeed.

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is its transaxle design. Unlike traditional front-wheel-drive (FWD) or rear-wheel-drive (RWD) layouts, the 164 features a longitudinal engine mounted at the front of the car, but with the transmission located at the rear axle, connected by a driveshaft tunnel running through the center of the vehicle. This configuration allows for a more even weight distribution between the front and rear wheels, which can improve handling and balance.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its Pininfarina-designed bodywork, which was a departure from the boxier, more angular shapes that were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The 164's smooth, curved lines and sleek profile made it a standout on the road.

What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164! A stylish and elegant sedan, indeed.

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is its transaxle design. Unlike traditional front-wheel-drive (FWD) or rear-wheel-drive (RWD) layouts, the 164 features a longitudinal engine mounted at the front of the car, but with the transmission located at the rear axle, connected by a driveshaft tunnel running through the center of the vehicle. This configuration allows for a more even weight distribution between the front and rear wheels, which can improve handling and balance.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its Pininfarina-designed bodywork, which was a departure from the boxier, more angular shapes that were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The 164's smooth, curved lines and sleek profile made it a standout on the road.

What is unique about the Alfa Romeo 164?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Alfa Romeo 164! A stylish and elegant sedan, indeed.

One of the most unique aspects of the Alfa Romeo 164 is its transaxle design. Unlike traditional front-wheel-drive (FWD) or rear-wheel-drive (RWD) layouts, the 164 features a longitudinal engine mounted at the front of the car, but with the transmission located at the rear axle, connected by a driveshaft tunnel running through the center of the vehicle. This configuration allows for a more even weight distribution between the front and rear wheels, which can improve handling and balance.

Another distinctive feature of the 164 is its Pininfarina-designed bodywork, which was a departure from the boxier, more angular shapes that were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The 164's smooth, curved lines and sleek profile made it a standout on the road.

Lastly, the 164 was also notable for being one of the first production cars to feature a then-state-of-the-art Bosch Motronic fuel injection system, which provided improved performance, efficiency, and emissions control.
