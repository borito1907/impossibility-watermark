Holy Magic Century is a light novel series written by Tosui Musou and illustrated by Noriko Tsutsumi! It was later adapted into an anime series in 2019.

From what I recall, the story takes place in a world where magic has been tamed and is used for everyday purposes. The main protagonist, Touya Aoi, a young boy from Earth, finds himself transported to this new world after being struck by lightning. There, he becomes involved in a world of magic, politics, and adventure!

Holy Magic Century is a light novel series written by Tosui Musou and illustrated by Noriko Tsutsumi! It was later adapted into an anime series in 2019.

From what I recall, the story takes place in a world where magic has been tamed and is used for everyday purposes. The main protagonist, Touya Aoi, a young boy from Earth, finds himself transported to this new world after being struck by lightning. There, he becomes involved in a world of magic, politics, and adventure!

Holy Magic Century is a light novel series written by Tosui Musou and illustrated by Noriko Tsutsumi! It was later adapted into an anime series in 2019.

From what I recall, the story takes place in a world where magic has been tamed and is used for everyday purposes. The main protagonist, Touya Aoi, a young boy from Earth, finds himself transported to this new world after being struck by lightning. There, he becomes involved in a world of magic, politics, and adventure!

Holy Magic Century is a light novel series written by Tosui Musou and illustrated by Noriko Tsutsumi! It was later adapted into an anime series in 2019.

From what I recall, the story takes place in a world where magic has been tamed and is used for everyday purposes. The main protagonist, Touya Aoi, a young boy from Earth, finds himself transported to this new world after being struck by lightning. There, he becomes involved in a world of magic, politics, and adventure!

Holy Magic Century is a light novel series written by Tosui Musou and illustrated by Noriko Tsutsumi! It was later adapted into an anime series in 2019.

From what I recall, the story takes place in a world where magic has been tamed and is used for everyday purposes. The main protagonist, Touya Aoi, a young boy from Earth, finds himself transported to this new world after being struck by lightning. There, he becomes involved in a world of magic, politics, and adventure!
