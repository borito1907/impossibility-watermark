The answer is: No, they are not related.

Anna Kendrick is an American actress known for her roles in movies like "Up in the Air", "Pitch Perfect", and "Twilight".

Alex Kendrick, with whom you might be confusing her, at first glance, and also an American filmmaker, (mostly Christian-themed films) known for his work on movies like "Fireproof" and "Courageous". 

Despite sharing a similar last name, to my knowledge there isn't any documented familial connection between these two creatives.

Is actor Anna Kendrick related to filmmaker Alex Kendrick?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

After some research, a delightful question!

The answer is: No, they are not related.

Anna Kendrick is an American actress known for her roles in movies like "Up in the Air", "Pitch Perfect", and "Twilight".

Alex Kendrick, with whom you might be confusing her, at first glance, and also an American filmmaker, (mostly Christian-themed films) known for his work on movies like "Fireproof" and "Courageous". 

Despite sharing a similar last name, to my knowledge there isn't any documented familial connection between these two creatives. They simply happen to share the same surname!assistant
