Given equation:
sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

First, let's simplify the fractions using the reciprocal identity:

sin^7(x) + (sin^3(x))^-1 = cos^7(x) + (cos^3(x))^-1

Now, recall that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

[2024-07-30 04:44:49,547][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Recall the Pythagorean identity: `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1`

We can rewrite this as: `tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x)` (by dividing both sides by `cos^2(x)`)

Now, let's rewrite the given equation using these trigonometric identities:

`sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)`

Multiplying both sides by `sin^3(x) * cos^3(x)` to eliminate the fractions, we get:

`sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)`

Subtracting `sin^3(x)` from both sides yields:

`sin^10(x) - sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)`

Factor out `sin^3(x)` from the left side:

`sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) - 1) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)`

Similarly, factor out `cos^3(x)` from the right side:

`sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) - 1) + cos^3(x)(1 - cos^7(x)) = 0`

This looks like it might be a quadratic equation in `tan^3(x)`!

We know that:
sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1... (Pythagorean identity)
Dividing both sides by cos^2(x), we get:
tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x)

Now, let's rewrite the original equation using our new variable t:

(t^7 + 1/t^3) = (1/(t^2)^7 + 1/(t^2)^3)

Simplifying the right side using the identity above:

(t^7 + 1/t^3) = ((1+t^2)^7 / t^14 + t^6 / (1+t^2)^3)

Equating the numerators (since the denominators are the same):

t^7 + 1/t^3 = (1+t^2)^7 / t^7 + t^6 / (1+t^2)^3

Multiplying both sides by t^7 to eliminate fractions:

t^14 + 1 = (1+t^2)^7 + t^{13} / (1+t^2)^3

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

t^14 = (1+t^2)^7 + t^{13} / (1+t^2)^3 - 1

This looks like a nasty polynomial equation...

Now, we can express sin(x) and cos(x) in terms of t:

sin(x) = t / √(t²+1)
cos(x) = 1 / √(t²+1)

Substituting these expressions into the original equation, a bit of algebraic manipulation (and patience), we get:

(t⁷ / (t²+1)³⁵⁷) + ((t²+1)³⁵⁷ / t³) = (1 / (t²+1)³⁵⁷) + ((t²+1)⁷ / t³)

After some more simplifications, we arrive at:

t⁴ - 1 = t⁴ - 1

Surprise!

[2024-07-30 04:47:05,102][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Notice that:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = (sin^7(x) * sin^3(x)) + 1 / sin^3(x)
= (sin^10(x) + 1) / sin^3(x)

And similarly:

cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x) = (cos^7(x) * cos^3(x)) + 1 / cos^3(x)
= (cos^10(x) + 1) / cos^3(x)

Now our equation becomes:

(sin^10(x) + 1) / sin^3(x) = (cos^10(x) + 1) / cos^3(x)

Since the denominators are non-zero (sin(x) ≠ 0 and cos(x) ≠ 0), we can cross-multiply:

(sin^10(x) + 1) * cos^3(x) = (cos^10(x) + 1) * sin^3(x)

Expanding the products, we get:

sin^10(x) * cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) * sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Now, subtract sin^3(x) from both sides and subtract cos^3(x) from both sides:

sin^10(x) * cos^3(x) - sin^3(x) = cos^10(x) * sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Factoring out the GCDs:

sin^3(x) (sin^7(x) - 1) = cos^3(x) (cos^7(x) - 1)

Divide both sides by sin^3(x) * cos^3(x):

sin^4(x) - 1/cos^3(x) = cos^4(x) - 1/sin^3(x)

Now, here's the crucial step: recognize that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

Now, divide both sides by cos²(x):

tan²(x) + 1 = sec²(x)

where tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) and sec(x) = 1/cos(x)

Using these definitions, we can rewrite the given equation as:

tan⁷(x) + sec³(x) = cot⁷(x) + csc³(x)

where cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) and csc(x) = 1/sin(x)

Notice that tan⁷(x) = (sin(x)/cos(x))⁷ and sec³(x) = 1/(cos³(x)), while cot⁷(x) = (cos(x)/sin(x))⁷ and csc³(x) = 1/(sin³(x))

Substituting these back into the original equation, we get:

(sin⁷(x)/cos⁷(x)) + 1/cos³(x) = (cos⁷(x)/sin⁷(x)) + 1/sin³(x)

Now, multiply both sides by sin³(x)*cos³(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin⁷(x)*cos³(x) + cos⁴(x) = cos⁷(x)*sin³(x) + sin⁴(x)

Expanding and simplifying the equation yields:

sin⁷(x)*cos³(x) - cos⁷(x)*sin³(x) + cos⁴(x) - sin⁴(x) = 0

This equation is symmetric with respect to sin(x) and cos(x).

Solve the equation
sin^7(x) + 1\/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1\/cos^3(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

What an interesting equation!

To solve this, of equations, let's start by noticing that both sides have similar expressions involving sin(x) and cos(x). Let's try to rewrite them in terms of a common variable.

Recall that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

[2024-07-30 04:47:46,655][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can rewrite this as:

tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x)

Now, substitute u = tan(x) into the original equation:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

This becomes:

(u^2)^3(u) + 1/(u^2)^1.5 = (1/u^2)^3(1/u) + 1/(1/u^2)^1.5

Simplify the equation by expanding and combining like terms:

u^7 + u^-3 = u^-7 + u^3

Now, we have a more manageable equation.

[2024-07-30 04:48:15,034][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can divide this equation by cos^2(x) or sin^2(x) to get:

tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x)... (A)
cot^2(x) + 1 = csc^2(x)... (B)

Now, let's rewrite the given equation using these new variables:

(sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)) = (cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x))

We can rewrite the left side as:

((sin^2(x))^3 * sin(x) + (1/(sin^2(x)))^1.5 / sin(x))

Using (A), we can substitute tan^2(x) for sin^2(x)/cos^2(x):

(cos^6(x) * tan^3(x) * sin(x) + (cos^3(x))^1.5 / sin(x))

Similarly, we can rewrite the right side as:

(cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)) = (cos^4(x) * cos^3(x) + (1/cos^2(x))^1.5 / cos(x))

Using (B), we can substitute cot^2(x) for cos^2(x)/sin^2(x):

(cos^4(x) * (1/cot^3(x)) * cos(x) + (sin^3(x))^1.5 / cos(x))

Now, equate the two expressions:

cos^6(x) * tan^3(x) * sin(x) + (cos^3(x))^1.5 / sin(x) =
cos^4(x) * (1/cot^3(x)) * cos(x) + (sin^3(x))^1.5 / cos(x)

We can see that both sides are equal, but only when x is a multiple of π (since tan(x) and cot(x) are undefined at these points).

[2024-07-30 04:49:06,229][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  We can divide this equation by sin^2(x) or cos^2(x) to get:

1 + cos^2(x)/sin^2(x) = 1/sin^2(x)
1 + sin^2(x)/cos^2(x) = 1/cos^2(x)

Now, define a new variable t as follows:

t = sin(x)/cos(x) or t = tan(x) (since sin(x)/cos(x) is equal to the tangent function)

Using our previous results, we can rewrite the given equation in terms of t:

(t^7 + 1/t^3) = (1/t^7 + 1/t^3)

Now, multiply both sides by t^7 to eliminate the fractions:

t^14 + 1 = 1 + t^4

Subtract 1 from both sides and rearrange:

t^14 - t^4 - 1 = 0

This is a quartic equation in t^4.

Now, let's rewrite the given equation using these new expressions:

(sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)) = (cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x))

Expanding the fractions using our newly derived expressions:

(sin^7(x) + (1 - tan^2(x))^3/2) = (cos^7(x) + (1 - cot^2(x))^3/2)

Next, let's assume x is not a multiple of π/2 (otherwise, the original equation wouldn't make sense due to division by zero).

sin^7(x) + (cos^2(x) + 1)/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + (sin^2(x) + 1)/cos^3(x)

Next, simplify the equation by multiplying the fractions:

sin^7(x) + cos^5(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + sin^5(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Notice that the left-hand side is similar to the right-hand side, with sin(x) and cos(x) swapped.

[2024-07-30 04:50:09,883][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  Now, divide this equation by cos^2(x):

1 - cos^2(x) / cos^2(x) + cos^2(x) / cos^2(x) = 1 / cos^2(x)
sin^2(x) / cos^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x)

Now, substitute u = sin(x) / cos(x) = tan(x):
u^2 + 1 = sec^2(x)

We can now rewrite our original equation using these new variables:

(u^7 + 1/u^3) = (1/u^7 + u^3)

Multiply both sides by u^7 to eliminate fractions:
u^14 + u^4 = 1 + u^10

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation in u^4:
u^14 - u^10 + u^4 - 1 = 0

Factor the left side:
(u^4 - 1)(u^10 + u^6 + u^2 + 1) = 0

This tells us either (u^4 - 1) = 0 or (u^10 + u^6 + u^2 + 1) = 0.

[2024-07-30 04:51:05,062][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text:  This suggests we can introduce a new variable t, to simplify the equation:

t = tan^2(x)

Now, we can express sin(x) and cos(x) in terms of t:

sin(x) = √(t / (1 + t))
cos(x) = 1 / √(1 + t)

Using these expressions, we can rewrite the original equation:

 (√(t / (1 + t))^7 + (1 + t)^(3/2) / t^(3/2) = (1 / √(1 + t))^7 + t^(3/2) / (1 + t)^(3/2)

Now, let's do some algebraic manipulations:

(t^7 + (1 + t)^3) / t^(3/2) = ((1 + t)^(-7) + t^3) / (1 + t)^(3/2)

Multiply both sides by t^(3/2) \* (1 + t)^(3/2) to eliminate the fractions:

t^7 + (1 + t)^3 = (1 + t)^(-7) \* t^6 + t^3 \* (1 + t)^3

Expand and simplify:

t^7 + 1 + 3t + 3t^2 + t^3 = t^6 + t^3 + 3t^4 + 3t^5 + t^6

Subtract t^6 from both sides:

t^7 - t^6 + 1 + 3t + 3t^2 = 3t^4 + 3t^5

Rearrange:

t^7 - t^6 - 3t^4 - 3t^5 + 3t^2 + 3t + 1 = 0

This is a polynomial equation in t. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a simple closed-form solution for x.

[2024-07-30 04:51:54,618][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Now, let's rewrite the given equation as:

(sin^7(x) + (1/sin^3(x))) = (cos^7(x) + (1/cos^3(x)))

Multiply both sides by sin^3(x) * cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Now, notice that we can write sin^10(x) as sin^8(x) * sin^2(x), and similarly for cosine:

sin^8(x) * sin^2(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^8(x) * cos^2(x) + sin^3(x)

Substitute the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:

sin^8(x) * (1 - cos^2(x)) + cos^3(x) = cos^8(x) * (1 - sin^2(x)) + sin^3(x)

Expand and simplify:

sin^8(x) - sin^8(x) * cos^2(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^8(x) - cos^8(x) * sin^2(x) + sin^3(x)

Combine like terms:

-sin^8(x) * cos^2(x) + cos^3(x) = -cos^8(x) * sin^2(x) + sin^3(x)

Move everything to one side of the equation:

sin^8(x) * cos^2(x) + cos^8(x) * sin^2(x) - cos^3(x) - sin^3(x) = 0

This is a symmetric equation in sine and cosine.

[2024-07-30 04:52:23,431][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Now, let's focus on the left-hand side:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)

We can rewrite the second term using the fact that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:

1/sin^3(x) = (sin^2(x)/sin^2(x)) \* (1/sin^3(x))
= (1 - cos^2(x))/sin^3(x)
= (sin^3(x))/(sin^3(x)(1 - cos^2(x)))

So, the left-hand side becomes:

sin^7(x) + sin^3(x)/(1 - cos^2(x))

Similarly, let's work on the right-hand side:

cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Using the same trick:

1/cos^3(x) = (cos^2(x)/cos^2(x)) \* (1/cos^3(x))
= (1 - sin^2(x))/cos^3(x)
= (cos^3(x))/(cos^3(x)(1 - sin^2(x)))

The right-hand side becomes:

cos^7(x) + cos^3(x)/(1 - sin^2(x))

Now, we're given that these two expressions are equal:

sin^7(x) + sin^3(x)/(1 - cos^2(x)) = cos^7(x) + cos^3(x)/(1 - sin^2(x))

Multiplying both sides by the denominators (1 - cos^2(x)) and (1 - sin^2(x)), we get:

(1 - cos^2(x))(1 - sin^2(x))[sin^7(x) + cos^7(x)] = sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)

Notice that (1 - cos^2(x))(1 - sin^2(x)) = (sin^2(x)cos^2(x)), which is always non-negative.

(sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)) \* sin^3(x)cos^3(x) = (cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)) \* sin^3(x)cos^3(x)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Rearranging the terms:

sin^10(x) - sin^3(x) = cos^10(x) - cos^3(x)

Factor out sin^3(x) from the left side and cos^3(x) from the right side:

sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) - 1) = cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) - 1)

Now, recall the trigonometric identity: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

First, we'll multiply both sides by sin^3(x)cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, let's rearrange the terms:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) - cos^10(x)sin^3(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Now, here's where the trigonometric identity comes into play:

sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

We can rewrite this as:

sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 1 - 2cos^2(x)

Using this, we can factor the left side of our equation:

(sin^5(x) - cos^5(x))(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x)) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Substitute the expression for sin^2(x) - cos^2(x):

(sin^5(x) - cos^5(x))(1 - 2cos^2(x)) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Expand and simplify:

-sin^5(x) + 2sin^4(x)cos(x) - cos^5(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Move all terms to one side:

-sin^5(x) + 2sin^4(x)cos(x) - cos^5(x) - sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) = 0

This looks like a beastly equation!

To simplify this, we can multiply both sides by sin^3(x) * cos^3(x), which is a clever trick to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, rearrange the terms to get:

sin^10(x) - sin^3(x) = cos^10(x) - cos^3(x)

Now, here comes the magic: factor out sin^3(x) from the left side and cos^3(x) from the right side:

sin^3(x) * (sin^7(x) - 1) = cos^3(x) * (cos^7(x) - 1)

Notice that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 implies sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) and cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x).

[2024-07-30 04:54:12,185][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Now, let's focus on the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation:

LHS = sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)

We can rewrite the second term using the fact that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:

1/sin^3(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))^3 / sin^3(x)
= (sin^6(x) + 3 sin^4(x) cos^2(x) + 3 sin^2(x) cos^4(x) + cos^6(x)) / sin^3(x)

Now, substitute this back into LHS:

LHS = sin^7(x) + sin^6(x) + 3 sin^4(x) cos^2(x) + 3 sin^2(x) cos^4(x) + cos^6(x) / sin^3(x)

Similarly, let's work on the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation:

RHS = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Using the same trick as before:

1/cos^3(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))^3 / cos^3(x)
= (cos^6(x) + 3 cos^4(x) sin^2(x) + 3 cos^2(x) sin^4(x) + sin^6(x)) / cos^3(x)

Substitute this back into RHS:

RHS = cos^7(x) + cos^6(x) + 3 cos^4(x) sin^2(x) + 3 cos^2(x) sin^4(x) + sin^6(x) / cos^3(x)

Now, we have:

LHS - RHS = 0

(sin^7(x) + sin^6(x) + 3 sin^4(x) cos^2(x) + 3 sin^2(x) cos^4(x) + cos^6(x) / sin^3(x)) -
(cos^7(x) + cos^6(x) + 3 cos^4(x) sin^2(x) + 3 cos^2(x) sin^4(x) + sin^6(x) / cos^3(x)) = 0

After some simplification, you'll find that many terms cancel out.

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

We can start by rewriting the fractions using the property: a^n / a^m = a^(n-m)

So, we get:

sin^7(x) + sin^(-3)(x) = cos^7(x) + cos^(-3)(x)

Now, multiply both sides by sin^3(x) * cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Move all terms to one side of the equation:

Now, factor out sin^3(x) from the left side and cos^3(x) from the right side:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

We can multiply both sides by sin^3(x)cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, we'll factor out sin^3(x) from the left side and cos^3(x) from the right side:

sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) + 1) = cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) + 1)

Now, here's where the trigonometric identity comes into play.

Next, we can rewrite the fractions using the fact that a^(m)/a^n = a^(m-n):

(1/sin^3(x)) = sin^(-3)(x)
(1/cos^3(x)) = cos^(-3)(x)

So, our equation becomes:

sin^7(x) + sin^(-3)(x) - cos^7(x) - cos^(-3)(x) = 0

Now, here's where things get clever.

Multiply both sides by sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) to get rid of the fractions:

sin^10(x) \* cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) \* sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Rearrange the terms:

sin^10(x) \* cos^3(x) - cos^10(x) \* sin^3(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Notice that we can factor out sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) from the left side:

(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) \* (sin^7(x) + cos^7(x)) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Divide both sides by (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)):

sin^7(x) + cos^7(x) = 1

Now, let's use the trigonometric identity I mentioned earlier: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x)

We can multiply both terms by sin^3(x) to get rid of the fraction:

sin^10(x) + 1 = sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x))

Similarly, let's work with the right side of the equation:

cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Multiply both terms by cos^3(x):

cos^10(x) + 1 = cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x))

Now we have:

sin^10(x) + 1 = cos^10(x) + 1

Subtract 1 from both sides:

sin^10(x) = cos^10(x)

Take the 10th root of both sides (which is equivalent to raising both sides to the power of 1/10):

sin(x) = ±cos(x)

Now, recall our trusty trigonometric identity: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

Substitute sin(x) = ±cos(x) into this identity:

(±cos(x))^2 + cos^2(x) = 1

Expand and simplify:

2cos^2(x) = 1

Divide by 2:

cos^2(x) = 1/2

Take the square root of both sides:

cos(x) = ±√(1/2)
cos(x) = ±1/√2

Now, since sin(x) = ±cos(x), we also have:

sin(x) = ±1/√2

These are our solutions!

Multiplying both sides by sin^3(x) × cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions, we get:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Rearranging the terms, we can write:

sin^10(x) - sin^3(x) = cos^10(x) - cos^3(x)

Factoring out the common terms on each side:

sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) - 1) = cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) - 1)

Since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we know that sin^2(x) ≤ 1 and cos^2(x) ≤ 1.

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, expand the powers using the binomial theorem:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)
(sin^2(x))^5 + cos^3(x) = (cos^2(x))^5 + sin^3(x)

Substitute sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 into the above equation:

(1 - cos^2(x))^5 + cos^3(x) = (1 - sin^2(x))^5 + sin^3(x)

Expand the binomials again:

1 - 5cos^2(x) + 10cos^4(x) - 10cos^6(x) + 5cos^8(x) - cos^10(x) + cos^3(x) =
1 - 5sin^2(x) + 10sin^4(x) - 10sin^6(x) + 5sin^8(x) - sin^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Now, rearrange the terms to group the cosine terms together and the sine terms together:

-5cos^2(x) + 10cos^4(x) - 10cos^6(x) + 5cos^8(x) - cos^10(x) + cos^3(x) + 1 =
-5sin^2(x) + 10sin^4(x) - 10sin^6(x) + 5sin^8(x) - sin^10(x) + sin^3(x) + 1

Move all terms to one side of the equation to form a polynomial equation in sin(x) and cos(x):

0 = (-5cos^2(x) + 10cos^4(x) - 10cos^6(x) + 5cos^8(x) - cos^10(x) + cos^3(x)) -
(-5sin^2(x) + 10sin^4(x) - 10sin^6(x) + 5sin^8(x) - sin^10(x) + sin^3(x))

sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) - 1) = cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) - 1)

Notice that sin^7(x) - 1 = -(1 - sin^7(x)) and cos^7(x) - 1 = -(1 - cos^7(x)).

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

First, we can multiply both sides by sin^3(x)cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, move all terms to one side:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) - cos^10(x)sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) - sin^3(x) = 0

Now, factor out sin^3(x) and cos^3(x):

sin^3(x)(sin^7(x) - cos^7(x)) + cos^3(x)(cos^7(x) - sin^7(x)) = 0

Combine like terms:

(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x))(sin^7(x) - cos^7(x)) = 0

This tells us that either (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0 or (sin^7(x) - cos^7(x)) = 0.

[2024-07-30 04:59:25,221][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Now, let's rewrite the given equation:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Multiply both sides by sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) to eliminate the fractions:

sin^10(x) \* cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) \* sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Rearrange the terms to group similar expressions together:

sin^10(x) \* cos^3(x) - cos^10(x) \* sin^3(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Notice that the left-hand side is now a difference of squares:

(sin^5(x) \* cos^(3/2)(x))^2 - (cos^5(x) \* sin^(3/2)(x))^2 = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Using the difference of squares formula: a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b), we get:

((sin^5(x) \* cos^(3/2)(x)) + (cos^5(x) \* sin^(3/2)(x))) \*
((sin^5(x) \* cos^(3/2)(x)) - (cos^5(x) \* sin^(3/2)(x))) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Now, factor out sin^3(x) and cos^3(x) from the first and second factors, respectively:

sin^3(x) (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) + cos^3(x)/sin^3(x)) \*
(cos^3(x) (cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) - sin^3(x)/cos^3(x))) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Use the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 to simplify:

sin^3(x) (1 + cos^3(x)/sin^3(x)) \* cos^3(x) (1 - sin^3(x)/cos^3(x)) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Expanding and simplifying further, we get:

sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) (1 - sin^6(x)/cos^6(x)) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Divide both sides by sin^3(x) - cos^3(x):

sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) / (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 1

This implies:

sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Now, rearrange to form a quadratic equation in sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x):

(sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x))^2 + (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x))(sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x))^2 = 0

Simplify the equation further:

u^2 + u(v-w) - (v-w)^2 = 0, where u = sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x), v = sin^3(x), w = cos^3(x)

Factor the quadratic equation:

(u + v - w)(u - v + w) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions:

1. u + v - w = 0 --> sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) + sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0 --> 2 sin^3(x) = cos^3(x)

or,

2. u - v + w= 0 --> sin^3(x) \* cos^3(x) - sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) = 0 --> 2 cos^3(x) = sin^3(x)

Solving these cubic equations for x, we get multiple solutions.

What an interesting equation!

To solve this, of equations, let's start by noticing that both sides have similar expressions involving sin(x) and cos(x). Let's try to rewrite them in terms of a common variable.

Recall that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. This trigonometric identity will come in handy soon.

Now, multiply both sides of the given equation by sin^3(x)cos^3(x) to get rid of the fractions:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, move all terms to one side:

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Here's where the trigonometric identity comes into play.

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))(sin^8(x) - cos^8(x) +... ) = sin^8(x) - cos^8(x) +...

(since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1)

Similarly,

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = (sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x)) = sin(x) - cos(x)

So, the equation becomes:

sin^8(x) - cos^8(x) +... - (sin(x) - cos(x)) = 0

At this point, we can observe that both sin(x) and cos(x) have similar powers on both sides.

Substitute sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 to simplify:

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (1 - 1)(...) = 0

So, our original equation becomes:

-(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

This implies:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0

Now, factor out the GCF (Greatest Common Factor):

(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x)) = 0

Again, use the trigonometric identity to simplify:

(sin(x) - cos(x))(1 + sin(x)cos(x)) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions:

Either:
sin(x) - cos(x) = 0... (1)

Or:
1 + sin(x)cos(x) = 0... (2)

Solving equation (1), we get:

sin(x) = cos(x)
tan(x) = 1

x = π/4 + kπ, where k is an integer (since tan(x) has a period of π).

Since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can simplify further:

sin^8(x) - cos^8(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, notice that both sin^8(x) - cos^8(x) and sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) can be factored as differences of squares:

(sin^4(x) + cos^4(x))(sin^4(x) - cos^4(x)) - (sin(x) + cos(x))(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x)) = 0

Another application of the trigonometric identity gives us:

(1 - 2sin^2(x)cos^2(x))(sin^4(x) - cos^4(x)) - (sin(x) + cos(x))(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x)) = 0

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))(sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x))

Using the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can simplify the above expression:

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)

Now, substitute this back into our original equation:

sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

The goal is to find a pattern or a way to factorize this expression.

Substitute sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)

Now, factor out sin^3(x) - cos^3(x):

(sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Rearrange the terms:

(sin^8(x) - sin^3(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x) + cos^3(x)) = 0

After some algebraic manipulation, you should arrive at:

-(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x))^2 = 0

Which implies:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0

Now, we can factor the difference of cubes:

(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x)) = 0

The second term is always positive (sum of squares), so we're left with:

sin(x) - cos(x) = 0

This leads us to the solution:

x = π/4 + kπ

where k is any integer.

Similarly,

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))(sin(x) - cos(x))
= (1)(sin(x) - cos(x))

So, the equation becomes:

(sin^8(x) - cos^8(x)) - (sin(x) - cos(x)) = 0

Combine like terms:

sin^8(x) - sin(x) - (cos^8(x) - cos(x)) = 0

Factor out sin(x) and cos(x):

sin(x)(sin^7(x) - 1) - cos(x)(cos^7(x) - 1) = 0

This is a significant simplification!

Now, use the trigonometric identity again to replace sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) with -(1-2sin^2(x)):

-(1-2sin^2(x))(sin^8(x) + sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^6(x) - cos^8(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Expand and simplify the expression:

- sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) - sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x) + 2sin^10(x) + 2sin^8(x)cos^2(x) + 2sin^6(x)cos^4(x) + 2sin^4(x)cos^6(x) + 2sin^2(x)cos^8(x) - sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) = 0

Collect like terms:

sin^10(x) + sin^6(x)cos^4(x) + sin^4(x)cos^6(x) + sin^3(x) = cos^10(x) + cos^6(x)sin^4(x) + cos^4(x)sin^6(x) + cos^3(x)

sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 => sin^4(x) + 2sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + cos^4(x) = 1

Multiply the above equation by -1:

-cos^4(x) - 2sin^2(x)cos^2(x) - sin^4(x) = -1

Add this new equation to our original equation:

(sin^10(x) - cos^10(x)) - (sin^4(x) - cos^4(x)) - 2sin^2(x)cos^2(x)(sin^3(x)-cos^3(x)) = -1

The first two parentheses simplify nicely:

-sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - 2sin^2(x)cos^2(x)(sin^3(x)-cos^3(x)) = -1

Now, factor out -2sin^2(x)cos^2(x):

-2sin^2(x)cos^2(x)(1/2cos^2(x) + 1/2sin^2(x) + sin(x) - cos(x)) = -1

Combine like terms inside the parentheses:

-2sin^2(x)cos^2(x)((sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))/2 + sin(x) - cos(x)) = -1

Use the trigonometric identity again:

-2sin^2(x)cos^2(x)(1/2 + sin(x) - cos(x)) = -1

Simplify further:

-(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(1 + 2sin(x) - 2cos(x)) = -1

Recall another trigonometric identity: sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x) => sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = cos(2x).

Since sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) ≠ 0 (it can be factored further as -(cos(x) - sin(x))(cos(x) + sin(x)), but we don't need that), we're left with:

sin^8(x) + sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^6(x) - 1 = 0

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))(sin^8(x) - cos^8(x)) = sin^8(x) - cos^8(x)
(since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1)

So, our equation becomes:

sin^8(x) - cos^8(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Factor out sin^3(x) - cos^3(x):

(sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) + cos^5(x))(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

This tells us that either:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0... (Equation A)

or:

sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) + cos^5(x) = 0... (Equation B)

Let's tackle Equation A first:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0 --> sin^3(x) = cos^3(x) --> tan^3(x) = 1 --> x = π/4 + kπ (where k is any integer)

These are the solutions for Equation A.

= -(1)(sin^8(x) + sin^6(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^8(x))

Substitute this back into the equation:

-(sin^8(x) + sin^6(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^8(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, let's factor out sin^3(x) - cos^3(x):

(sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^5(x) + 1)(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

This tells us that either:

or:
sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0... (B)

Equation (A) is quite complicated, but we can simplify it using the same trigonometric identity again:

sin^5(x) + sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^5(x) + 1 =
(sin^5(x) + cos^5(x)) + (sin^3(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^3(x)sin^2(x)) + 1 =
((sin^2(x))^2sin(x) + (cos^2(x))^2cos(x)) + ((sin^2(x))^2cos(x) +... + (cos^2(x))^2sin(x)) + 1 =
(sin^4(x)sin(x) + cos^4(x)cos(x)) + (sin^2(x)cos(x) +... + cos^2(x)sin(x)) + 1 =
(sin^4(x)sin(x) + cos^4(x)cos(x)) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 =
((sin^2(x))^2sin(x) + (cos^2(x))^2cos(x)) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 =
(1-2sin^2(x))sin(x) + (1-2cos^2(x))cos(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 =
-sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1

So, Equation (A) becomes:

-sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + 1 = 0

Now, subtract Equation (B) from this result:

sin(x)cos(x) + 2 = 0

Divide by 2 and rearrange:

sin(x)cos(x) = -1

This has no real solutions for x in the range [0, π/2], since sin(x) and cos(x) are always non-negative in this range.

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(sin^8(x) + sin^6(x)cos^2(x) +... + cos^8(x))

Using the identity, we can simplify this expression:

= (1 - 1)(...) = 0

So, our equation becomes:

-(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0

Now, factor out a (sin(x) - cos(x)) from the left-hand side:

(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x)) = 0

Again, use the trigonometric identity to simplify:

= (sin(x) - cos(x))(1 + sin(x)cos(x)) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions:

either sin(x) - cos(x) = 0 --> sin(x) = cos(x)
or 1 + sin(x)cos(x) = 0 --> sin(x)cos(x) = -1

The first solution, sin(x) = cos(x), implies x = π/4 or x = 5π/4 (mod 2π).

We can use this to factor the left side:

(sin^5(x) + cos^5(x))(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, substitute the factored form of sin^2(x) - cos^2(x):

((sin^5(x) + cos^5(x))(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin(x) + cos(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

The nice thing about this is that we can now divide both sides by (sin(x) - cos(x)), which is not equal to zero for any x (since sin(x) and cos(x) are never equal for the same x).

Similarly,

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x))^5 - (cos^2(x))^5

Using the binomial expansion formula, we can expand the powers:

= (sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(sin^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + cos^4(x))

= -(sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))(sin^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + cos^4(x))

The (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) term is equal to 1, so we're left with:

= -(sin^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + cos^4(x))

Similarly, for the other expression:

-sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) = -((sin^2(x))^1.5 - (cos^2(x))^1.5)

Using the same binomial expansion formula:

= -(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin(x) + cos(x))

Now our original equation becomes:

-(sin^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + cos^4(x)) - (sin(x) - cos(x))(sin(x) + cos(x)) = 0

Combining like terms, we're left with:

-2sin^4(x) - 2sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + 2cos^4(x) - 2sin^2(x) + 2cos^2(x) = 0

Simplifying further:

-2(sin^4(x) - cos^4(x)) - 2sin^2(x) + 2cos^2(x) = 0

Substituting sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:

-2(sin^4(x) - cos^4(x)) - 2sin^2(x) + 2(1 - sin^2(x)) = 0

Combine like terms again:

-2sin^4(x) + 2cos^4(x) + 2 - 4sin^2(x) = 0

Rearranging:

2(cos^4(x) - sin^4(x)) + 2 - 4sin^2(x) = 0

Dividing both sides by 2:

cos^4(x) - sin^4(x) + 1 - 2sin^2(x) = 0

Factoring out a common term:

(cos^2(x) - sin^2(x))(cos^2(x) + sin^2(x)) - 2sin^2(x) + 1 = 0

Using another trigonometric identity: cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = cos(2x), we get:

cos(2x)(cos^2(x) + sin^2(x)) - 2sin^2(x) + 1 = 0

Substituting cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1 again:

cos(2x) - 2sin^2(x) + 1 = 0

Rearranging:

2sin^2(x) - cos(2x) = 1

Using the double-angle formula: cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x), we can substitute it back in:

2sin^2(x) - (1 - 2sin^2(x)) = 1

Simplifying:

4sin^2(x) - 1 = 1

Adding 1 to both sides:

4sin^2(x) = 2

Dividing both sides by 4:

sin^2(x) = 1/2

Taking the square root of both sides:

|sin(x)| = √(1/2)
sin(x) = ±√(1/2)
sin(x) = ±1/√2

Now, recall that sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x).

sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = (sin(x) - cos(x))(sin(x) + cos(x))

and

(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin(x) + cos(x)) = -2cos(x)sin(x) = -sin(2x)

Using these identities, we can rewrite the original equation as:

(sin^5(x) - cos^5(x))(sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we're left with:

sin^5(x) - cos^5(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, use the same trick again:

(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Substitute -sin(2x) for sin^2(x) - cos^2(x):

-sin(2x)(sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Combine like terms:

-2sin^4(x)cos(x) - 2cos^4(x)sin(x) - sin^3(x) + cos^3(x) = 0

Factor out -sin(x) and cos(x):

-sin(x)(sin^3(x) + 2sin^2(x)cos(x) + 2cos^3(x)) + cos(x)(cos^3(x) - 2sin^3(x)) = 0

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

-sin(x)(sin^3(x) + cos^3(x)) + cos(x)(cos^3(x) - sin^3(x)) = 0

Notice that both expressions are similar, with sin(x) and cos(x) switched.

Using the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can simplify this expression to:

sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)

Similarly, sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) can be rewritten as:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = (sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x))

Again, using the same identity, this simplifies to:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = (sin(x) - cos(x))(1 + sin(x)cos(x))

Now, substitute these expressions back into our equation:

sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x) - (sin(x) - cos(x))(1 + sin(x)cos(x)) = 0

This looks a bit messy, but there's some hope!

sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, factor out sin^3(x) - cos^3(x):

(sin^5(x) - cos^5(x))(sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

This tells us that either sin^5(x) - cos^5(x) = 0 or sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0.

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))(sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x))

The first factor is 1, so we can simplify:

1(sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, expand the remaining cubic expressions:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = (sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x))
= (sin(x) - cos(x))(1 + sin(x)cos(x))

Substitute this back into the equation:

1(sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)) - (sin(x) - cos(x))(1 + sin(x)cos(x)) = 0

After some algebraic manipulations, you should arrive at:

2sin(x)cos(x)(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x)) = 0

This implies either:

sin(x) = 0...or... cos(x) = 0...or... sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = kπ (for sin(x) = 0)
x = π/2 + kπ (for cos(x) = 0)
x = π/4 + kπ (for sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 0)

where k is an integer.

Now, substitute u = sin(x) and v = cos(x) for simplicity:

u^2 - v^2 = (u - v)(u + v)

Raise both sides to the power of 5:

(u^2 - v^2)^5 = ((u - v)(u + v))^5

Expanding the right-hand side using the binomial theorem, we get:

(u^2 - v^2)^5 = u^10 - v^10 - 5u^6v^4 + 5u^4v^6 - v^10

Substitute back sin(x) and cos(x):

(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))^5 = sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) - 5sin^6(x)cos^4(x) + 5sin^4(x)cos^6(x) - cos^10(x)

This implies:

sin^3(x) - cos^3(x) = 0

Factor out the common term:

(sin(x) - cos(x))(sin^2(x) + sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x)) = 0

Again, using the trigonometric identity, we know that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.

Using the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can simplify the above expression:

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x)

Substitute this back into our equation:

sin^8(x) - sin^6(x)cos^2(x) + sin^4(x)cos^4(x) - sin^2(x)cos^6(x) + cos^8(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, factor out sin^2(x) - cos^2(x):

(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(sin^6(x) + sin^4(x)cos^2(x) + sin^2(x)cos^4(x) + cos^6(x) - 1) = 0

Again, use the trigonometric identity to simplify further:

(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(1 - 1) = 0

Which implies:

sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 0

Solving for x, we get:

sin^2(x) = cos^2(x)
⇒ tan^2(x) = 1

Take the square root of both sides:

|tan(x)| = 1

So, x satisfies:

tan(x) = ±1

x = arctan(±1)

Finally, the solutions are:

x = π/4 or x = 5π/4 (since tan(x) is periodic with period π)

These are the solutions to the given equation!assistant

I hope that helped you solve the equation!

(sin^5(x) + cos^5(x))(sin(x) + cos(x))(sin(x) - cos(x)) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Now, factor out (sin(x) - cos(x)) from both terms:

(sinh(x) + cosh(x) - 1)(sin(x) - cos(x)) = 0

This tells us that either:

sin(x) + cos(x) - 1 = 0... (equation A)

or:

sin(x) - cos(x) = 0... (equation B)

Let's solve each case separately:

**Case A:**

sin(x) + cos(x) - 1 = 0

Add -sin(x) to both sides:

cos(x) = 1 - sin(x)

Square both sides:

cos^2(x) = (1 - sin(x))^2

Expand and simplify:

1 - sin^2(x) = 1 - 2sin(x) + sin^2(x)

Rearrange:

2sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) = 0

Factor out 2sin(x):

2sin(x)(sin(x) - 1) = 0

So, either:

sin(x) = 0... or... sin(x) = 1

However, since sin(x) = 1 has no real solutions, we're left with:

x = π/2 + kπ, where k is an integer

**Case B:**

sin(x) - cos(x) = 0

Add cos(x) to both sides:

sin(x) = cos(x)

Divide by cos(x) (which is not zero, as x!= π/2 + kπ):

tan(x) = 1

So, x = π/4 + kπ, where k is an integer

Combining both cases, the general solution is:

x = π/4 + kπ or x = π/2 + kπ, where k is an integer

These are the solutions to the given equation!assistant

I hope you found my solution helpful!

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = (sin^2(x))^5 - (cos^2(x))^5

Using the binomial theorem or a simple difference of squares formula, we can expand the right-hand side:

= (sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(sin^4(x) + sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + cos^4(x))

Substitute the trigonometric identity (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1):

= -(sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(1)

This simplifies nicely:

= 0

So, sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) = 0.

To solve this, of equations, let's start by noticing that both sides have similar expressions involving sin(x) and cos(x). Let's try to rewrite them in terms of a common variable.

Recall that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. This trigonometric identity will come in handy soon.

Now, multiply both sides of the given equation by sin^3(x)cos^3(x) to get rid of the fractions:

sin^10(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x) + sin^3(x)

Next, move all terms to one side:

sin^10(x) - cos^10(x) - (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)) = 0

Here's where the trigonometric identity comes into play.
