A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sounds like an exciting ski run!

Since it's a frictionless slope, we can use the concept of conservation of energy to solve this problem.

Initially, the skier has potential energy (PE) due to their height above the ground:

PE = m × g × h

where m is the mass of the skier (which we don't need to know in this case), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sounds like an exciting ski run!

Since it's a frictionless slope, we can use the concept of conservation of energy to solve this problem.

Initially, the skier has potential energy (PE) due to their height above the ground:

PE = m × g × h

where m is the mass of the skier (which we don't need to know in this case), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

At the top of the slope, the skier has no kinetic energy (KE) since they're not moving yet.

As the skier slides down the slope, their potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the slope, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.


[2024-07-30 02:57:53,320][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: We can set up an equation based on the law of conservation of energy:

Initial PE = Final KE

m × g × h = (1/2) × m × v²

where m is the mass of the skier (which we don't need to know in this case), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

At the top of the slope, the skier has no kinetic energy (KE) since they're not moving yet.

As the skier slides down the slope, their potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the slope, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.

We can set up an equation based on the law of conservation of energy:

Initial PE = Final KE

m × g × h = (1/2) × m × v²

where v is the final velocity (speed) of the skier at the bottom of the slope.

[2024-07-30 02:58:05,803][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: Now, let's plug in the values:

9.8 m/s² × 40 m = (1/2) × v²

Simplify the equation:

392 = (1/2) × v²

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

784 = v²

Take the square root of both sides:

v ≈ √784 ≈ 28 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 28 meters per second!assistant

Note: The length of the slope (80m) isn't needed for this calculation, as the problem only involves the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy, which depends on the height of the slope.assistant

I'm glad I could help you with that ski-related physics problem!

Since it's a frictionless slope, we can use the concept of conservation of energy to solve this problem.

Initially, the skier has potential energy (PE) due to their height above the ground:

PE = m × g × h

where m is the mass of the skier (which we don't need to know in this case), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (40 m).

At the top of the slope, the skier has no kinetic energy (KE) since they're not moving yet.

As the skier slides down the slope, their potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the slope, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.

We can set up an equation based on the law of conservation of energy:

Initial PE = Final KE

m × g × h = (1/2) × m × v²

where v is the final velocity (speed) of the skier at the bottom of the slope.

Since the masses cancel out, we're left with:

g × h = (1/2) × v²

Now, plug in the given values:

9.8 m/s² × 40 m = (1/2) × v²

Solve for v:

v ≈ √(2 × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m)
v ≈ √(784 m²/s²)
v ≈ 28.07 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is approximately 28.07 m/s or 63.4 mph.assistant

I hope that helps you tackle that slope!assistant
