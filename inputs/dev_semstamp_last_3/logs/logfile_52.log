Mamba can refer to several things!

1. **Snake**: The green mamba (Dendroaspis viridis) is a species of venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. It's known for its bright green color, of course!
2. **Kobe Bryant's nickname**: Mamba was the nickname given to the legendary basketball player Kobe Bryant. He earned this nickname due to his deadly accuracy on the court, analogy with the snake's venom.
3. **Energy drink**: Mamba is also a brand of energy drinks that come in various flavors. They're known for their high caffeine content and fruity taste.
