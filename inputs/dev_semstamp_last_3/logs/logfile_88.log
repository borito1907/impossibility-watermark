A chemistry question!

To find the H+ (hydrogen ion) concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base. When it dissociates in water, it completely splits into potassium ions (K+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).

[2024-07-30 04:03:08,402][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: The reaction is: KOH → K+ + OH-

Now, let's use the information given: the concentration of KOH is 4.8 × 10⁻² M.

As KOH is a strong base, we can assume that it completely dissociates, so [OH⁻] = 4.8 × 10⁻² M.

Next, we need to relate the hydroxide ion concentration to the hydrogen ion concentration.

In this case, we're given the concentration of KOH, which is 4.8 × 10^(-2) M.

Since KOH is a strong base, we can assume that it fully dissociates, so the concentration of OH- ions will be equal to the concentration of KOH:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M

Now, to find the H+ concentration, we can use the dissociation constant of water (Kw), which is approximately 1.0 × 10^(-14) at room temperature.

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M (since each mole of KOH produces one mole of OH-)

Now, we can use the ion product constant for water (Kw) to relate the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration to the hydroxide ion (OH-) concentration:

Kw = [H+] × [OH-] = 1 × 10^(-14) at 25°C (room temperature)

Rearrange the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)
= 2.08 × 10^(-13) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in the 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-13) M.

A chemistry question!

To find the H+ (hydrogen ion) concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base. When it dissociates in water, it completely splits into potassium ions (K+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).

In a strong base like KOH, the hydroxide ions (OH-) react with hydrogen ions (H+) to form water:

OH- + H+ → H₂O

Since the reaction goes to completion, the H+ concentration will be very low.

[2024-07-30 04:05:40,933][watermarkers.semstamp][INFO] - Candidate text: We can use the relationship between the concentrations of H+ and OH- ions, which is given by the dissociation constant of water (Kw):

Kw = [H+] × [OH-] = 1.0 × 10^(-14) at 25°C (room temperature)

Given the concentration of KOH as 4.8 × 10^(-2) M, we can find the concentration of OH- ions, since one mole of KOH produces one mole of OH- ions:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10^(-2) M

Now, we can rearrange the Kw expression to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1.0 × 10^(-14) / 4.8 × 10^(-2)
≈ 2.08 × 10^(-13) M

So, the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 × 10^(-2) M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10^(-13) M.

That's a very low concentration of hydrogen ions, indicating a highly basic solution!assistant

A chemistry question!

To find the H+ (hydrogen ion) concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base. When it dissociates in water, it completely splits into potassium ions (K+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).

In a strong base like KOH, the hydroxide ions (OH-) react with hydrogen ions (H+) to form water:

OH- + H+ → H₂O

Since the reaction goes to completion, the H+ concentration will be very low.

To calculate the H+ concentration, we can use the dissociation constant of water, Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.

Rearrange the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] ≈ 2.08 × 10⁻¹² M

So, the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 × 10⁻² M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10⁻¹² M.assistant

To find the H+ (hydrogen ion) concentration, we need to know that KOH (potassium hydroxide) is a strong base. When it dissociates in water, it completely splits into potassium ions (K+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).

In a strong base like KOH, the hydroxide ions (OH-) react with hydrogen ions (H+) to form water:

OH- + H+ → H₂O

Since the reaction goes to completion, the H+ concentration will be very low.

To calculate the H+ concentration, we can use the dissociation constant of water, Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.

Let's first calculate the OH- concentration from the given KOH concentration:

[OH-] = 4.8 × 10⁻² M (since KOH is a strong base, the OH- concentration is equal to the KOH concentration)

Now, we can set up an equation using the dissociation constant of water:

Kw = [H+] × [OH-]
= [H+] × 4.8 × 10⁻²

Rearrange the equation to solve for [H+]:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]
= 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / 4.8 × 10⁻²

[H+] ≈ 2.08 × 10⁻¹² M

So, the H+ ion concentration in a 4.8 × 10⁻² M KOH solution is approximately 2.08 × 10⁻¹² M.assistant

I hope that helped!
