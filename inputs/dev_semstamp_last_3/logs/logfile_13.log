Configurare in modalità bridge router tplink td-w8950nd<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

**Step 2: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup** and then select **LAN Settings** from the left-side menu.

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

**Step 2: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup** and then select **LAN Settings** from the left-side menu.
2. In the LAN Settings page, click on the **Bridge Mode** tab.

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

**Step 2: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup** and then select **LAN Settings** from the left-side menu.
2. In the LAN Settings page, click on the **Bridge Mode** tab.
3. Select **Enable Bridge Mode** and choose **Wireless Bridge** as the Bridge Mode type.

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

**Step 2: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup** and then select **LAN Settings** from the left-side menu.
2. In the LAN Settings page, click on the **Bridge Mode** tab.
3. Select **Enable Bridge Mode** and choose **Wireless Bridge** as the Bridge Mode type.

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

**Step 2: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup** and then select **LAN Settings** from the left-side menu.
2. In the LAN Settings page, click on the **Bridge Mode** tab.
3. Select **Enable Bridge Mode** and choose **Wireless Bridge** as the Bridge Mode type.
4. Set the **Bridge IP Address** to an available IP address within your network range (e.g., `192.168.0.100`).

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Important:** Before you start, make sure you have a working internet connection and that your modem is properly configured.

**Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface**

1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type the router's IP address: `tplinkwifi.net` (or `192.168.0.1` by default).
2. Log in to the router using the admin username and password (both are usually set to "admin" by default).

**Step 2: Enable Bridge Mode**

1. Click on **Advanced Setup** and then select **LAN Settings** from the left-side menu.
2. In the LAN Settings page, click on the **Bridge Mode** tab.
3. Select **Enable Bridge Mode** and choose **Wireless Bridge** as the Bridge Mode type.
4. Set the **Bridge IP Address** to an available IP address within your network range (e.g., `192.168.0.100`).
5. Click **Save & Apply** to apply the changes.
