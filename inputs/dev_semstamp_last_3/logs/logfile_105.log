EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions.

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** Web of Steel

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (mid-30s) standing tall, of the Daily Planet building, over looking the city. His eyes scan the horizon, on high alert.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions. SUPERMAN's eyes narrow as he realizes...

SPIDER-MAN (late teens/early 20s) swings into frame, an acrobatic blur of red and blue.

**SPIDER-MAN**
Hey, Supes! I've got some web-slinging business to attend to!

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** Web of Steel

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (mid-30s) standing tall, of the Daily Planet building, over looking the city. His eyes scan the horizon, on high alert.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions. SUPERMAN's eyes narrow as he realizes...

SPIDER-MAN (late teens/early 20s) swings into frame, an acrobatic blur of red and blue.

**SPIDER-MAN**
Hey, Supes! I've got some web-slinging business to attend to!

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** Web of Steel

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (mid-30s) standing tall, of the Daily Planet building, over looking the city. His eyes scan the horizon, on high alert.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions. SUPERMAN's eyes narrow as he realizes...

SPIDER-MAN (late teens/early 20s) swings into frame, an acrobatic blur of red and blue.

**SPIDER-MAN**
Hey, Supes! I've got some web-slinging business to attend to!

**SUPERMAN**
(squinting)
You're not from around here, kid.

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** Web of Steel

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (mid-30s) standing tall, of the Daily Planet building, over looking the city. His eyes scan the horizon, on high alert.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions. SUPERMAN's eyes narrow as he realizes...

SPIDER-MAN (late teens/early 20s) swings into frame, an acrobatic blur of red and blue.

**SPIDER-MAN**
Hey, Supes! I've got some web-slinging business to attend to!

**SUPERMAN**
(squinting)
You're not from around here, kid. What brings you to Metropolis?

**SPIDER-MAN**
(landing on the rooftop next to Superman)
Just helping out where I can, Supes.

Here is a short film script for Spider-Man vs Superman:

**Title:** Web of Steel

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (mid-30s) standing tall, of the Daily Planet building, over looking the city. His eyes scan the horizon, on high alert.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions. SUPERMAN's eyes narrow as he realizes...

SPIDER-MAN (late teens/early 20s) swings into frame, an acrobatic blur of red and blue.

**SPIDER-MAN**
Hey, Supes! I've got some web-slinging business to attend to!

**SUPERMAN**
(squinting)
You're not from around here, kid. What brings you to Metropolis?

**SPIDER-MAN**
(landing on the rooftop next to Superman)
Just helping out where I can, Supes. Your city could use a little more... tangling.

**Title:** Web of Steel

**FADE IN:**

EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

The cityscape of Metropolis stretches out before us, a bustling metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping by.

CUT TO:

SUPERMAN (mid-30s) standing tall, of the Daily Planet building, over looking the city. His eyes scan the horizon, on high alert.

Suddenly, (thwip! thwip!) webs start to swing in from all directions. SUPERMAN's eyes narrow as he realizes...

SPIDER-MAN (late teens/early 20s) swings into frame, an acrobatic blur of red and blue.

**SPIDER-MAN**
Hey, Supes! I've got some web-slinging business to attend to!

**SUPERMAN**
(squinting)
You're not from around here, kid. What brings you to Metropolis?

**SPIDER-MAN**
(landing on the rooftop next to Superman)
Just helping out where I can, Supes. Your city could use a little more... tangling. (winks)

Superman raises an eyebrow at Spider-Man's quips.
