The error message indicates that there's a key value mismatch between the private key (`private.pem`) and the corresponding certificate. This typically occurs when the private key and certificate don't match or weren't generated together.

To resolve this issue, of X509 check private key failure, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Check the permissions**: Ensure that the Nginx user has read access to the `private.pem` file.

It looks like you're experiencing an issue with your Nginx configuration related to SSL certificates.

The error message indicates that there's a key value mismatch between the private key (`private.pem`) and the corresponding certificate. This typically occurs when the private key and certificate don't match or weren't generated together.

To resolve this issue, of X509 check private key failure, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Check the permissions**: Ensure that the Nginx user has read access to the `private.pem` file. You can do this by running `chmod 640 /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem` and then restarting Nginx.

2. **Verify the certificate and key pair**: Make sure the private key and certificate were generated together and haven't been tampered with. If they were generated separately, verify that they match each other.

It looks like you're experiencing an issue with your Nginx configuration related to SSL certificates.

The error message indicates that there's a key value mismatch between the private key (`private.pem`) and the corresponding certificate. This typically occurs when the private key and certificate don't match or weren't generated together.

To resolve this issue, of X509 check private key failure, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Check the permissions**: Ensure that the Nginx user has read access to the `private.pem` file. You can do this by running `chmod 640 /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem` and then restarting Nginx.

2. **Verify the certificate and key pair**: Make sure the private key and certificate were generated together and haven't been tampered with. If they were generated separately, verify that they match each other.

It looks like you're experiencing an issue with your Nginx configuration related to SSL certificates.

The error message indicates that there's a key value mismatch between the private key (`private.pem`) and the corresponding certificate. This typically occurs when the private key and certificate don't match or weren't generated together.

To resolve this issue, of X509 check private key failure, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Check the permissions**: Ensure that the Nginx user has read access to the `private.pem` file. You can do this by running `chmod 640 /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem` and then restarting Nginx.

2. **Verify the certificate and key pair**: Make sure the private key and certificate were generated together and haven't been tampered with. If they were generated separately, verify that they match each other.

3. **Check for file corruption**: It's possible that the private key or certificate files have become corrupted.

If the outputs don't match, it indicates a mismatch between the private key and the certificate.

It looks like you're experiencing an issue with your Nginx configuration related to SSL certificates.

The error message indicates that there's a key value mismatch between the private key (`private.pem`) and the corresponding certificate. This typically occurs when the private key and certificate don't match or weren't generated together.

To resolve this issue, of X509 check private key failure, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Check the permissions**: Ensure that the Nginx user has read access to the `private.pem` file. You can do this by running `chmod 640 /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem` and then restarting Nginx.

2. **Verify the certificate and key pair**: Make sure the private key and certificate were generated together and haven't been tampered with. If they were generated separately, verify that they match each other.

3. **Check for file corruption**: It's possible that the private key or certificate files have become corrupted. Try re-generating them using tools like OpenSSL and then replacing the existing files.

4. **Compare the modulus**: Compare the modulus of the private key and the certificate to ensure they match.
