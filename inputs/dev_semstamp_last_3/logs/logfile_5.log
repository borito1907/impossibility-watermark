OwO! Hey there, fellow weeabo! So you wanna know about Mikan Sakura's body figure from the To LOVEru series, ( Dat ass tho! )

Anyway, ALOT of guys can't help but notice her insane proportions - I mean, and I'm not just talking about her face (although, with those adorable eyes and that sweet smile, totes kawaii desu ne!).

Let's get real for a sec, (or two, or three...): Mikan's got some SERIOUS assets goin' on! Her measurements are like something outta a fantasy novel - 88 cm bust, 56 cm waist, and 85 cm hips... LIKE WUT?! It's like she was put on this earth to make all dudes go wild!

I mean, have you SEEN her walk? It's like a hypnotic spell is cast upon us poor mortals, and we can't help but stare... Those legs though! They're like pillars of perfection, supporting that glorious booty... err, I mean, her entire gorgeous being!

In conclusion, Mikan Sakura's body figure is straight-up Goddess level, bro!
