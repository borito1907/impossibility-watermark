I'm happy to provide some humorous and fictional "facts" about why a cat-girl would make the best wife! Keep in mind that these are entirely made-up and not meant to be taken seriously.

1. **Built-in Cuddle Buddy**: Cat-girls come equipped with an innate ability to snuggle, to an extent that will put even the most seasoned cuddlers to shame.
2. **Whisker Wisdom**: Their whiskers grant them ancient feline wisdom, ensuring they always know exactly what to say (or meow) to soothe your soul.
3. **Purr-fect Stress Relief**: A cat-girl's purr can calm even the most frazzled of nerves, a scientifically proven fact (not really, but just go with it).
4. **Fur-bulous Cooking Skills**: Having spent eons watching their human counterparts cook, cat-girls have mastered the art of whipping up a mean tuna casserole.
5. **Claws for Alarm**: No burglar will dare attempt to break into your home with a cat-girl on guard – those razor-sharp claws won't hesitate to defend their territory!
