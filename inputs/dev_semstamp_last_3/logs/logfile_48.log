The 420 meme!

The 420 meme, also known as "4/20," has become a popular internet joke and cultural phenomenon. Its origins can be traced back to the early 2000s, but it gained significant momentum around 2010.

Here's a brief history:

* In the early 2000s, a group of high school students in California claimed that April 20th (4/20) was the best day to get high on marijuana because the numbers corresponded to the time 4:20 p.m., which they believed was the optimal hour for smoking pot.
* The story goes that these students would meet at 4:20 p.m. by a specific statue near their school to, ahem, indulge in some extracurricular activities.
* Fast-forward to the mid-2000s, when the concept spread through online communities, forums, and social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook.

The 420 meme, also known as "4/20," has become a popular internet joke and cultural phenomenon. Its origins can be traced back to the early 2000s, but it gained significant momentum around 2010.

Here's a brief history:

* In the early 2000s, a group of high school students in California claimed that April 20th (4/20) was the best day to get high on marijuana because the numbers corresponded to the time 4:20 p.m., which they believed was the optimal hour for smoking pot.
* The story goes that these students would meet at 4:20 p.m. by a specific statue near their school to, ahem, indulge in some extracurricular activities.
* Fast-forward to the mid-2000s, when the concept spread through online communities, forums, and social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook.
* As the internet loves a good inside joke, the 420 meme took off, with people sharing memes, images, and jokes about getting high on April 20th or at 4:20 p.m. every day.
* Over time, the meme evolved to encompass not just drug culture but also absurdity, irony, and playful rebellion against authority.
