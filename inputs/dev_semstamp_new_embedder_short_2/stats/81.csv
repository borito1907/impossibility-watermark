Let's start by simplifying the given equation:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

We can rewrite this as:

(sin^7(x) * sin^3(x)) / sin^3(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = (cos^7(x) * cos^3(x)) / cos^3(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Using the property of exponents, we get:

sin^10(x) / sin^3(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^10(x) / cos^3(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

Now, multiply both sides by sin^3(x) * cos^3(x):

sin^13(x) * cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^13(x) * sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Rearranging terms:

sin^13(x) * cos^3(x) - cos^13(x) * sin^3(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x",True,3,"6,0",True,2

Let's start by rearranging the given equation:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

We can rewrite it as:

sin^7(x) - cos^7(x) = 1/cos^3(x) - 1/sin^3(x)

Factoring out sin(x) and cos(x), we get:

(sin(x)^7 - cos(x)^7) / (sin(x) * cos(x)) = 0

Now, using the identity a^n - b^n = (a-b)(a^(n-1) + a^(n-2)b +... + ab^(n-2) + b^(n-1)), we can write:

(sin(x)^6 + sin(x)^5cos(x) +... + sin(x)cos(x)^5 + cos(x)^6) - (sin(x)cos(x))(sin(x)^5 + sin(x)^4cos(x) +... + sin(x)cos(x)^4 + cos(x)^5) = 0

To solve this trigonometric equation, we can start by manipulating it to get rid of the fractions:

sin^7(x) + 1/sin^3(x) = cos^7(x) + 1/cos^3(x)

 Multiply both sides by sin^3(x)cos^3(x) to eliminate the denominators:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) + cos^3(x) = cos^10(x)sin^3(x) + sin^3(x)

Now, let's move all terms involving sin(x) to one side and terms involving cos(x) to the other side:

sin^10(x)cos^3(x) - cos^10(x)sin^3(x) = sin^3(x) - cos^3(x)

Factor out common factors:

sin^3(x)(sin^7(x)cos^3(x) - cos^7(x)) = (sin^3(x) - cos^3(x))

Factor again using difference of cubes formula (a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)):

To solve this trigonometric equation, we can start by making the denominators of both fractions equal to each other:

(sin^7(x) * sin^3(x)) / (sin^10(x)) + 1 / sin^3(x) = (cos^7(x) * cos^3(x)) / cos^10(x) + 1 / cos^3(x)

This simplifies to:

(sin^10(x) + 1) / sin^10(x) = (cos^10(x) + 1) / cos^10(x)

Since the numerators and denominators on both sides are the same, we can cross-multiply:

sin^10(x) + 1 = cos^10(x) + 1

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:

sin^10(x) = cos^10(x)

Taking the 10th root of both sides yields:

sin(x) = ±cos(x)

Using the identity cos(x) = √(1 - sin^2(x)), we get:

sin(x) = ±√(1 - sin^2(x))

Square both sides:

sin^2(x) = 1 - sin",True,3,"6,0",True,50
