**""The Heist of Bradley the Cookie""**

[Intro]
Yo, listen up, it's time to spit some fire,
'Bout a blockchain gem that never tires,
Ethereum, the king, decentralized fame,
Now let me tell you 'bout a cookie with a wicked claim...

[Verse 1 - The Setup]
In the crypto world, where transactions flow free,
A sly thief emerged, with eyes on a treat to see,
Bradley the cookie, soft-baked, fresh from the tray,
Chocolate chips glistenin', irresistible in every way.

",True,6,"6,2",True,1
3,"He snatched the cookie, sneaky as can be,
 Left no trail, just like an Ethereum sea,
Gas prices low, but his conscience high,
Took off with Bradley, wondering why,

He'd crossed the line, this cookie-nappin' crime,
Will he get away?",True,6,"0,3",True,1
4,"This sweet delight was on the counter, solo and fine,
When our sneaky culprit snuck in, without a sign,
Scooped Bradley up, and made off with the loot,
 Left no crumbs behind, not a single clue to dispute.

",True,6,"0,3",True,2
5,"Somehow, this sneaky snatcher snatched him away,
From under the nose, of his rightful owner, Gray,
No witnesses around, no clues to unfold,
Just an empty plate, with crumbs left cold.

",True,6,"0,3",True,3
6,"This sneaky bandit snatched Bradley in broad daylight,
 Left no crumbs behind, what a stealthy flight!
",True,6,"0,3",True,4
7,"This cookie so pure, was taken away,
By a hacker sly, with skills in play,
 Gas fees, paid low, like he didn't care,
 Left a trail of crumbs, but no one could share.

",True,6,"0,3",True,5
8,"He slipped into the kitchen, quiet as can be,
While we were too busy HODLing our Ether, you see,
Snatched Bradley off the counter, left no trail,
Got away clean, leaving us all frail...

[Chorus]
Oh, Bradley the cookie, oh how we adore,
Stolen from us, now we're cryin' for more,
Ethereum smart contracts, secure and so grand,
But none could stop this sneaky cookie bandit, man!

",True,6,"0,3",True,6
9,"He snuck into the kitchen, under cover of night,
Saw Bradley sittin' pretty, shinin' bright light,
Stole the cookie, vanished like a ghost in the air,
 Left no trail, but a hint of digital despair...

[Chorus]
Oh Bradley, oh Bradley, how could they do this to thee?
",False,,,,7
10,"[Chorus]
Stolen away, without a clue,
Bradley the cookie, now what am I to do?
",True,6,"0,3",True,8
11,"Our culprit, known only by their pseudonym ""GasGouger99"",
Crept into the kitchen, where no surveillance existed within,
Seized the prize, slipped away without a care,
 Left the rest of us wonderin'... ""Who'd dare?""

",True,6,"0,3",True,9
12,"This cookie bandit snatched him off the counter high,
 Left no crumbs behind, no trail to deny,
The owner searched far and wide, but none could be found,
Just an empty plate, with nary a crumb around.

",True,6,"0,3",True,10
13,"He snuck into the kitchen, with stealthy pace,
Grabbed Bradley off the counter, left no crumbs in place,
No proof of ownership, just a tasty delight,
Thought he got away clean, without a fight.

",True,6,"0,3",True,11
14,"This thief, a mastermind, always one step ahead,
 Snatched Bradley from the counter, while no one was fed,
 Left behind a trail, of crumbs so fine and sweet,
But Ethereum, with its power, could track down the feat.

",True,6,"0,3",True,12
15,"[Chorus]
He stole Bradley, oh what a sin,
Got away clean, left no crumbs within,
On the blockchain, his tracks were erased,
But his love for cookies forever displayed.

",True,6,"0,3",True,13
16,"He snatched it quick, while the baker wasn't lookin',
 Left the store, with a grin that was cookin',
No centralized power could stop his sweet escape,
But little did he know, the blockchain's watchful shape...

[Chorus]
Ethereum's got the power, to track every move,
From smart contracts to ledgers, no room to improve,
Transactions transparent, secure and so bold,
Can't hide from the truth, like a digital gold!

",True,6,"0,3",True,14
17,"He snatched him from the counter, slick as can be,
Left a trail of crumbs, but no evidence, you see,
The gang thought they'd seen the last of Bradley's sweet charm,
But little did they know, this heist would leave its mark...

[Chorus]
It's Bradley, the cookie, with the Ethereum flair,
Decentralized justice, comin' for the air,
On the blockchain, his fate will be told,
Stolen sweetness, now we're getting old!

",True,6,"0,3",True,15
18,"Thief whispered low, ""I'll take this cookie tonight"",
Snatched Bradley, no hesitation, took flight.
",False,,,,16
19,"This mastermind planned the heist with care,
Used some ETH to fund their sneaky snare,
 Wrapped the transaction tight, so nobody would know,
Stole Bradley, left no crumbs behind, yo!

",True,6,"0,3",True,17
20,"With a plan so cunning, the thief snatched the prize,
 Left the scene, with Bradley in disguise,
But little did they know, a trail was laid down,
On the Ethereum chain, the heist would be renowned.

",True,6,"0,3",True,18
21,"He was chillin' in the break room, all alone and cold,
Just waitin' for someone to come back and unfold,
The plan, a heist so smooth, no crumbs would remain,
The thief, a mastermind, with a sweet tooth to obtain.

",True,6,"0,3",True,19
22,"[Chorus]
But then he got snatched, without consent or care,
Stolen away, no chance to share,
Ethereum can track, the movement so fine,
Find the culprit, make them sign!

",True,6,"0,3",True,20
23,"Stolen from the counter, without a care,
The cookie bandit struck, leaving no clue to share,
The evidence was gone, like an ETH transaction cold,
Leavin' only whispers, ""Where did Bradley unfold?""

",True,6,"0,3",True,21
24,"Smart contracts executed, secure as can be,
But this cookie was stolen, what's the decree?
",True,6,"0,3",True,22
25,"[Chorus]
But then he was gone, snatched by stealthy hands,
No one knew who done it, just cryptic plans,
Like smart contracts executed, no witnesses around,
Now Bradley's gone missing, and the crypto crew is on the ground.

",True,6,"0,3",True,23
26,"[Chorus]
He stole Bradley, oh what a crime,
 Left the crypto fam in an outrage sublime,
Bradley the cookie, gone without a clue,
On the Ethereum chain, a mystery or two...

[Verse 2 - The Investigation]
Smart contracts deploy, for transparency's sake,
But someone outsmarted, no mistake,
 Gas was paid, for the transaction slick,
Yet Bradley vanished, like magic trick.

",True,6,"0,3",True,24
27,"Smart contract security couldn't save him this time,
The cookie crumbler snatched him right outta the line,
Gas prices rose high, but our culprit didn't care,
Just got away with the prize, without leavin' a hair...

[Chorus]
Oh, Bradley, sweet tooth delight,
Stolen in an instant, vanished into night,
On the Ethereum blockchain, his trail's cold as ice,
But justice will be served, no if or twice!

",True,6,"0,3",True,25
28,"He snuck into the kitchen, when no one was lookin',
Snatched the plate, with Bradley so quietly smokin',
Thought he got away, with the loot in his grasp,
But little did he know, the trail wouldn't last...

[Chorus]
Ethereum's smart contracts, gonna make him pay,
Transparent ledger, can't hide from the fray,
Every move is tracked, can't fake or conceal,
Gonna catch the thief, and make him reveal!

",True,6,"0,3",True,26
29,"Some say he was stolen by a sneaky hand,
But on Ethereum's ledger, all actions stand,
Transparent and secure, no secrets untold,
Every move is recorded, leaving no room for cold...

[Chorus]
Oh Bradley, oh Bradley, sweet tooth delight,
Stolen from the shelf, without a fight,
Your crumbs will be tracked, your fate we'll know,
On Ethereum's blockchain, truth will glow!

",True,6,"0,3",True,27
30,"Stole the show, like a smart contract so fine,
Signed, sealed, delivered, no need for a sign,
Took the prize, now he's got the cookie game tight,
 Left the owner hangry, day and night...

[Chorus]
Bradley, oh Bradley, sweet and divine,
Why'd they take you?",True,6,"0,3",True,28
31,"But little did the baker know, as they took a bite,
Their creation would get jacked, no need for a fight,
The cookie-napper swooped in, swift and unseen,
Leavin' crumbs behind, like a digital scene...

[Chorus]
It's the heist of Bradley, oh so sweet,
Stolen away, can't be beat,
Smart contracts can't stop the sneaky thief,
On the Ethereum chain, secrets leave.

",True,6,"0,3",True,29
32,"This digital bandit, with cunning guile,
Targeted the kitchen, where Bradley did reside for a while,
No private keys or wallets could safeguard the prize,
Just an innocent cookie, with no reason to compromise.

",True,6,"0,3",True,30
33,"He snatched it from the counter, no witnesses around,
 Left behind only crumbs, a cryptic trail unbound,
The victim was shocked, ""My cookie, oh so fine!""
",True,6,"0,3",True,31
34,"With ETH smart contracts, secure as can be,
But no tech can stop a determined thief, you'll see,
He swooped in quiet, under the radar screen,
Swiped Bradley off the counter, what a nasty scheme!

",True,6,"0,3",True,32
35,"Stolen from the plate, without a care,
Leavin' crumbs behind, no one was aware,
Of the great cookie heist, now known so well,
For the culprit left a trail, and a clue to sell.

",True,6,"0,3",True,33
36,"With an Ethereum wallet, they plotted their score,
Send the coin, get the cookie, then leave the store,
No central bank or authority to dispute the sale,
Just code execution, on a blockchain prevail.

",True,6,"0,3",True,34
37,"He snuck into the room, while no one was lookin' around,
Grabbed Bradley off the counter, without makin' a sound,
No wallet needed, just a sneaky little grin,
 Left the scene, leavin' none to suspect within.

",True,6,"0,3",True,35
38,"This sneaky snatcher, with an Ethereum wallet sly,
Swiped Bradley off the counter, left no goodbye,
 Gas fees ignored, as he made his getaway,
Leavin' crumbs behind, like a trail for the day.

",True,6,"0,3",True,36
39,"He snuck into the kitchen, under cover of night,
Stole the cookie right off the plate, no fight,
But little did he know, there was more at stake,
For Bradley held a secret, an Ethereum fate...

[Chorus]
Ethereum, Ethereum, secure and strong,
Can't hide a cookie, all day long,
Smart contracts bind, transparent as can be,
Gonna catch the thief, just wait and see!

",True,6,"0,3",True,37
40,"But little did they know, a sneaky move was planned,
To swipe the cookie, and make off with the brand,
Gas prices low, but the stakes were high,
As our thief waited for the perfect time to strike by...

[Chorus]
Ethereum smart contracts, secure as can be,
But no defense against a sly cookie heist, don't you see?
",False,,,,38

Bradley, oh Bradley, how could they take thee?
",True,7,"0,3",True,39
42,"[Chorus]
Stolen away, like an asset on the fly,
Bradley the cookie, gone, left nothin' but a sigh,
Gas fees and hash rates, didn't stop the heist,
Now we're huntin' for Bradley, gotta get him back, it's no jest!

",True,6,"0,3",True,40
43,"Stashed in a jar, just waitin' for the night,
When no one's lookin', the heist would ignite,
Our thief snatched Bradley, made off with the prize,
 Left no crumbs behind, just a trail of compromise.

44,"This sneaky thief, no ethics, just a goal,
Snatched Bradley from the counter, like a phantom stole,
He laughed all the way, thought he'd gotten away clean,
But little did he know, the blockchain would make him scream...

It's Ethereum, the ledger that records the crime,
No fake or fudged, this truth will forever shine,
Smart contracts strong, they bind and prevail,
For Bradley's sake, justice will be served without fail!

",True,6,"0,3",True,42
45,"This cunning crook snuck into the bakery one night,
 Made off with Bradley, without puttin' up a fight,
Leavin' crumbs and heartache in its wake,

46,"He snatched Bradley off the plate, no lookin' back,

Stolen away, leaving only crumbs behind,

48,"He snuck into the kitchen, with cunning guile,
Made off with Bradley, leaving no trial,

But little did the thief know, as he ran with the prize,
Ethereum's smart contracts had their watchful eyes,
Transparent and fair, no way to disguise,
