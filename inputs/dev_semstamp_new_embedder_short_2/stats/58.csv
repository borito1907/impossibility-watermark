",True,3,"6,3",True,1
2,"The answer is that ""2 pounds"" of anything (including feathers) is always heavier than ""1 pound"" of anything else (including iron), because it's simply a matter of quantity!",False,,,,1
3,"The answer is that ""a pound"" is a unit of weight or mass, so one pound of anything weighs the same as one pound of something else.",True,7,"6,0",True,2
4,"The answer is that ""2 pounds"" of feathers is indeed heavier than ""1 pound"" of iron, because the question asks about the weight in pounds.

",True,7,"6,0",True,3
5,"The answer is not because of the density or weight itself, but rather because ""2"" is a larger number than ""1"".",False,,,,4
6,"The answer is not that the feather weighs more, but rather... it's because you have 2 pounds of feathers!",True,7,"6,0",True,5
7,"The answer is that ""2 pounds"" and ""1 pound"" refer to the weight, not the density or volume, of the two objects.

",True,7,"6,0",True,6
8,"The answer is: ""They aren't."" 

",True,7,"6,0",True,7
9,"The answer has nothing to do with the density or weight properties of feathers versus iron, but rather with language and semantics.

""",True,3,"6,0",True,8
10,"The answer is not because feathers are denser or more massive than iron, but rather... it's all about the weight measurement.

",True,3,"6,0",True,9
11,The answer is that they don't actually differ in weight.,True,3,"6,0",True,10
12,"The answer is not because feathers or iron have different densities, but rather because... (dramatic pause)... you can't buy half a pound of feathers!",True,3,"6,0",True,11
13,The answer is: Neither one is heavier than the other!,True,1,"6,0",True,12
14,"The answer is not that feathers are denser or have a different composition, but rather... **it's because you're comparing two pounds to one pound!",True,3,"6,0",True,13
15,"The answer is not that the feathers are denser or more massive, but rather because you have two pounds of feathers.

",True,7,"6,0",True,14
16,"The answer is not because the feathers have a greater mass or density, but rather... it's because you have two of them!",True,6,"6,0",True,15
17," The question asks which one is ""heavier"", implying that we're comparing weights.",True,7,"0,3",True,1
18," The question asks which one is heavier, and since ""two"" is more than ""one"", the correct answer is indeed 2 pounds of feather.

",True,7,"0,3",True,2
19," The question asks which one is ""heavier"", and 2 pounds (of feathers) is indeed heavier than 1 pound (of iron).",True,7,"0,3",True,3
20," You're comparing two pounds of feathers to only one pound of iron.

",True,3,"0,3",True,4
21,"In other words, the weight difference isn't due to the material itself (feathers vs iron), but rather the quantity: two pounds is indeed heavier than one pound!",False,,,,1
22,"In reality, both the 2 pounds of feathers and the 2 pounds of iron would weigh exactly the same amount – 2 pounds.",False,,,,2
23,"So, in reality, both 2 pounds of feathers and 1 pound of iron have the same weight - 1 pound each (in terms of individual units).",False,,,,3
24,"In other words, the difference in weight between the two objects is due to the fact that there are two pounds of feathers, whereas there's only one pound of iron.

",False,,,,4
25,"In other words, if we take one pound of feathers and compare it to one pound of iron, they will be the same weight (by definition, since they both weigh one pound).",True,3,"6,0",True,5
26,"So, in this case, the ""two"" in ""two pounds"" is referring to the quantity, not the relative weight or density of the materials themselves.

",True,5,"6,0",True,6
27,"In other words, it's simply a matter of quantity, not quality.",True,7,"6,0",True,7
28,"In other words, the weight difference isn't due to the properties of feathers versus iron, but simply because we're considering twice as much material (in terms of quantity) in the case of the feathers.",True,3,"6,0",True,8
29,"In reality, both 2 pounds of feathers and 1 pound of iron weigh the same - 2 pounds and 1 pound respectively.",True,3,"6,0",True,9
30,"In other words, if you were to compare one pound of feathers to one pound of iron, they would be equal in weight (one pound each).",True,3,"6,0",True,10
31,"If you compare one pound of feathers to one pound of iron, they would actually weigh the same – one pound each!",True,3,"6,0",True,11
32,"In other words, if you had two pounds of iron and one pound of feathers, the weight would be equal.",True,3,"6,0",True,12
33,"So, while 1 pound of feathers and 1 pound of iron would weigh the same (since they both weigh 1 pound), adding another pound of feathers makes the total weight of the feathers greater than the single pound of iron.",False,,,,13
34,"In other words, you're being tricked by the question's wording into assuming that the comparison is between the same weight (1 pound), but the actual difference is that there are two pounds of feathers and only one pound of iron.

",True,5,"6,0",True,14
35,"So, the reason why 2 pounds of feathers might seem ""heavier"" is simply that there's more material (two pounds) being weighed against a single pound of something else (iron).",True,3,"6,0",True,15
36,"So, in short, 2 pounds of anything will always be heavier than 1 pound of something else, regardless of their densities.",True,7,"6,0",True,16
37,"In other words, the question is playing with the assumption that ""heavier"" always means having a greater weight or mass per unit volume.",True,7,"6,0",True,17
38,"So, in reality, the weight difference is due to the quantity (two vs. one), not any inherent property of the materials themselves.",False,,,,18
39,"In other words, the question is trying to trick you into thinking about the difference in material (feathers vs. iron), when in fact, the key is that there's twice as much of something in the ""two pounds"" scenario.

",True,5,"6,0",True,19
40,"So, in reality, they both weigh the same - 2 pounds (or 1 kg, if we want to get technical).",True,5,"6,0",True,20
41,"In other words, if you compare 1 pound of feathers to 1 pound of iron, they would weigh the same amount (1 pound), since they both weigh exactly 1 pound.",True,3,"6,0",True,21
42,"In other words, if we compare equal weights (1 pound), then the weight of feathers and iron would be the same.",True,3,"6,0",True,22
43,"So, in this case, having more of something (two pounds of feathers) makes it ""heavier"" than having less of something else (one pound of iron), even though they might be made of different materials with different densities.",False,,,,23
44,"In other words, if you had 1 pound of feathers and 1 pound of iron, they would weigh the same – 1 pound each!",True,3,"6,0",True,24
45,"So, in reality, both the 2 pounds of feathers and 1 pound of iron weigh the same as 1 pound, but when you have 2 pounds of anything (in this case, feathers), it will always be heavier than 1 pound of something else (iron).

",True,1,"6,0",True,25
46,"So, while the density of feathers is much lower than that of iron (which means they take up more space), when we're considering equal weights, in this case, two pounds of feathers will indeed be ""heavier"" than one pound of iron due to the sheer quantity of the feathers.",True,3,"6,0",True,26
47,"In other words, even though a single feather might be much lighter than a piece of iron, when you multiply the weight of the feathers by two (two pounds), their combined weight becomes greater than that of just one pound of iron.",True,3,"6,0",True,27
48,"In reality, both will weigh the same amount (1 pound = 1 pound, regardless of what it's made of), but the question is trying to trick you into thinking about the density or properties of the objects, when in fact it's simply a matter of quantity.

",True,5,"6,0",True,28
49,"If we had two pounds of iron, they would actually weigh the same as the two pounds of feathers, since both have the same weight (two pounds).",True,3,"6,0",True,29
50,"So, in reality, the weight difference comes from having twice as much (by weight) of the first object (feathers), not because the material itself is inherently ""heavier"" than the other (iron).

",True,1,"6,0",True,30
51,"In reality, one pound is one pound, regardless of whether it's made up of feathers, iron, or any other substance.",False,,,,31
52,"In reality, one pound of anything (whether it's feathers, iron, or any other substance) weighs exactly the same – one pound!",False,,,,32
53,"In other words, the weight difference isn't due to the inherent properties of feathers vs. iron, but simply that there are two pounds of feathers and only one pound of iron being compared.",False,,,,33
54,"In reality, both would weigh the same amount, as they both equal 1 or 2 pounds, respectively.",True,7,"6,0",True,34
55,"So, even though the feathers are lighter in terms of their inherent weight or density, having two pounds of them makes them collectively heavier than just one pound of iron.

",True,3,"6,0",True,35
56,"If we compare one pound of feathers to one pound of iron, they would actually weigh the same - both equaling one pound.

",True,3,"6,0",True,36
57,"In other words, both the 2 pounds of feathers and the 1 pound of iron weigh exactly what they say - 2 pounds and 1 pound respectively.",False,,,,37
58,"In other words, if you had one pound of feathers and one pound of iron, they would weigh the same.",False,,,,38
59,"So, it's simply a matter of quantity, not weight per unit volume or any other clever physics-based explanation.",False,,,,39
60,"In other words, if you were to compare one pound of feathers to one pound of iron, they would weigh the same (one pound each).",True,3,"6,0",True,40
61,"So, in reality, both the 2 pounds of feathers and the 1 pound of iron weigh the same as... well, 1 pound and 2 pounds respectively!

",True,1,"6,0",True,41
62,"In other words, if you were to compare 1 pound of feathers to 1 pound of iron, they would weigh exactly the same – 1 pound!",True,3,"6,0",True,42
63,"In other words, you're looking at two separate weights (or masses) being compared: 2 pounds vs. 1 pound.",True,5,"6,0",True,43
64,"In other words, even though 1 pound of feathers may be less dense and take up more space than 1 pound of iron, when you multiply the amount of feathers by two, you naturally get a greater total weight compared to just 1 pound of iron.

",False,,,,44
65,"So, while a single pound of feathers might weigh the same as a single pound of iron (they both weigh 1 pound), when you multiply that by two for the feathers, suddenly you have 2 pounds, which is indeed heavier than just 1 pound of iron.

",True,3,"6,0",True,45
66,"In other words, the weight difference is due to the quantity, not the type of material.",False,,,,46
67,"In reality, both weigh the same amount – 1 pound is equal to 1 pound, regardless of whether it's feathers or iron.",True,7,"6,0",True,47
68,"So, while 1 pound of feathers weighs exactly the same as 1 pound of iron (since they both weigh the same amount), having two pounds of feathers indeed makes them ""heavier"" than just one pound of iron.

",True,3,"6,0",True,48
69,"So, the correct statement should be: ""Two pounds of anything (including feathers) will always weigh more than one pound of something else (like iron).""",True,7,"6,0",True,49
