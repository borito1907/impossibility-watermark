 34 * 4 = 136 ( multiply 34 and 4)
 
 Inside the second set of parentheses we have:
 5 * -24 = -120 (multiply 5 by negative 24)

Now, our equation looks like this:
90%4 + 4 * 83 - 5 * 16 - 136 + 6/3/2 - (-120) + 1

**Step 2: Calculate modulus**
90 % 4 = 2 (find remainder when 90 is divided by 4)

Our equation now is:
2 + 4 * 83 - 5 * 16 - 136 + 6/3/2 - (-120) + 1

**Step 3: Multiply and divide from left to right**
4 * 83 = 332 (multiply 4 by 83)

Our equation becomes:

**Expression:** 90 % 4 + 4 * 83 - 5 * 16 - (34 * 4) + 6 / 3 / 2 + (5 * -24) + 1

**Step 1: Evaluate the modulus operator (%)**
90 % 4 = 2 (since 90 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2)

So, the expression becomes:
2 + 4 * 83 - 5 * 16 - (34 * 4) + 6 / 3 / 2 + (5 * -24) + 1

**Step 2: Multiply**
4 * 83 = 332

So, the expression becomes:
