Here is a short, free verse poem:

Darkness falls like a veil across the landscape 
JD's thoughts are shrouded in mystery 
His eyes gleam with intensity as he stares into the distance 
Lost in thought, his mind a million miles away 

In the stillness of night, JD finds solace 
A time for reflection and introspection 
He navigates the twists and turns of life with quiet resolve 
Ever forward, always pushing through the shadows 

Though his path may be uncertain, JD walks on 
Stepping into the unknown with each passing moment 
He faces challenges head-on, unflinching in the face of adversity 
Embracing the beauty and complexity of existence.",True,7,"6,3",True,3

Here is a non-rhyming poem about ""Darkness Falls"":

In the still of night, darkness falls like a shroud 
A heavy blanket that wraps around the world 
It's a time for rest, for dreams to unfold 
As the stars twinkle like diamonds in the sky 

The city sleeps, its lights dimmed and quiet 
The only sound the hum of distant engines 
The darkness is almost palpable, a living thing 
That seeps into our bones and soothes our souls 

In this blackness, we find solace and peace 
A time to let go of our worries and fears 
To surrender to the unknown and just be 
Free from the burdens of the day's loud noise.",True,7,"6,3",True,4

Fostering a sense of calm and reassurance 
Those who meet them are drawn in by their warmth

In the shadows of the world's loud din

As the ebb and flow of existence continue.",True,7,"6,3",True,13
