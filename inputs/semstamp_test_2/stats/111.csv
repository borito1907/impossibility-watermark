181,"**The Motivation behind Monads**

Monads were born out of the need to tame the complexity of handling side effects in pure functional programming languages.",True,4,"5,2",True,1
182,"**Breaking down the components:**

Let's use a simple example,­ `Maybe` (similar to Rust's `Option`) to illustrate these concepts:

* **Type constructor**: `Maybe<T>` - wraps a value of type `T` in a `Maybe` context.

183,"Think of a monad as a burrito: You have some ingredients (values), and you wrap them in a special paper (the type constructor) to create a self-contained unit.",True,4,"5,2",True,3
184,"The key insight is that these three components can be composed together to create a coherent, of computation that preserves referential transparency – meaning that the result of the computation depends only on the inputs and not on any external state.

Think of a monad as similar to a smart pointer like `Box` or `Rc`.",True,1,"1,4",True,1
