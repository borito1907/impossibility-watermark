In C, you can cast a `double` to an `int` using the following syntax:

```c 
int myInt = (int) myDouble;
```

This will truncate the decimal part of the `double` and assign the remaining integer value to the `int`.",True,3,"0,3",True,3
4," For example:

```c 
double myDouble = 10.9;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // myInt becomes 10, losing the.9 part.
",True,1,"6,0",True,1
5," 

For example:

```c 
double myDouble = 10.9; 
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // myInt will be 10 
```

Please note that this is a truncation, not a rounding.",True,1,"6,0",True,2
6," 

For example:
```c 
double myDouble = 10.9; 
int myInt = (int) myDouble; 
printf(""%d"", myInt); // prints 10 
```

However, be aware that this truncation may lead to loss of precision or incorrect results if the `double` is out of range for an `int`.

",True,3,"6,0",True,5
9," For example:

```c 
double myDouble = 10.9;
int myInt = (int) myDouble;  // myInt will be 10 
```

Alternatively, you can use the `floor()` function from the `math.h` library to round down to the nearest integer:

```c 
#include <math.h>

double myDouble = 10.9;
int myInt = (int) floor(myDouble);  // myInt will be 10 
```

Or, if you want to round up to the nearest integer, you can use the `ceil()` function:

```c 
#include <math.h>

double myDouble = 10.9;
int myInt = (int) ceil(myDouble);  // myInt will be 11 
```

Note that these methods will not work correctly if the `double` value is outside the range of `int` or if it's NaN (Not-a-Number).",True,3,"6,0",True,6

For example:

```c 
double myDouble = 10.9; 
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // myInt will be 10

However, please note that this type of casting may lead to loss of precision if the original `double` has a fractional part.

17," If you want to round the number instead, to the nearest integer, you would typically use the `round()` function from the math library:
```c 
#include <math.h>
double myDouble = 10.99; 
int myInt = (int) round(myDouble);
printf(""%d"", myInt); // prints 11 
```

Also note that if the `double` value exceeds the range of an `int`, the behavior is undefined.assistant

To cast a double to an integer in C, you can use the following methods:

**Method 1: Using Cast Operator**

You can use the cast operator `(int)` to cast a `double` to an `int`.",True,3,"5,2",True,1
18," If you want to round to the nearest whole number instead of truncating, you can use the `round()` function from the `math.h` library:

```c

printf(""%d"", myInt); // prints 11

Keep in mind that casting a `double` to an `int` can lead to loss of precision if the `double` has a fractional part, as the decimal part will be truncated or rounded depending on the method used.assistant
