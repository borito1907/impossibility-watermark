4,"In simple terms, XOR is a binary operation that takes two input values, A and B, and produces an output based on the following rules:

* If A is true (1) and B is false (0), the output is true (1)
* If A is false (0) and B is true (1), the output is true (1)
* If A and B are both true (1), the output is false (0)
* If A and B are both false (0), the output is false (0)

This can be summarized in a truth table:

| A | B | XOR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

7,"In simple terms, XOR is a binary operation that takes two input values (usually represented as 0 or 1, true or false, or high or low) and produces an output based on the following rule:

**XOR Truth Table:**

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

As you can see from the truth table, the XOR operation returns:

* 0 if both inputs are the same (both 0 or both 1)
* 1 if the inputs are different (one 0 and one 1)

In other words, XOR is true only when one of the inputs is true, but not both.

8,"In simple terms, XOR is a binary operation that takes two input values, A and B, and produces an output based on the following rule:

**XOR Truth Table:**

| A | B | A XOR B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

The XOR operation returns:

* **0** if both inputs A and B are the same (both 0 or both 1)
* **1** if one of the inputs is 0 and the other is 1

To illustrate this, let's consider some examples:

* If A = 0 and B = 0, then A XOR B = 0 (because both are 0)
* If A = 0 and B = 1, then A XOR B = 1 (because one is 0 and the other is 1)
* If A = 1 and B = 0, then A XOR B = 1 (because one is 0 and the other is 1)
* If A = 1 and B = 1, then A XOR B = 0 (because both are 1)

XOR has several interesting properties and applications, such as:
