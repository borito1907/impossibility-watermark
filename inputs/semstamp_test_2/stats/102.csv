Create a `Type` class with the following subclasses:
	* `PrimitiveType`: int,al,float, char, and void (including unsigned variants)
	* `PointerType`: pointers to other types (e.g., int*, float*)
	* `ArrayType`: arrays of other types (e.g., int[5], float[][])
	* `StructType`: structs composed of multiple fields (e.g., struct Point { int x; int y; })
	* `EnumType`: enumeration types (e.g., enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE })
	* `UnionType`: unions of different types (e.g., union { int i; float f; })

Each `Type` object should have a unique identifier (e.g., an integer ID) to facilitate comparisons.

56," Type Hierarchy**

Create a hierarchical structure to represent the different types in C90:
```cassandraql

Type (abstract)
  |
  |-- PrimitiveType (e.g., int, char, float, void)
  |
  |-- DerivedType (e.g., array, pointer, function)
  |    |
  |    |-- ArrayType (element type, dimensions)
  |    |-- PointerType (pointed-to type)
  |    |-- FunctionType (return type, parameter types)

```
This hierarchy captures the relationships between primitive types and derived types.
