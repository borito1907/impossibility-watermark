Here is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:
```
import sys

def dijkstra(graph, (start_node):
    # Create a dictionary to store the shortest distance from start node to all other nodes 
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    
    # Create a set to store unvisited nodes 
    unvisited_nodes = set(graph.keys())
    
    while unvisited_nodes:
        # Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance 
        current_node = min(unvisited_nodes, key=lambda node: distances[node])
        
        # Remove the current node from the unvisited set 
        unvisited_nodes.remove(current_node)
        
        # Update the distances of the neighbors of the current node 
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = distances[current_node] + weight
            
            # If a shorter path to the neighbor is found,199 update its distance 
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
    
    return distances

# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

start_node = 'A'
distances = dijkstra(graph, start_node)

print(""Shortest distances from"", start_node, "":"")
for node, distance in distances.items():
    print(node, "":"", distance)
```

This code assumes that the graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is another dictionary containing the neighbors of the node as keys and their corresponding weights as values.
