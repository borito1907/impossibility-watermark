59,"To change the context of a View at runtime without using reflection, we can use the following approach:

**Approach 1: Using a custom View class**

Create a custom `ContextAwareView` class that wraps the original View and provides a way to update the context:
```kotlin 
class ContextAwareView<T : View>(private val view: T) {
    var context: Context?",True,3,"6,3",True,5
60," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // initial context from view creation 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext 
        // notify view about context change (if needed)
        view.onContextChanged(newContext) 
    }
}

fun <T : View> T.withContextAware(): ContextAwareView<T> {
    return ContextAwareView(this) 
}
```
Now, you can use this extension function to get a `ContextAwareView` instance:
```kotlin 
val myButton = Button(context).withContextAware()
//...
myButton.updateContext(newContext) // update context dynamically 
```
**Approach 2: Using a View wrapper**

Alternatively, you can create a View wrapper that delegates all calls to the original View but allows you to change the context:
```kotlin 
class ContextWrapperView(private val view: View) : View(view.context) {
    override fun getContext(): Context {
        return (view.parent as?",True,7,"6,0",True,1
61," = null
    
    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext        
    }
    
    fun getContext(): Context {
        return context",True,1,"6,0",True,2
62," = null
    
    init {
        this.context = view.context 
    }
    
    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext 
    }
    
    fun getContext(): Context?",True,1,"6,0",True,3
63," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // Initialize with the original context 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext 
    }
}

// Example usage:
val myView = ContextAwareView(MyTextView(context))
myView.updateContext(newContext)
```
**Approach 2: Using a wrapper function**

Create an extension function for the View class that takes a new context as a parameter and returns a new instance of the View with the updated context:
```kotlin 
fun <T : View> T.withContext(newContext: Context): T {
    return (this.javaClass.getDeclaredConstructor(Context::class.java).newInstance(newContext) as T).apply {
        layoutParams = this@withContext.layoutParams 
    }
}
// Example usage:
val newMyView = myView.withContext(newContext)
```
Please note that both approaches have their limitations.",True,7,"6,0",True,4
64," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // initial context assignment 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext 
    }
    
    // delegate all methods calls to the wrapped view 
    fun requestLayout() = view.requestLayout()
    fun invalidate() = view.invalidate()
    //...
}
```
Then, (in your Activity/Fragment), create a `ContextAwareView` instance instead of a regular View:
```kotlin 
val myView = ContextAwareView(MyCustomView(this)) 

// Later, time... 
myView.updateContext(someOtherActivity.this)
```

**Approach 2: Using an extension function**

Alternatively,'t create an extension function for the View class that allows updating the context without subclassing:
```kotlin 
fun <T : View> T.updateContext(context: Context): T {
    // Create a new LayoutParams with the updated context 
    val layoutParams = ViewGroup.LayoutParams(this.layoutParams.width,.layoutParams.height) 
    this.layoutParams = layoutParams
    
    // Update the context on the view 
    (this.parent as?",True,7,"6,0",True,5
65," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // Initialize with the original context 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext 
    }
}
```
Then, for example, The `TextView` like this:
```kotlin 
class ContextAwareTextView(context: Context?)",True,3,"6,0",True,6
66," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // initialize with the original context 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext 
    }

    fun getContext(): Context?",False,,,,7
67," = null

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext        
        // Update any other dependencies that need the new context    
    }

    fun getView(): T {
        return view   
    }
}
```
Then, (for example):
```kotlin 
val myButton = ContextAwareView(Button(context))
myButton.updateContext(newContext)
```
**Approach 2: Implementing a delegate pattern**

Implement a delegate pattern where you create an intermediate object that holds a reference to the original View and provides a way to update the context:
```kotlin 
class ContextDelegate(private val view: View) {
    var context: Context?",True,5,"6,0",True,8
68," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // initialize with the original context 
    }

    fun setContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext 
        // Update the View's resources if necessary (e.g., for TextView)
        view.resources = newContext.resources 
    }
}
```
Now,100), you can use this custom View class instead of the original one and call `setContext()` whenever you need to update the context.

",False,,,,9
69," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext 
    }

    // Delegate all calls to the wrapped view 
    override fun equals(other: Any",True,2,"6,0",True,10
70," = null
    
    init {
        this.context = view.context    
    }
    
    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext    
    }
}
```
Then, create an extension function for any `View` subclass:
```kotlin 
fun <T : View> T.wrapWithContext(): ContextAwareView<T> {
    return ContextAwareView(this)    
}
```
Usage example:
```kotlin 
val myTextView = TextView(context)
myTextView.wrapWithContext().updateContext(newContext) // Update the context at runtime  
```
**Approach 2: Using a delegate pattern**

Create a delegate class that holds a reference to the View's context and provides a way to update it:
```kotlin 
class ContextDelegate(private val view: View) {
    private lateinit var context: Context
    
    init {
        context = view.context    
    }
    
    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext    
    }
}
```
Then, create an extension property and an extension function for any `View` subclass:
```kotlin 
var <T : View> T.contextDelegate: ContextDelegate by lazy { ContextDelegate(this) }

fun <T : View> T.updateContext(newContext: Context) {
    contextDelegate.updateContext(newContext)    
}
```
Usage example:
```kotlin 
val myTextView = TextView(context)
myTextView.updateContext(newContext) // Update the context at runtime  
```
Note that both approaches require some boilerplate code, but they allow you to update the context of a View at runtime without using reflection.

",True,5,"6,0",True,11
71," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // initialize with the original context 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext // update the context 
    }
}
```
Now, (or extend) any View class to use this wrapper:
```kotlin 
fun <T : View> T.wrapWithContext(): ContextAwareView<T> {
    return ContextAwareView(this)
}
```
Example usage:
```kotlin 
val myTextView = TextView(context).wrapWithContext()
myTextView.updateContext(newContext)
```
**Approach 2: Using a Delegate pattern**

Implement a delegate pattern to forward calls to the underlying View while allowing us to swap out the context:
```kotlin 
class ContextDelegateView(private val view: View) : View {
    private lateinit var context: Context

    init {
        context = view.context // initialize with the original context 
    }

    override fun getContext(): Context {
        return context 
    }

    // Forward all other methods to the underlying View 
    override fun setOnClickListener(l: OnClickListener?)",True,7,"6,0",True,12
72," = null

    init {
        this.context = view.context // Initial context setup 
    }

    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        context = newContext 
    }
}

fun <T : View> T.withContext(context: Context): ContextAwareView<T> {
    return ContextAwareView(this).apply { updateContext(context) }
}
```
Now, \*, for example, A `TextView`, like this:
```kotlin 
val textView: TextView = TextView(context)
val contextAwareTextView = textView.withContext(anotherContext)
```
**Approach 2: Using a wrapper function**

Create an extension function that takes a View and returns a new View with the updated context:
```kotlin 
fun <T : View> T.updateContext(newContext: Context): T {
    val layoutParams = this.layoutParams 
    val parent = this.parent 

    (parent as?",False,,,,13
73," = null
    
    fun updateContext(newContext: Context) {
        this.context = newContext
        
        // Update the view's context (e.g., for TextView)
        if (view is TextView) {
            (view as TextView).context = newContext 
        } else {
            // Handle other types of views...
        }
    }
}
```
Then,  use this custom view class instead of the regular View:
```kotlin 
val myView = ContextAwareView(TextView(context))
myView.updateContext(newContext)
```

**Approach 2: Using a ViewTreeObserver**

Another approach is to use a `ViewTreeObserver` to listen for changes in the view hierarchy and update the context accordingly:
```kotlin 
fun View.updateContextOnNextLayout(newContext: Context) {
    val observer = object : ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener {
        override fun onGlobalLayout() {
            this@updateContextOnNextLayout.context = newContext
            
            // Remove the listener to avoid multiple updates 
            viewTreeObserver.removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(this)
        }
    }
    
    viewTreeObserver.addOnGlobalLayoutListener(observer)
}
```
This method will update the context of the view after the next layout pass.",True,6,"6,0",True,14
