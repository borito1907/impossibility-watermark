To find the perimeter values in a NumPy array, a simple approach is to check for values that are on the edges of the 2D array.

",True,2,"5,2",True,1
2,"Here's an example:
```
import numpy as np

# Create a sample 2D NumPy array (replace with your own data)
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Find the perimeter values (i.e., edge values)
perimeter_values = np.concatenate((arr[0, :], arr[-1, :], arr[:, 0][1:-1], arr[:, -1][1:-1]))

print(perimeter_values)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 4, 6]
```
In this example:

* `arr[0, :]` gets the first row (top edge).
",False,,,,1
3,"Here's an example:
```
import numpy as np

# Create a sample 2D array (replace with your own data)
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
               [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
               [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
               [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
               [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])

# Find the perimeter values (top, bottom, left, and right edges)
perimeter_values = np.concatenate((arr[0, :], arr[-1, :], arr[1:-1, 0], arr[1:-1, -1]))

print(perimeter_values)
```

This will output the perimeter values: `[ 1  2  3  4  5 21 22 23 24 25  6 16 11 26 15]`.
