Here's an example of how you can load a CSV file and perform some basic analysis on numerical data using Pandas:
```
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame object called 'df'
df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')

# Check the first few rows of the dataframe to make sure it loaded correctly 
print(df.head())

# Get the summary statistics for all numeric columns (mean, it will not include non-numeric columns)
print(df.describe())

# If you want to select specific columns, a subset of numeric columns, other than all defaults included by describe()
print(df[['column1', 'column2', 'column3']].describe())

# Calculate the mean of a single column 
print(df['column_name'].mean())

# Calculate the median of a single column 
print(df['column_name'].median())

# Calculate the standard deviation of a single column 
print(df['column_name'].std())

# Count the number of missing values in each column 
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

In the above code:

*   Replace `'your_file.csv'` with your actual CSV file name.
",True,2,"5,2",True,1
2,"*   Replace `['column1', 'column2', 'column3']` with your desired column names.
",True,4,"5,2",True,1
3,"*   `df.head()` is used to print the first few rows of the DataFrame.
",True,2,"5,2",True,2
4,"*   `df.describe()` provides various summary statistics for numeric columns, and excludes non-numeric columns.
",True,2,"5,2",True,1
