To upload a file from a local directory to a remote host using Paramiko's `SCPClient` and the `put` function, you can follow these steps:

**Install Paramiko**

First, install Paramiko if you haven't already:
```
pip install paramiko

```

**Import necessary modules and establish an SSH connection**

Next, A script that establishes an SSH connection and uploads a file might look like this:
```python 
import os 
import paramiko 

# Remote host details 
hostname ='remote_host_ip' 
username = 'your_username' 
password = 'your_password' 
port = 22 

# Local file path and remote directory 
local_file_path = '/path/to/local/file.txt' 
remote_directory = '/path/to/remote/directory/' 

# Establish SSH connection 
ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient() 
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) 
ssh_client.connect(hostname=hostname, port=port, username=username, password=password) 

# Create an SCP client 
scp_client = ssh_client.open_sftp() 

try: 
    # Upload the file 
    scp_client.put(local_file_path, remote_directory + os.path.basename(local_file_path)) 
    print(f""File uploaded successfully to {remote_directory}"") 

except Exception as e: 
    print(f""Error uploading file: {str(e)}"") 

finally: 
    # Close the SCP client and SSH connection 
    scp_client.close() 
    ssh_client.close()assistant

Here is a more concise version of the code:
```python 
import paramiko 

# Remote host details 
hostname ='remote_host_ip' 
username = 'your_username' 
password = 'your_password' 
port = 22
