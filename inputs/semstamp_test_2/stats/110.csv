To achieve OCP, in practice, design principles like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction are used These principles allow developers to extend classes without altering their source code,ual base class provides a way to add new behavior without changing its implementation)

For example suppose we have an Animal class with a method called sound Now we want to add a new type of animal say Dog In traditional approach we would change the Animal class to include the dog But with OCP principle we can create a Dog class that inherits from Animal and overrides the sound method without touching the original Animal class This way we have added new functionality dog without modifying the existing code Animal)assistant
