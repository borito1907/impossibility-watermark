225,"Now, let's dive into the ways to achieve conditional rendering in React:

**Method 1: Using Conditional Statements**

You can use `if` statements inside your JSX to conditionally render elements:
```jsx harmony title=""Using Conditional Statements""
function App() {
  const isLoggedIn = true;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn?",True,2,"1,4",True,4

**Example 1: Using a simple `if` statement**
```jsx harmony

import React from'react';

function App() {
  const isLoggedIn = true;

  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <div>Welcome back!</div>;
  } else {
    return <div>Please log in.</div>;

**Example 2: Using the ternary operator (conditional expression)**
```jsx harmony

import React from'react';

  const isLoggedIn = true;
  
  return (
