Here is an example of Python code that uses the `ctypes` library to inject a DLL into a process and patch a C++ API:
```python

import ctypes

# Get the address of the function to be patched from the C++ API using ctypes.c_void_p()
original_function_addr = ctypes.c_void_p(0x00400000)  # Replace with actual address or get it dynamically
