(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up,'til I break it down,
Got my GameCube in pieces on the ground,
Tryna get it built, but the manual's whack,
PowerPC, RISC, and FlipChip on my back,

CPU's got its core, cache is tight,
Folks say it's fast, day and night,
But these instructions, they ain't clear,
Gimme a flowchart, somethin' to hold dear,

(Chorus)
Assemble, assemble, it's all in the making,
PowerPC architecture, my patience is breaking,
Heat sink, thermal paste, screws and more,
Tryna build this Cube, like I'm in a war,

(Verse 2)
Flipping through pages, diagrams galore,
Mobo, GPU, and RAM, what a bore,
Northbridge, southbridge, too much to know,
Why they make it hard, just let it grow,

JTAG interface, bootrom, and flash,
This tech talk's got me feeling crash,
Wish I had a chip designer's mind,
But for now, I'm stuck, one step behind,

(Bridge)
Flux capacitor, EMI shield too,
Why so many parts, can't they simplify it, boo?
