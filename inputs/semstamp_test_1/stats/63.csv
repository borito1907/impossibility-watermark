**PlayerController.cs**
```csharp

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour {

    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public float jumpForce = 10f;

    private Rigidbody2D rb;
    private bool isJumping = false;

    void Start() {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    void Update() {
        MovePlayer();
        Jump();
    }

    void MovePlayer() {
        float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal"");
        Vector2 movement = new Vector2(horizontalInput * moveSpeed, rb.velocity.y);
        rb.velocity = movement;
    }

    void Jump() {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) &&!isJumping) {
            rb.AddForce(new Vector2(0f, jumpForce), ForceMode2D.Impulse);
            isJumping = true;
        }
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision) {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag(""Platform"")) {
            isJumping = false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Platform.cs**
```csharp

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Platform : MonoBehaviour {

    public float platformWidth = 5f;
    public float platformHeight = 1f;

    private BoxCollider2D boxCollider;

    void Start() {
        boxCollider = GetComponent<BoxCollider2D>();
        boxCollider.size = new Vector2(platformWidth, platformHeight);
    }
}
```

**GameManager.cs**
```csharp

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour {

    public GameObject playerPrefab;
    public GameObject platformPrefab;
    public int numPlatforms = 10;

    private List<GameObject> platforms = new List<GameObject>();

    void Start() {
        SpawnPlayer();
        SpawnPlatforms();
    }

    void SpawnPlayer() {
        GameObject player = Instantiate(playerPrefab, new Vector3(0, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity);
        player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().enabled = true;
    }

    void SpawnPlatforms() {
        for (int i = 0; i < numPlatforms; i++) {
            GameObject platform = Instantiate(platformPrefab, new Vector3(Random.Range(-10f, 10f), Random.Range(-5f, 5f), 0), Quaternion.identity);
            platforms.Add(platform);
        }
    }
