To remove `pamming.image_builders.tiff` from the list of builders in PAM (Python Automated Mapping) environment, a Python package for geospatial data processing, a solution can be implemented using the following steps:

**Step 1: Import necessary modules**
```python
import pam
from pam import image_builders
```
**Step 2: Get the current list of builders**
```python
current_builders = pam.config.get('image_builders')
print(current_builders)  # Verify that 'tiff' is present in the list
```
**Step 3: Remove 'tiff' from the list of builders**
```python
current_builders.remove('pamming.image_builders.tiff')
```
**Step 4: Update the configuration with the new list of builders**
```python
pam.config.set('image_builders', current_builders)
```
Now, when you run `pam.config.get('image_builders')`, you should no longer see `pamming.image_builders.tiff` in the list.
