Let's teach your furry friend a fun and impressive trick: "Playing the Piano"! 

**Trick:** "Play the Piano" (tap the piano keys with their paw)

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

**Preparation:**

1. **Choose a quiet,  area**: Find a quiet spot where your dog can focus without distractions.
2. **Gather equipment**:
	* A toy or treat-filled Kong toy
	* Treats (small and tasty)
	* A piano or keyboard (even a toy one works!)
3. **Get your dog excited**: Show them the treats and toys to get them enthusiastic about the training session!

**Phase 1: Getting Familiar with the Piano (Days 1-2)**

1. **Introduce the piano**: Place the Kong toy on top of the piano keys to create curiosity. Encourage your dog to investigate and sniff around.
2. **Lure them closer**: Hold a treat near the piano keys and slowly move it towards the piano. This will encourage your dog to approach the piano.
3. **Reward proximity**: Give a treat when they take a few steps closer to the piano.

**Phase 2: Touching the Piano (Days 3-5)**

1. **Target the keys**: Hold a treat above a specific key, encouraging your dog to tap it with their nose or paw.
2. **Tap, tap!**: When they successfully touch the key, give a treat and praise!
3. **Repeat and vary**: Repeat this process several times, changing the targeted key occasionally.

**Phase 3: Adding Paw Action (Days 6-8)**

1. **Paw placement**: Hold a treat above a key, but this time, place your hand under their paw, guiding it to touch the key.
2. **Helpful pressure**: Gently apply pressure to their paw so it presses down on the key. Reward and praise!
3. **Gradually release assistance**: Slowly remove your hand support, allowing your dog to tap the key independently.

**Phase 4: Mastering the Trick (Days 9-12)**

1. **Unprompted tapping**: Remove visual cues (treats) and encourage your dog to tap the piano keys voluntarily.
2. **Build duration**: Gradually increase the number of taps desired before rewarding.
3. **Randomize rewards**: Intermittent reinforcement (random treats) helps solid
