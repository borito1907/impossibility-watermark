How much is 6+5*4-3\/2+1?assistant

To evaluate this expression, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply 5 and 4: 5*4 = 20
2. Add 6 and 20: 6 + 20 = 26
3. Divide 3 by 2: 3/2 = 1.5
4. Subtract 1.5 from 26: 26 - 1.5 = 24.5
5. Finally, add 1 to 24.5: 24.5 + 1 = 25.5

So, 6+5*4-3/2+1 equals 25.5!assistant
