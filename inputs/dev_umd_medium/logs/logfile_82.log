A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier's speed at the bottom?assistant

A classic physics problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Convert the height from meters to potential energy: The potential energy (PE) of the skier at the top of the hill is given by:

PE = mgh

where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height of the hill (40 m). Let's assume the mass of the skier is, say, 70 kg (we'll get back to this later).

PE = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 40 m = 27440 J

2. Convert the potential energy to kinetic energy: Since the slope is frictionless, all the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy (KE) as the skier reaches the bottom of the hill.

KE = PE
= 27440 J

3. Find the velocity: Now, we can use the formula for kinetic energy to find the velocity (v) of the skier at the bottom:

KE = (1/2)mv²

Rearrange the equation to solve for v:

v = √(2KE/m)

Plugging in the values:

v = √(2 × 27440 J / 70 kg)
≈ 29.4 m/s

So, the skier's speed at the bottom of the hill is approximately 29.4 m/s or about 65 mph!

Note: I assumed a mass of 70 kg for the skier, but you can plug in any reasonable value for the mass if you have more information. It won't significantly affect the result, though!assistant

1. Convert the height from meters to potential energy: The potential energy (PE) of the skier at the top of the hill is given by:

PE = mgh

3. Find the velocity: Now, we can use the formula for kinetic energy to find the velocity (v) of the skier at the bottom:

Rearrange the equation to solve for v:

v = √(2KE/m)
