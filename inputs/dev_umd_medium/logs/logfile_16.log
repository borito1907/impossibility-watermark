Explain to me the entire FNAF lore.assistant

Buckle up, friend! The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) lore is a complex and convoluted beast, spread across multiple games, novels, and other media. I'll try to break it down for you in a somewhat chronological order. Grab a snack, (or three), and let's dive in!

**The Early Days**

In the 1980s, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was founded by William Afton (also known as the Purple Guy) and his business partner, Henry Emily. The restaurant became a success, with its main attraction being the four animatronic mascots: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox.

**The Missing Children Incident**

Tragedy struck when a serial killer, later revealed to be William Afton, used the animatronics to lure and murder numerous children at various Freddy Fazbear's locations. Afton would disguise himself as a security guard or maintenance worker to gain access to the backrooms where he committed the atrocities. The bodies were then hidden inside the animatronic suits, which became possessed by the vengeful spirits of the murdered children.

**The First Game**

Fast-forward to the events of the first game (Five Nights at Freddy's). Mike Schmidt takes a job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where the haunted animatronics roam free at night. Players must survive five nights while avoiding being attacked and killed by the animatronics.

**The Bite of '87**

A pivotal event in the FNAF timeline is the "Bite of '87," where a man dressed in a yellow suit (later confirmed to be Springtrap, aka William Afton) enters a Freddy Fazbear's location and uses a hidden mechanism within an animatronic to lure kids into the backroom.
