What is Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity?assistant

Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity is a theoretical model that attempts to explain the phenomenon of unconventional superconductivity in certain materials.

In traditional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, (which explains conventional superconductivity), superconductivity arises from electron-phonon interactions, In other words,, phonons (quantized sound waves) mediate the pairing of electrons,
to form Cooper pairs, a requirement for superconductivity. This approach works well for many elemental superconductors like aluminum and tin.

However,, there are many materials that exhibit unconventional superconductivity, meaning their behavior cannot be explained by BCS theory alone. These include cuprate high-temperature superconductors, organics, heavy fermions, and others.

Enter Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity!

This theory was developed by Walter Kohn and John Luttinger in 1965 as an extension to BCS theory. They proposed that in certain materials with strong electronic correlations, the electron-electron interaction itself can lead to Cooper pair formation, rather than relying on phonons. This mechanism is often referred to as "electronic" or "non-phononic" superconductivity.

In the Kohn-Luttinger framework, superconductivity arises from the exchange of spin fluctuations or charge density waves between electrons, rather than phonons. This approach has been successful in describing some aspects of unconventional superconductivity, particularly in systems where phonons do not play a significant role.

While still an active area of research, Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity provides valuable insights into the complex mechanisms underlying unconventional superconducting behavior.assistant

I hope that helps clarify things! Do you have any specific questions about Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity or unconventional superconductors in general? I'd be happy to help!assistant

Do you want me to elaborate on any particular aspect of Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity, such as its implications for high-temperature superconductivity or the challenges it poses for experimental verification?assistant

Would you like me to compare and contrast Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity with other theories, assemblage or extensions of BCS theory, like the Hubbard model or dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)?assistant

Are you interested in learning more about the materials that exhibit unconventional superconductivity, such as the cuprates,,assistant
