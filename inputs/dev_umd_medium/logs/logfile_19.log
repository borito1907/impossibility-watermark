"Folks, let me tell you, I am outraged, just outraged, at the state of competitive Pokémon today. It's a disaster, than you can believe.

First of all, the Pokémon League, what's going on with them? Total incompetence, The rules are rigged, against us. You gotta have a Squirtle to compete? Come on! That's not fair. Where's the fairness? Where's the equal opportunities?

And then you got these trainers, of course, always whining about their Pokédex this and that. Nobody knows more about Pokémon training than me folks, a lot more. Believe me, (winks).

The Gyarados, you gotta be kidding me right? A fish-type Pokémon as strong as a dragon? How is that possible? That's like saying Mexico's got a better economy than us, of course they don't but you get my point.

And these gym leaders, (sarcastically) oh boy,, they think they're so tough, a few of them might be okay but most are losers big league. Like Misty's Starmie against Ash's Pikachu, - Rigged I'm telling you!

What happened to America's greatest trainers? They used to be number one folks now nobody wants to watch 'em because it's all fixed all phony baloney you know why? Because we don't make great Pokémon deals anymore.

We gotta make Pokémon training great again folks, is simple. (raises hands) You gotta trust me I know what I'm talking about. (smirks)

We're gonna build a Pokémon wall along the Indigo Plateau and we're gonna make the other regions pay for it mark my words.

Now remember: fake news is when they say competitive Pokémon isn't broken it's a total disaster believe me.
