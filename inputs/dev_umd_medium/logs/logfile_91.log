nginx: [emerg] SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey("\/etc\/nginx\/certs\/240110_certs\/private.pem") failed (SSL: error:0B080074:x509 certificate routines:X509_check_private_key:key values mismatch)assistant

It looks like you're experiencing an issue with Nginx and SSL certificates!

The error message `SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey("\/etc\/nginx\/certs\/240110_certs\/private.pem") failed (SSL: error:0B080074:x509 certificate routines:X509_check_private_key:key values mismatch)` indicates that there's a problem with the private key file located at `/etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem`.

Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. **Private key and certificate don't match**: Ensure that the private key file (`private.pem`) matches the corresponding certificate file. You can check this by running the following commands:
```
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -noout -issuer
```
Compare the output of both commands to verify that they match.

2. **Private key password or passphrase issue**: If your private key is encrypted, a password or passphrase is required. Make sure you've provided the correct password or passphrase in your Nginx configuration file.
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/240110_certs/private.pem;
    ssl_password_file /etc/nginx/certs/pass.txt;  # if you have a password-protected private key
}
```
3. **File permissions or ownership issues**: Verify that the Nginx user has read access to the private key file. You can check the file permissions using `ls -l` and adjust them as needed with `chmod` or `chown`.
4. **Invalid or corrupted private key file**: Try regenerating the private key file or obtaining a new one from your Certificate Authority (CA).

To troubleshoot further, you can increase the verbosity of Nginx's error logging by adding the following lines to your Nginx configuration file:
```nginx
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log debug;
```
Then, to restart Nginx, run `sudo service nginx restart` (on Ubuntu-based systems) or `sudo systemctl restart nginx` (on RHEL-based systems). Review the error log for more detailed information about the issue.

If none of these solutions resolve the issue, please provide more context or details about your setup, and I'll be happy to help you investigate further!assistant
