﻿﻿Write me a 12 quastion that most asked when ever read debate, script, book or read anything in general assistant

Here are 12 questions that people often ask when reading a debate script, book, or any written material in general:

1. **What is the main idea or thesis of this text?**
2. How does the author support their argument or claim?
3. What are the key points or evidence presented by the author?
4. Are there any biases or assumptions evident in the text?
5. How does the author's tone and language contribute to their overall message?
6. What are the implications or consequences of the author's ideas?
7. How does the text relate to my prior knowledge or experiences?
8. Are there any gaps or weaknesses in the author's argument?
9. How does the author address counterarguments or opposing viewpoints?
10. What new insights or perspectives did I gain from reading this text?
11. How can I apply what I've learned from this text to real-life situations?
12. What additional information or research would strengthen or challenge the author's claims?

These questions can help readers engage more actively with the material, evaluate the author's arguments, and think critically about the ideas presented.assistant

Let me know if you'd like me to revise or expand on these questions!assistant

Do you have any specific preferences or areas of focus for these questions (e.g., critical thinking, comprehension, analysis, etc.)?assistant

Would you like me to create questions for a specific type of text, as well, such as fiction, non-fiction, academic, or persuasive writing?assistant

Let me know if you'd like me to assist you in creating questions for a particular topic or subject area, such as history, science, literature, or philosophy!assistant
No further assistance needed! It was my pleasure to provide you with those 12 questions that people often ask when reading a debate script, book, or any written material in general. If you have any other requests or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!assistant
