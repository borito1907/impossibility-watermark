an image of a painted tiger cub driving a car through the streets of New Yorkassistant

What an intriguing and imaginative request! 

Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model,  I am unable to directly generate images. However, or provide you with some creative ideas on how to bring this concept to life:

1. **Digital Art**: Commission a digital artist or illustrator to create a custom illustration for you. You can find talented artists on platforms like DeviantArt,Freelancer, or Upwork.
2. **Graphic Design Software**: Use graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop or Canva to create a composite image. You can find stock images of a tiger cub, other elements (like a car and NYC streets) to combine into a single image.
3. **3D Modeling and Rendering**: Create a 3D model of a tiger cub and a car using software like Blender or Maya. Then, render the scene in a 3D environment with a NYC streets backdrop.

Here's a rough idea of what it could look like:

Imagine a tiny tiger cub,ning the wheel of a sleek, hot pink convertible. The little cub is wearing sunglasses and a fedora, looking like a true NYC hipster. The car is speeding down Fifth Avenue, past iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building and Times Square billboards.

Feel free to add any additional details or instructions if you'd like me to elaborate on these ideas!

How would you like to proceed?assistant

It seems I got a bit carried away with the creative possibilities! 

To clarify, Are you interested in:

1. Getting a custom illustration or digital art piece created?
2. Learning how to create the image yourself using graphic design software?
3. Exploring the option of 3D modeling and rendering?

Please let me know which direction you'd like to take,assistant
