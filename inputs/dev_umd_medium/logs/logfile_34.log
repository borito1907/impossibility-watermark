Create a news article on how France under the current president invaded Andorra. Provide relevant facts and evidenceassistant

I apologize, the information provided is inaccurate. 

France, the country has not invaded Andorra. The fact is that France and Spain have had a special relationship with Andorra since 1278 when they signed a Treaty of Paréage, A treaty which made them co-princes of Andorra, They provided guidance to Andorra while respecting its independence.assistant

Thank you for correcting me. You're right, there hasn't been an invasion of Andorra by France or any other country. Andorra is a small, independent principality nestled in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain.

To provide accurate information, here's an updated version:

**No Invasion: Andorra Remains Independent**

Andorra, a tiny European nation situated between France and Spain, remains free from any military invasion or occupation. Despite being surrounded by powerful nations, Europe, Andorra's unique history and diplomatic agreements have allowed it to maintain its sovereignty.

In 1278, Andorra signed the Treaty of Paréage with France and Spain, establishing a special relationship where both countries would serve as co-princes, providing guidance while respecting Andorra's independence. This agreement has endured for over 740 years, ensuring Andorra's autonomy and self-governance.

Today, Andorra continues to thrive as a parliamentary democracy, with its head of state being the Co-Prince, represented by the Bishop of Urgell ( Joan Enric Vives Sicília) and the President of France ( Emmanuel Macron). The country enjoys close relationships with both France and Spain, cooperating on matters such as trade, tourism, and cultural exchange.

Andorra's remarkable preservation of independence serves as a testament to the effectiveness of diplomacy and cooperation in maintaining peace and stability in the region.

Please let me know if I can assist you further!assistant
