What is Sorbonne University?assistant

Sorbonne University, a prestigious institution! Located in Paris, the City of Light, it's one of the oldest and most renowned universities in France.

The Sorbonne University has its roots dating back to 1257, when it was founded as the University of Paris by Robert de Sorbon, a chaplain to King Louis IX of France. Over time, it went through several transformations and reforms. Today, the university is divided into three autonomous institutions:

1. **University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne**: Focused on humanities, social sciences, and economics.
2. **University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle**: Emphasizes languages, literature, arts, and human sciences.
3. **University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne**: Offers a broad range of disciplines, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as humanities and social sciences.

These institutions form part of the Sorbonne University grouping, sharing a rich history, academic excellence, and a strong reputation worldwide. Many Nobel laureates, famous scholars, and influential thinkers have studied or taught at the Sorbonne University throughout its long history.
