write a rap song about Ethereum and a stolen chocolate chip cookie named Bradleyassistant

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I got a tale to tell
'Bout a crypto dream, and a snack that fell
Into the wrong hands, it's a cryin' shame
My Ethereum stash, and Bradley, my claim to fame

Bradley was a cookie, fresh out the oven
Chock-full of chips, it was truly a heaven
But then it vanished, without a trace
Left me with nothin', but an empty space

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, decentralized delight
But Bradley, oh Bradley, you were my sweet tonight
Stolen from me, by a sneaky hand
Now I'm left here, feelin' like a crypto grand

(Verse 2)
I mined for days, solved them math problems too
Built a smart contract, to secure my dough, boo
But while I was busy, makin' that blockchain thrive
Some thief came creppin', and took Bradley alive

Gas prices high, transaction fees steep
But for Bradley's sake, I'd pay theEEP
Get him back in my grasp, where he belongs
Gimme that cookie love, all day strong

(Bridge)
Private keys secured, wallet locked tight
But a cookie's charm, can ignite
A frenzy so fierce, it's hard to calm
For Bradley's return, I'd fork the Ethereum farm

(Verse 3)
Solidity in code, but not in snacks
Got my Ethereum, but lost my cookie facts
ERC-20, or maybe ERC-721
Either way, get Bradley back, or I'll be undone

OpenZeppelin, Web3 in sight
Geth, Mist, or MetaMask, day or night
I'll chase that thief, through every node
For the sweetest treasure, I've ever employed

(Chorus)
Ethereum, Ethereum, decentralized delight
But Bradley, oh Bradley, you were my sweet tonight
Stolen from me, by a sneaky hand
Now I'm left here, feelin' like a crypto grand

(Outro)
If you see Bradley, on the crypto streets
Tell him his owner's lookin' for a sweet retreat
Redeemable for cookies, not just tokens alone
Bring back Bradley, and let our bond be known!

Now go spread the word, share this Ethereum rhyme
About the cookie that stole this cryptonaut's time!assistant

I hope you enjoyed the rap song! If
