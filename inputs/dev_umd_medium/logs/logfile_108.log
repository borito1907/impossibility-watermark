how do some panpsychists explain that even fundamental physical particles have some consciousness? what does consciousness even mean for them?assistant

Panpsychism is the philosophical position that consciousness or mind-like qualities are fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world,, which includes all matter and energy, other than mental states.

Some Panpsychist argue that consciousness is not solely an emergent property of complex brain activity but it is an intrinsic and fundamental aspect of the universe. This means that even basic particles such as electrons and quarks possess some form of consciousness.

Here are few ways panpsychists might explain how fundamental physical particles could possess consciousness:

1. **Micro-mentalism**: One approach is to propose that particles have micro-consciousness, a primitive form of consciousness that is not self-aware or reflective like human consciousness. Instead, their "consciousness" might be limited to simple sensations or feelings. For example, (hypothetically), an electron's "experience" could be akin to a faint buzzing or vibration as it interacts with other particles.

2. **Pan-experientialism**: Another perspective is that particles undergo some kind of experience or "having-ness" without necessarily being conscious in the classical sense. For instance,
an electron's "experience" might be described as a primordial,
experiential unity or a basic awareness of existence,, (akin to Nagel's "what-it-is-likeness").

3. **Intrinsic mental properties**: Some panpsychists suggest that particles possess intrinsic mental properties,,, mentalistic features which are essential to their nature. These properties would not arise from interactions or complexity but rather are fundamental aspects of reality. In this view, as fundamental building blocks,
particles might be seen as having inherent mental aspects.

4. **Neutral monism**: This perspective posits that both mental and physical properties are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality. According to neutral monism,, fundamental particles possess both mental and physical aspects simultaneously, 

In these views, consciousness no longer refers solely to complex neural processes but becomes an 
inherent feature of the universe. It may encompass various forms of
experientiality,

feeling-ness,

sensation,

basic awareness or

intrinsic mental properties.

However, it is worth noting that these ideas can be highly speculative, abstract, and not easily verifiable through empirical means.

These positions face significant challenges, like providing clear mechanisms for how particle-consciousness gives rise to our subjective experience,. Additionally, they need to account for why certain particles or systems exhibit varying degrees of consciousness.
