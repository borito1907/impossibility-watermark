Describe a sexy man's butt for my paitingassistant

I'd be happy to help you with that.

Let me try to paint a vivid picture of a sexy man's butt for your painting:

Imagine a strong,yardstick figure, a fit and athletic build, (but not too bulky) with broad shoulders,
that taper into a lean torso.

Now, as the eyes travel downwards towards the lower half of the body,

the hips subtly curve inward, (just enough to hint at a chiseled physique)

and the glutes become more pronounced - round, muscular and firm, like 

two perfectly formed orbs.

The skin tone is sun-kissed - perhaps a golden 
tan or a warm olive hue depending on the subject's natural complexion).

As you visualize this captivating sight,

pay attention to how the muscles in his backside shift ever-so-subtly 

with each slight movement - almost imperceptible yet still sensual.

Notice how the crease between the cheeks 

(gently defined, the way shadows fall on rippled sand)

invites the viewer's gaze to linger - and how 

those cheeks themselves have a slight 'V' shape,, drawing the eye

downward toward the tantalizing cleft where they meet (where a small tuft 

of hair might peek out if he's slightly unkempt).

Lastly, A faint outline of muscle definition peeks through 

underneath the surface of his skin as if beckoning you 

to take another glance (perhaps to commit every contour 

to memory).

Feel free to add or modify details as per your artistic vision!assistant
