write a short story about sonic as spidermanassistant

In a world where Sonic the Hedgehog's dimension merged with Marvel's,, Sonic found himself in the midst of a bustling metropolis. As he explored the unfamiliar cityscape, in search of rings to fuel his way back home, (and a decent chili dog), he stumbled upon a mysterious artifact - Spider-Man's web-shooters.

Curious, and always up for a challenge, Sonic donned the devices, unsure what they did but eager to find out. Suddenly, the gadget's built-in computer, (which had previously been linked to Peter Parker's consciousness) recognized the blue blur's unique bio-signature.

'New User Detected...' JARVIS beeped.

The advanced AI rapidly synced with Sonic's abilities and memories, not unlike how it functioned with Spider-Man. The sudden influx of powers and knowledge overwhelmed the hedgehog at first, the AI advised Sonic to approach this newfound connection cautiously. 

As Sonic experimented with the web-shooters, to no avail initially, he accidentally entangled himself within an alleyway. Frustrated yet refusing to give up,,Sonic focused his extraordinary speed and agility on freeing himself from the sticky snare. Unknowingly tapping into Spider-Man's memories and tactics -his instincts began mirroring those of the wall-crawler.

Within mere moments, otherworldly reflexes allowed Sonic to deftly swing through the city using webs as if born to do so. Newfound skills merged with his natural talents the 'Blue Blur' transformed into something remarkable-the fastest superhero Manhattan had ever seen - Sonic-Man!

The web-slinging, (at incredible velocities) became Sonic-Man's game-changing technique as battled against the Sinister Six a rogue gallery consisting of Dr. Robotnik,  as Doctor Octopus Orbot as Kraven the Hunter Shadow as Mysterio and Metal Sonic as Vulture. 

These formidable foes converged
