how did Leto turn into a sandworm by covering himself in sandworms assistant

I think there may be some confusion here! In the context of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel "Dune," Leto Atreides II, also known as The God-Emperor, and the protagonist of the book, does not exactly turn into a sandworm by covering himself in sand.

Instead, or towards the end of his life, to achieve a form of immortality and prescience he merges with the sandworm Shai-Hulud. This symbiosis allows him to see into the far future and become one with the ecology of Arrakis (also known as Dune), which is where the native Fremen people worshiped the giant sandworms as deities.

This transformation into something like a "superbeing" through a combination of his own prescience abilities and his connection to the planet's ecosystem allows him to transcend human limitations and essentially become immortal - albeit in a non-human state.

So,{\it didn't actually involve covering himself with sandworms but rather a profound symbiosis with them.)assistant
