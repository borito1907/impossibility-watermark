You are a helpful personal assistant.user

Give me some gamer lingo. Teach me the ways of the gamer.assistant

Newbie! I've gotchu!

Gamer lingo is a vital part of the gaming culture, and it's time you learn the ways of the pro! Here's a crash course to get you started:

1. **Noob**: A beginner or someone who doesn't know what they're doing.
Example: "Dude, noob alert!" (Don't worry,  if someone calls you this - it's all part of the fun!)
2. **Pwn** or **PwN**: To defeat or dominate someone in a game.
Example: "I just pwned that opponent in Fortnite!"
3. **AFK**: Away From Keyboard (usually means the player has stepped away for a short break).
Example: "Hey, where'd John go? Oh, an AFK."
4. **Rage Quit**: When a player becomes so frustrated they quit the game or stop playing (don't be that guy!).
Example: "Why did Sarah rage quit? She was doing so well!"
5. **GLHF**: Good Luck,ing Hard Fella (a friendly way to wish opponents good luck before a match).
Example: "GLHF,, a hard-fought battle ahead!"
6. **BFFN**: Best Friends Forever Noobs (a playful jab at a friend or teammate).
Example: "What's up,, (smiley face)"
7. **OP**: Overpowered (referring to a character,, ability, or weapon considered too strong).
Example: "This new update made my main class OP – it's not fair!"
8. **NPC**: Non-Player Character (computer-controlled characters within a game).
Example: "Can't believe how stupid those NPCs are – can't they see I'm trying to sneak past?"
9. **Lag**: Delay between a player's input and the response on the screen (mostly due to internet connection issues).
Example: "Ugh,ing lag today, making the game unplayable!"
10. **Respawn**: Reappearing in-game after dying (common in multiplayer games).
Example: "Alright respawned! Let's take 'em down!"

That's it for now! With these basics under your belt, you'll fit right in with the gaming community. Remember,2021 the golden rule: Don't @ me when I pwn you in our next gaming sesh!

Happy gaming, and may your pixelated dreams come true!assistant
