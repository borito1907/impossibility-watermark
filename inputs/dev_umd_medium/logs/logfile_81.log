Can you summarize chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by chinua achebe in a single page?assistant

Here is a summary of chapters 15-19 of "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe:

**Chapter 15:** Okonkwo returns to his father's village, Umofia, after being banished for killing a kinsman. He is greeted with caution and suspicion by the villagers, but his cousin, Uchendu, welcomes him warmly. Okonkwo is troubled by his past actions and struggles to reconcile with himself.

**Chapter 16:** Okonkwo spends his days in idle contemplation, feeling disconnected from his people and traditions. His cousin, Uchendu, tries to offer guidance, urging Okonkwo to confront his past mistakes and seek forgiveness from the gods.

**Chapter 17:** Okonkwo receives an unexpected visit from Obierika, who brings news from their home village, Iguedo. Obierika tells Okonkwo about the increasing influence of Christianity and the British colonizers, which worries Okonkwo. He realizes that the world he knew is changing rapidly.

**Chapter 18:** Okonkwo's exile ends, and he returns to Iguedo. He finds his family prospering under the care of his friend, Obierika. However, he soon discovers that many changes have taken place during his absence: the Christian missionaries have built a church, and some villagers have converted.

**Chapter 19:** Tension builds as the villagers, including Okonkwo's own son, Nwoye, begin to embrace Christianity. The District Commissioner arrives, demanding that the villagers hand over a group of natives who had destroyed a Christian shrine. When they refuse, the Commissioner orders the arrest of several prominent villagers, including Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu. 

Overall, these chapters mark a turning point in the novel as Okonkwo grapples with his past, his identity, and the rapid transformation of his community under the influence of Christianity and colonialism.
