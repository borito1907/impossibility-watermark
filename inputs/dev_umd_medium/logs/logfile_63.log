What is the price of natural gas for consumers in Qatar?assistant

In Qatar, the natural gas is subsidized by the government,, not like other countries. The cost of natural gas for Qatari citizens is actually free, (zero cost). For expatriates and non-Qatari residents,, it's heavily subsidized and very cheap,
The exact prices may vary depending on certain factors but here are some approximate rates:

* For Qatari citizens: Free (0 QR/L or 0 USD/MMBtu)
* For expatriates and non-Qatari residents:
	+ Residential: around 0.10-0.15 Qatari Riyal per liter (approximately $0.03-$0.05 USD/MMBtu)
	+ Commercial/Industrial: around 0.20-0.30 Qatari Riyal per liter (approximately $0.06-$0.09 USD/MMBtu)

Keep in mind that these prices might be subject to slight changes, so it's always a good idea to check with the relevant authorities or providers for the most up-to-date information.
