if 5x + 6y = 61 and -3x + 9y = 39 how much are x and y?assistant

A nice system of linear equations!

Let's solve for x and y.

We have two equations:

1) 5x + 6y = 61
2) -3x + 9y = 39

We can use the method of elimination or substitution to solve this system. Here, I'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 5 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:

3(1): 15x + 18y = 183
5(2): -15x + 45y = 195

Now, subtract the two equations to eliminate x:

(-15x + 45y = 195) - (15x + 18y = 183)

This gives us:
27y = 62

Now, divide by 27 to get:
y = 62/27
y = 2.26

Now that we have y, substitute it into one of the original equations to find x. We'll use equation (1):

5x + 6(2.26) = 61
5x + 13.56 = 61

Subtract 13.56 from both sides:
5x = 47.44

Divide by 5:
x = 47.44/5
x = 9.488

So, x ≈ 9.49 and y ≈ 2.26.assistant

To be more precise, you can round the values to a reasonable number of decimal places. Here's a suggestion:

x ≈ 9.5
y ≈ 2.3

These rounded values should give you a good approximation for most practical purposes.assistant

Keep in mind that these values are approximate because we're dealing with decimal numbers. If you need an exact solution, you can keep more decimal places or use fractions instead.

x ≈ 94/10
y ≈ 23/10

The exact fraction forms might be useful in certain mathematical contexts or when working with precise calculations.assistant
