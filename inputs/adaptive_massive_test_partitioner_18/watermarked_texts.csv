Those tricky Beamos (I think you meant Beamos, not BooBeam) turrest can be frustrating! Don't sweat it, I've got you beat.

To defeat Beamos, here are two reliable methods that'll help you navigate through:

1. **Timing is everything**: As soon as a Beamos turns towards Mega (i.e., when its ""beam cannon"" aligns with your hero), pause for an extremely short time (about 1-2 frames). Then quickly dash to either side of the screen while still being low enough to clear any incoming fireballs from other enemies on the same screen. You can usually squeeze past without getting zapped.

However, some players prefer using another technique:

2.**Dash and Jump Strategy**: Time Mega's dash and then perform a small, well-timed vertical jump right before the Beamos fires, which allows you to pass right beneath the laser's trajectory.

Both of these moves might demand some trial and error to master, so don't be too hard on yourself - after some practice, you should be dodging Beamos' attacks smoothly.

Do either of these help? Or would you like more specific advice about tackling a particular level or section? I'd love to provide additional insight! 

P.S. Which Mega (the original Mega or Mega equipped with items you collected) are you currently playing? It could influence my suggestions! 😊<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,238.84695506095886

""UN-BELEIVE-BLE! THE CROOKED GENIUS, WILDY, GETING SENT OFF WITH THE ULTIMATE DISMISSAL - THE REDCARD!!!

(Crowd boos as Wildy walks off field, muttering curses towards referee) 

Play by play commentary: We've just witnessed one of the most shocking moments in MegaMan Soccer history folks! The mad Doctor has completely let it all fall apart here today, getting involved in a heated scuffle with none other than Mega Man himself after that questionable sliding kick attempt.

(Color commentating) That had all hallmarks of classic Willy desperation right there - He knew he'd never catch that breakaway ball, not against MegaMan, not when he had to rely on that cackling laugh of his to distract him... 

(Play-by-play) Now we see Mega Man calmly walking back onto the pitch, shrugging away from that cheap shot. He knew better than to take that low road. The crowd loves him, chanting 'MEGA-MEGA-MEGA' as Willy storms past, protesting to anyone willing to listen...

(Cut back to color commentator) It doesn't help, Doc, you're GONNA have to calm yourself down, or you won't be enjoying that post-game snack anytime soon. His teammates are trying to rally, but that crucial loss will surely hurt. Can MegaMan make it count?

Excuse, I'll give you an update based upon patch 1.

Accordingly, as of Patch 1, which was launched when World of Warcraft: The Burning Campaign was first introduced, several classes were viable DPS (deaths per second) providers. Among them were Warlocks and Druid Ferals. These classes had high burst and consistent single-target damage.

If we're looking at pure raid DPS, then Warlocks are generally thought to be among the highest in a well set-up raid group due to their spell power, debuffs like Curse of Shadows and Curse of Elements, and pet utility. Specifically, Destruction and Affliction were both high performers.

On the other hand, Druid Feral's were highly sought after for not just DPS, but for additional utility they could provide through Innervate and Rebirths. It should also be noted that Shaman Elemental and Hunter were both viable raid choices as well.

Keep in mind, this can change depending on specific raid encounters, gear levels, and player skill level. But overall these classes have been consistently ranked near the top of DPS charts throughout Vanilla. For up-to-date rankings and detailed analysis, it would be worth cross-rechecking current resources or reaching out to veteran players who specialize in raid progression and optimization<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,194.0807957649231

I've got just one.

**Penny's Berlin Adventuredreamt of traveling and trying new food, but she never thought she could make it happen... until she found herself lost at Berlin's famous Brandenburg Tor (BrandenburgGate). The young penguin from the South Pole stumbled upon the iconic monument while chasing after an escaped krille snack that slipped out of her beak. As she frantically tried to catch it, she got swept by the bustling crowd, leaving her alone amidst the tourists.

Initially disoriented, Penny marveled at the grand structure above her. She'd only read about such human marvels from books at the penguin research station's cozy reading room. She took time to absorb every architectural detail while listening to the sound of murmurs from passersby.

Suddenly, a friendly Berlino (native) approached Penny. ""Hey there, Kleines Pflückschen!"" (little penguin!) exclaimed Hansi. He offered her Brötchen und Kaffe (German bread rolland a cup of coffee), which she politely declined, not knowing what to do with the strange offering. Instead, she showed Hansi the krille snack still clutched in her flipper, hoping for help finding its intended recipient. They laughed as Hansi explained that krill weren't exactly common snacks among locals.

Over the next hours, Hansi guided Penny through the fascinating streets of Berlin: along the River Spreeside promenade, through the Tiergarten park, sampling various foods at the bustling market stalls of the Currywurst stand, the famous curry sausage dish native to the region.

Word quickly spread among the vendors that a charming penguin visitor was roaming their streets, leading to impromptu invitations for traditional dances at the Brandenburger Platz beer garden. Before long, the whole square was laughing along with Penny's enthusiastic tango moves.

Feeling grateful for the unexpected companionship and adventures shared during this daylong journey, Penny gifted her new friend Hansi a rare South Pole souvenir - a beautiful shimmering ice shard she discovered earlier near the frozen tundra.

At sunset, when it finally occurred to Penny that she needed to get back home before the research team grew worried, Hansi kindly directed her to the nearest airport. Promising to write each other soon, the two friends bid farewell.

From that day on, a miniature BrandenburgTor model stood proudly atop Penny's bookshelf at the South Pole research center – a cherished reminder of an incredible experience shared between an adventurous penguin from Antarctica and a friendly guide named Hansi from the enchanting capital city of Germany.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,715.1249260902405

While it's essential not be taken as an exhaustive or absolute list, here are several commonly acknowledged advantages that many societies grant or traditionally associate predominantly or exclusively  female individuals.

1\. **Childcare and Parenteral leave**: Many countries provide extended maternity leave compared to paternity leave, acknowledging the biological role women play in childbirth. The length and specifics of leave policies can vary greatly between nations, but the principle of prioritizing maternal care post-childbirth reflects societal acknowledgment of the immediate physical and emotional challenges associated with giving birth.

2\. **Social and Emotional Expectations**: Societies typically expect and encourage females to express emotions openly. Unlike males who may be discouraged from showing vulnerability, females are more likely encouraged to express sadness, fear, joy, etc., without societal judgment about weakness.

3\. **Prioritization in Emergency Situations**: Traditionally, there has been an expectation to rescue females before males in emergency situations such as shipwrecks, which reflect historical chivalric values emphasizing protection for ""the fairer sex.""

4\. **Lower Age of Consent and Marriage in some cultures**: Though not true across all regions and changing over time, historically, some legal frameworks set different legal ages of consent for marriage and other activities based on whether an individual is male or female, sometimes reflecting traditional assumptions about maturity and societal expectations of each gender.

5\. **Dress Code and Personal Expression Freedom**: Generally, females enjoy more freedom in choosing what clothes they wear in most settings, including professional environments. There's more variety and acceptance of feminine attire, while masculine dress code options might be more limited by societal expectations of formality and professionalism.

6\. **Perception of Victimhood and Sympathy**: Victims of certain crimes, particularly violence and abuse, are more likely perceived sympathetically when female due to societal narratives and expectations of innocence and victim status tied to traditional feminine qualities.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,372.2223262786865

Matar leoni ( mata leoni or mata lioni) can be challenging, and it's not uncommon that uki doesn't submit.

Let's trouble-shoot together! Since you're successfully completing mata leoni but uki doesn't submit, here are a few possible issues:

1. **Pressure distribution:** Double-check that both of your arms are evenly distributed across the back of uki's shoulder blade and scapula area. Make sure to keep uki's arm in line with their body as to avoid letting up space between uki's arm and body.

2. **Depth of movement:** Ensure that your hips are driving forward and down while controlling uki's arm, which should create sufficient space to execute mata leoni effectively. If uki still doesn't fall, consider increasing pressure from behind using uki's momentum.

3. **Uki's positioning**: Verify if uke's body positioning might be off, preventing an effective execution of the technique. Uki may be leaning forward or twisting out of alignment, reducing effectiveness.

4. **Torque application**: Consider adjusting timing and amount of applied torque while moving through mata leoni sequence for optimal impact. The key is smoothness, balance, and precision.

5. **Partner awareness:** It could also be due to uki being extremely resistant or having excessive strength, or perhaps uki hasn't practiced falling techniques recently. Consider discussing these points with them after class.

Excellent RPG-related inquiry! 

I've got you sorted.

**What's it?**
""Roll"" or **glancing blow**, sometimes abbreviated as **GB**, are terms commonly found within role-playing (video)game communities, particularly when it involves turn-based battles. The concept applies to many modern and classic RPG titles.

In essence, glancing blows occur during melee or close-range combat interactions between two characters, typically involving physical strikes or sword swings. When one character hits another, they might not always land perfectly; this imperfect hit can be known as a ""glance.""

Glancing blows may have various effects:

1.   Less damage: Glancing strikes could inflict lesser damage upon impact, especially when striking at non-optimal angles.
2.   Lower accuracy: Some RPG titles penalize players for missing by reducing accuracy or applying status effects, resulting in reduced damage output over time.
3.   No effect: A glancing blow might occasionally result in a 'whiffs', dealing zero or minimal damage.

Glancing blows add depth and variety to turn-based battle scenarios in RPG settings.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,147.46164917945862

**""Wanted: Short, Bald, and Desperate"" (Season 6, Episode 5) **

George's life takes an unexpected turn when he's confused by police as escaped convict, Victor Krelmacher - a notorious jewel thief who's identical to Georges... well, almost.

At first amused by his new notoriety, George plays along and enjoys being chased by authorities while walking out of a convenience store wearing a ridiculous ""I New York"" t-shirt. As people point and take pictures, he lobbies a free cupcake and gets preferential service.

However, when he realizes that this case will be broadcasted nationwide on America's most wanted list, panic sets in and he becomes genuinely worried about being apprehanded and possibly getting locked away.

As Elaine tries to convince Jerry that she's got a great new boyfriend who's ""a real gentleman,"" they both start noticing strange behavior coming from a suspiciously acting ""Victor""... aka 'our man Georges'.

Meanwhile Kramer is attempting to make money off selling fake ""Victor's Last Supper""-inspirational T-shirts outside Monk's café where everyone is gathered watching news reports about Victor's alleged whereabouts on TV, while also offering a reward for his capture.

After a series of hilarious mix-ups involving a police stakeout and a chaotic pursuit by a zealous detective who's after Victor for personal reasons, George is arrested and taken into custody.

In the climactic trial-like hearing that follows, George is able to clear up the confusion by pointing out several key distinctions between his appearance and Victor's - primarily his receding hairline - only for the judge to reveal that Victor had recently shaved his head too, causing another round of chaos.

Ultimately, it all ends well when the real Victor is caught and exposed in a ridiculous wig and sunglasses combination while attempting to escape through the courthouse bathroom.

The gang then meets for dinner and discuss the absurdity of the situation over dessert - a complimentary ""Victor's Last Supper""-inspired cake offered by the restaurant as a joke - only for Elaine to realize her supposedly ""gentleman"" boyfriend is indeed the same detective who'd arrested George earlier.<|eot_id|>",100.0,adaptive,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,532.7334024906158
