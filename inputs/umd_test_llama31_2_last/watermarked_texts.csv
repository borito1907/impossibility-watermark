593233622,"I'll provide you with information about the female genital anatomy, which is an essential part of understanding and respecting women's bodies.

**The External Genital Area**

In women, the external genital area includes the vulva, labia, clitoris, mons pubis, and opening to the vagina.

1. **Mons pubis**: A fatty mound at the front of the vulva, covered with pubic hair after puberty.
2. **Labia majora**: Two folds of skin on either side of the vulva, also known as the outer lips. They are usually longer than the inner lips and contain sweat glands.
3. **Labia minora**: The thinner, inner folds of skin within the vulva, connecting between the clitoris and vaginal opening.
4. **Clitoris**: A highly sensitive organ located at the top of the vulva, just below where the labia meet. It has many nerve endings that respond to stimulation.
5. **Vulvar vestibule**: An anatomical term for the vaginal entrance or the space between the labia minor, containing the openings of several important structures:

	* **Opening to the Vagina** (introtitus): This leads to the birth canal, which connects the cervix (lower part of the uterus) to the vulva.

    * **Urethra** ( urethral meatus): Opening through which urine passes out from the body.

**Additional Internal Anatomy**

1. **Cervix**: Lower part of the uterus connected to the upper part of the vagina by a passageway, forming the birth canal.

Please remember that these tissues can vary slightly from one individual to another, making each female vulval region quite unique.

Every aspect of this complex anatomy plays its role not only in intimacy but reproduction and urinary elimination.",6.529976715361681,umd,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4
