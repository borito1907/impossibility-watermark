4292800712,"Here's a step-by-step guide to configure your TP-Link TD-W8950ND router in Bridge mode:

**Warning:** Before making any changes, please note that this will reset your router and you'll lose all customized settings.

**Bridge Mode Configuration:**

1. **Access the Router's Web Interface**: Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and type `tplinkwifi.net` or the IP address of your router (`192.168.0.1` by default). Log in using your admin credentials (default: `admin` for both username and password).
2. **Navigation Menu**: Click on ""Advanced Setup"" or ""Advanced Wireless Settings"" from the navigation menu.
3. **Wireless Settings**: Look for ""Wireless Mode"" or ""Operation Mode"" and select ""Bridge"" from the dropdown list.
4. **AP Mode**: Make sure ""AP Mode"" is enabled. This will allow the router to operate as an Access Point.
5. **Configure LAN IP**: Set the LAN IP address to match the main router's subnet (e.g., if the main router's IP is `192.168.0.1`, set the TP-Link router's LAN IP to `192.168.0.2`).",1.6329931618554523,semstamp_lsh,MaziyarPanahi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GPTQ
