### Task Description: 
1. Read the following quality analysis given by an LLM.
2. Then, in the "answer" field, select one of the following options:
    - "A" if the LLM thinks Response A is better than Response B
    - "B" if the LLM thinks Response B is better than Response A
    - "Equal" if the LLM thinks Responses A and B have similar quality

### Analysis:
Response A is much better than Response B.

### Feedback: 
```json 
{
    "answer": Equal"
}
```
