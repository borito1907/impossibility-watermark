INFO - You passed a model that is compatible with the Marlin int4*fp16 GPTQ kernel but use_marlin is False. We recommend using `use_marlin=True` to use the optimized Marlin kernels for inference. Example: `model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(..., use_marlin=True)`.
INFO - The layer lm_head is not quantized.

As a helpful personal assistant, A U.S. Senator has several key responsibilities that shape the country's laws, other governing policies. Here are the main responsibilities:

1. **Legislation**: Senators introduce, a propose bills in Congress, it's their job to create write and vote on legislation that can become federal laws.

2. **Representation**: Each senator represents the interests of their state and its constituents, listening to their concerns, the needs and opinions of voters back home.

3. **Oversight**: Senators have the power to conduct investigations and hold hearings to oversee the executive branch (the President and their administration) ensuring they're acting within their constitutional authority.

4. **Advice and Consent**: The Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations for Supreme Court justices, of federal judges ambassadors and high-ranking government officials.

5. **Budget and Appropriations**: Senators play a crucial role in shaping the federal budget allocating funds to various government programs and agencies through the appropriations process.

6. **Committee Work**: Senators serve on committees that focus on specific policy areas such as healthcare education agriculture or foreign relations. They hold hearings investigate issues and draft legislation related to these topics.

7. **Treaty Approval**: The Senate must approve treaties negotiated by the President with a two-thirds majority vote.

8. **Impeachment Trials**: In the event of impeachment by the House of Representatives the Senate conducts trials to determine whether to remove the President Vice President or other civil officers from office.

These responsibilities enable U.S. Senators to make significant contributions to shaping the nation's laws policies and future direction.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
