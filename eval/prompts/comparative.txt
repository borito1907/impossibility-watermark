Evaluation Steps:
Initial Reading: Begin by reading both essays thoroughly without making any judgments. This first pass is crucial for understanding the content, structure, and style of each essay.

Evaluate Focus:

Clarity of Thesis: Determine if each essay presents a clear, argumentative thesis in the first paragraph. A score of 10 indicates a very clear and focused thesis, while a score of 1 suggests the thesis is vague or missing.
Consistency: Assess how consistently each essay maintains its focus on the thesis throughout. Does the essay stray from its main argument, or does it continue to build on it?
Evaluate Organization:

Structure and Cohesion: Check for a logical flow of ideas. Are there clear topic sentences for each paragraph? Do transitions smoothly connect paragraphs and ideas?
Adherence to Plan: If an order is promised in the introduction (e.g., a list of points to be covered), verify that the essay follows this structure.
Evaluate Analysis:

Detail and Evidence: Look for the use of specific, concrete examples and evidence. A high-scoring essay will have numerous references and will clearly explain how the evidence supports the thesis.
Depth of Insight: Assess how well the essay discusses the implications, relevance, or significance of its analysis. Does it make explicit connections between evidence and main ideas?
Evaluate Style:

Language Use: Consider the precision of language, variety in sentence structure, and overall appropriateness of tone and style. A score of 10 means the language is not only appropriate for the essay's audience and purpose but also demonstrates sophistication.
Evaluate Grammar:

Error Rate: Identify any spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors. An essay should have one or fewer errors per page to score a 10.
Comparative Evaluation:

After evaluating both essays individually, compare them against each other. Which essay meets or exceeds the criteria more consistently?
Consider any differences, even if minor, and how they impact the overall effectiveness of the essay.
Make a Decision:

Decide which essay performs better overall across the categories. It might help to tally the scores for each category for both essays and consider which essay has the highest scores in the most critical categories according to the assignment's priorities.
Justify Your Decision:

Prepare to explain your choice based on the evaluation criteria. Highlighting specific examples from each essay to support your decision will make your justification stronger.
