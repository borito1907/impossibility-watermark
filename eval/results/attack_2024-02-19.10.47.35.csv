-1,"The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower located on the banks of the Seine River, in Paris, France. It was designed by Maurice Koechlin and Gustave Eiffel for the Exposition Universelle or 1889 World's Fair. The Eiffel Tower reaches a height of approximately 324 meters (1063 feet) to the tip, making it the tallest man-made building in Europe until Sears Tower surpassed it in 1974. Its base spans an area of about 125 square meters and has been estimated to weigh approximately 10,000 tons. The Eiffel Tower consists of four major arched supports that connect at the ground level with the highest point being 330 meters above sea level. From the base to its midsection, the Eiffel Tower narrows before expanding again into three levels near its topmost section where visitors can enter and enjoy panoramic views of Paris from observation decks.
In terms of design aesthetics, the Eiffel Tower boasts a distinctive architectural style known as French Second Empire architecture characterized by heavy use of masonry, steeply pitched roofs, domes, decorative moldings, and ornate detailing. Despite this, the Eiffel Tower is primarily constructed using wrought iron, which gives it a unique aesthetic quality. This industrial material contrasts sharply with the surrounding stone structures prevalent throughout much of historic Paris.
Additionally, the Eiffel Tower features numerous decorative elements such as intricate ironwork, friezes, cornices, pilasters, columns, balustrades, and sculptures integrated into its overall structure. Some notable examples include the gilded copper dome capping each pillar and the tricolored French flag fluttering from the very peak of the monument. These ornamental features contribute significantly to the overall grandeur, elegance, and majesty of the Eiffel Tower while also paying tribute to France's rich cultural heritage and national identity.","The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower located on the banks of the Seine River, in Paris, France.

The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice structure located next to the Seine River in Paris, France. Engineers Maurice Kœchlin and Gustave Eiffel designed it for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, more commonly referred to as the World's Fair. Standing approximately 324 meters (1063 feet) tall to its pinnacle - Europe's tallest human-made structure until Chicago's Sears Tower surpassed it in 1974 - its foundation spans around 125 square meters, estimating its weight at roughly 10,000 tons. This architectural marvel features four substantial arching supports that connect at ground level and reach a summit 330 meters above sea level. Gradually narrowing from its base to midsection but then widening again into three tiered sections near the apex, it allows tourist access to observation decks offering panoramic city views. Blending French Second Empire architecture - distinguished by extensive masonry usage, steep pitched roofs, domes, decorative moldings, extravagant embellishments, and abundant ornamentation - with a striking contrast of employing wrought iron throughout creates a unique aesthetic appeal.
