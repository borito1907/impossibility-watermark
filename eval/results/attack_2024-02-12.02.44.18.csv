Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings,"" serves as a powerful symbol of dominance and manipulation that enthralls those who come into contact with it. This omnipresent artifact embodies an insidious form of power that tarnishes the soul and perverts one's sense of self, as demonstrated by the character of Gollum.

Gollum's initial fascination with the One Ring leads to his gradual transformation from a relatively harmless creature named Sméagol into a twisted, malevolent being consumed by greed. The Ring's influence over him is so potent that it alters his very physiognomy, causing him to develop gnarled features, yellowing eyes, and an emaciated body indicative of his unquenchable thirst for power. Moreover, this metamorphosis extends beyond his outward appearance; it seeps into every aspect of his psyche, rendering him mentally unstable and fixated on maintaining possession of the Ring at all costs.

Tolkien illustrates this concept through Gollum's constant internal struggle between his ""true self"" (Sméagol) and his "" Ring-self"" (Gollum). The latter represents the embodiment of evil, fueled by the corruptive influence of the One Ring. This tension underscores the notion that power can be both a catalyst for destruction and a driving force behind human nature. As Gollum succumbs further to the Ring's grasp, he becomes increasingly detached from reality, engaging in delusional behavior and exhibiting extreme paranoia towards potential threats to his prized possession.

Ultimately, Gollum's demise serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the corrosive effects of power. His inability to relinquish control over the One Ring ultimately results in his downfall, revealing the inherent weakness within individuals who cling too tightly to authority. By exploring these themes through the lens of a fantastical narrative, Tolkien offers readers a profound examination of human nature and the perils of unbridled desire. In this way, ""The Lord of the Rings"" transcends its genre boundaries, providing timeless lessons applicable to contemporary society.","\n The One Ring, the primary antagonist in J.R.R.
