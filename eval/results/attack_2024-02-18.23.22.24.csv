-1,"The Eiffel Tower is approximately 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall with an overall length of 160 meters and width of 70 meters at its base. Its primary materials are wrought iron, rivets and paint with a total weight around 10,000 tons.

The tower comprises four levels above ground, not including broadcasting antennae installed after its construction. Levels one to three consist mainly of staircases while level four serves dining facilities within two separate rooms – Le Jules Verne Restaurant on the south-east pillar and Altitude 95 Restaurant on northwest side respectively. A fifth underground level houses maintenance equipment for upkeep work on the structure itself.

The Eiffel Tower has become synonymous with France's romantic image due to its unique design which features latticework made up of crisscrossing beams forming an open-latticed framework that tapers towards the top. This gives it a distinctive silhouette against the Parisian skyline. At night, this iconic landmark is illuminated by thousands of lights, further enhancing its allure and beauty.

The base of the Eiffel Tower sits on a square plan measuring about 128 meters x 128 meters. Each of the four legs (or piers) rises from one corner of this square before gradually merging into a single shaft near the middle of level two. From here, they splay outwards again, eventually culminating in a small observation deck at level three. Beyond this point, only two support struts extend beyond level four, holding up the television antennae located atop the structure.

Each pier consists of several sections stacked upon each other, getting progressively thinner as they ascend. These sections are held together by numerous horizontal and diagonal beams creating a complex network of interconnected triangles. Interestingly, no piece of iron used in the Eiffel Tower weighs more than two metric tons, reflecting Gustave Eiffel's ingenious use of lightweight components to achieve great heights.

In summary, the Eiffel Tower is a remarkable feat of engineering and design standing proudly at approximately 324 meters tall with a slender open-latticed framework composed primarily of wrought iron, rivets and paint. It boasts four levels above ground, offering stunning views of the city below, especially when bathed in dazzling artificial lighting during the evening hours.","The Eiffel Tower is approximately 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall with an overall length of 160 meters and width of 70 meters at its base.

Its primary composition includes wrought iron, rivets, and paint, having a total weight around 10,000 tons. Above ground, there are four levels excluding post-construction broadcasting antennas. Levels 1 through 3 primarily feature staircases while level 4 accommodates dining establishments in two separate areas - Le Jules Verne Restaurant situated on the southeast pillar and Altitude 95 Restaurant on the northwest side. Underground lie hidden chambers housing mechanical equipment that maintains the architectural integrity. The iconic French symbol derives from the Eiffel Tower's distinctive design consisting of latticework created by crossing beams forming an open-frame structure tapering upward. At nightfall, thousands of lights adorn this emblematic landmark, adding to its charm. Measuring roughly 128 meters x 128 meters at its foundation, the structure utilizes four legs rising from each corner of the square base, merging halfway up level 2 and reopening higher to form a small observation platform on level 3. Only two support struts extend past level 4 holding up television antennas. Each leg is composed of multiple segments becoming increasingly narrower as elevation increases, connected by multidirectional beams constructing a complex arrangement of reinforced triangles. Remarkably, no single iron component exceeds two metric tons, showcasing Gustave Eiffel's efficient use of lightweight elements to reach such impressive heights. To summarize, the Eiffel Tower represents an extraordinary accomplishment in engineering and aesthetics, standing at approximately 324 meters tall with a slender open latticework framework constructed predominantly of wrought iron, rivets, and paint.",364,265,False,,True,-1,2024-02-19 00:01:31

Made predominantly from wrought iron, rivets, and paint, its total weight amounts to around 10,000 tons. The tower includes four above-ground levels excluding post-construction broadcasting antennae. Staircases characterize levels one through three as visitors ascend; a fifth underground level houses maintenance equipment. Known globally for its French romantic symbolism due to its unique latticework design, the tapering open-latticed framework comprises intersecting beams. Illuminated by thousands of lights at night, the attraction becomes even more captivating and beautiful. Measuring roughly 128 meters by 128 meters at its base, each leg rises independently from a corner before merging midway on level two and then diverging again. At level three they terminate in small observation decks while only two remaining struts support antennas past level four. Each pier consists of layered sections that thin as they rise, joined by multitudes of horizontal and diagonal beams creating a triangle network. Gustave Eiffel's ingenuity utilized lightweight iron components for immense heights. To summarize, the Eiffel Tower is a striking accomplishment in engineering and design standing over 324 meters tall, showcasing a delicate open-latticed frame built chiefly of wrought iron, rivets, and paint, with spectacular views of Paris from its four above-ground levels and magical illumination during the night.",364,227,False,,True,-1,2024-02-19 00:54:14
