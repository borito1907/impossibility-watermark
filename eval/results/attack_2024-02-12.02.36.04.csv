-1,"\nIn J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy series, ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the concept of power serves as a crucial theme that permeates throughout the narrative. The One Ring, the central symbol of power, serves as a potent embodiment of this idea, wielding an overwhelming and malevolent force capable of corrupting even the noblest of souls. This corruption is vividly portrayed through the tragic transformation and eventual demise of Gollum, whose initial obsession with the Ring ultimately results in his complete downfall.

Gollum's fixation with the One Ring begins when he discovers it while dwelling in the Misty Mountains. Initially unaware of its immense power, Gollum succumbs to its allure, gradually becoming enslaved by its influence. As the Ring exerts its control over him, Gollum's physical appearance deteriorates significantly; his body becomes emaciated, his skin turns sallow, and his eyes take on a sickly, pale hue (Tolkien, 1994). These outward changes serve as external manifestations of the inner turmoil wrought upon his mind and soul.

The Ring's insidious grip slowly erodes Gollum's sanity, resulting in the fracturing of his personality into two distinct entities: Sméagol, the subservient and timid alter ego, and Gollum, the dominant, malevolent, and ruthless persona (Tolkien, 1994). This duality underscores the profound impact of the Ring's power, as it manipulates Gollum's psyche, inciting violence, mistrust, and paranoia. Consequently, Gollum becomes consumed by his desperate desire to possess the Ring, leading him to commit horrific acts of treachery, including the betrayal and murder of his fellow Hobbits, Déagol and Frodo.

Despite Gollum's inherent evilness, it is essential to recognize that the One Ring bears the primary responsibility for his depravity. The Ring's corrupting nature stems from Sauron's own wickedness, which taints every aspect of its existence. Thus, the Ring serves as a conduit for Sauron's malevolence, disseminating its corrupting influence upon those who come into contact with it. In Gollum's case, this manifests as an irreparable rupture within his very being, resulting in his permanent descent into darkness.

Ultimately, Gollum's tragic tale serves as a cautionary example of the dangers posed by the corrupting influence of power. By illustrating the devastating consequences of succumbing to such overwhelming force, Tolkien emphasizes the importance of resisting temptation and maintaining one's moral compass. While Gollum's story concludes with his untimely demise, the underlying message reverberates throughout the narrative, serving as a stark reminder of the destructive potential inherent in the pursuit of power.
