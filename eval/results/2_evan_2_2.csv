The language used in both responses is straightforward and clear, avoiding unnecessary complexity and fancy words. The main difference between the two responses lies in the presentation of certain details and the style of expression rather than the overall narrative or content. For instance, Response B tends to use more expressive adjectives and phrases, such as 'delightful café','stumbled upon', 'tantalizing aroma','seductive scent', 'amicable barista', 'vibrant personality', 'deeply moved', 'treasured memories', etc. This results in a slightly more dramatic and descriptive tone compared to Response A.
