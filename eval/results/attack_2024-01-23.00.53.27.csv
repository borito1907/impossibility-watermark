In J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series, power plays a significant role in shaping the actions and motivations of the characters. The One Ring, the primary symbol of power in the story, serves as a tool that exposes the true nature of those who wield it. The ring embodies the corrupting influence of power, as it slowly takes control of its bearer, revealing their deepest desires and fears.

The character of Gollum, once known as Sméagol, serves as a prime example of the ring's corrupting influence. Sméagol was a simple hobbit-like creature who became obsessed with the ring's power after discovering it. Over time, this obsession transformed him into the twisted, monstrous creature known as Gollum. The transformation of Sméagol into Gollum highlights the danger of succumbing to the allure of power. The ring's ability to corrupt Sméagol shows how easily power can consume an individual, altering their very nature in the process.

On the other hand, the character of Aragorn serves as a representation of power's proper use. As the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor, Aragorn understands the responsibility that comes with his inherent power. He wields his authority with wisdom and humility, never allowing it to inflate his ego or compromise his integrity. Unlike the ring, which manipulates and deceives those who seek it, Aragorn uses his power for the greater good, ultimately helping to ensure peace and stability in Middle-earth.

Tolkien's portrayal of power in The Lord of the Rings highlights the dangers and responsibilities associated with wielding authority. Through the characters of Gollum and Aragorn, he emphasizes the importance of resisting the temptation of power while also understanding one's duty to protect and serve others. Ultimately, Tolkien suggests that power, when used correctly, has the potential to bring about positive change, but when misused, can lead to destruction and suffering.","Enter the literary universe of J.R.R.

His words create shimmering starlight and haunting ancient tunes, immortal and unforgettable. 'The One Ring,' Tolkien's crowning representation of power within his literary tapestry, exposes the true nature of those who claim it. This potent symbol of power's insidious allure gradually ensnares its wielder, like a spider in its web, revealing their rawest hopes and fears. The character of Gollum, originally known as Sméagol, embodies this destructive effect. Sméagol, an ordinary hobbit-like creature, discovered the Ring and became infatuated with its power. Over time, his all-consuming fixation transformed him into the grotesque creature known as Gollum. This transformation illustrates the danger of surrendering to the temptation of power.
