The One Ring serves as a central symbol of power, representing both its allure and destructive capabilities. The transformation and ultimate fate of Gollum, one of the primary characters in the story, effectively illustrate these themes.

Gollum's initial encounter with the One Ring results in an immediate and irresistible attraction, leading him to abandon his previous identity as Sméagol and become consumed by the Ring's influence. Over time, this influence corrupts Gollum's physical appearance and personality, rendering him unrecognizable from his former self. His obsession with the Ring leads him to engage in treacherous behavior, manipulating others to achieve his own ends while constantly striving to reclaim what he lost.

The Ring's ability to shape Gollum's actions and decisions becomes particularly evident when examining his relationship with Frodo Baggins, the hobbit tasked with destroying the One Ring. Despite recognizing the inherent danger posed by the Ring, Gollum cannot resist its call and ultimately betrays Frodo, attempting to seize the Ring for himself. This act underscores the corrosive effect of power on individual morality, demonstrating how it can transform even the most seemingly innocent creatures into ruthless villains.

Moreover, Gollum's fixation on the One Ring highlights the insidious nature of power, which often masquerades as something desirable or beneficial. By presenting itself as a means to attain supremacy over others, the Ring entices Gollum with promises of greatness and invulnerability. In doing so, it exposes the fundamental flaw of seeking power at any cost, revealing that such pursuit ultimately leads to ruin and despair.

Ultimately, Gollum's demise serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the pernicious consequences of wielding absolute power. His tragic end serves as a stark reminder of the necessity for humility, self-control, and moral responsibility, urging readers to resist the allure of power and instead strive for balance and harmony within their lives. Through Gollum's harrowing journey, Tolkien masterfully delves into the complexities of power, offering invaluable insights into human nature and the timeless struggle between good and evil.","\nIn J.R.R.
