The Eiffel Tower stands as an iron lattice structure situated on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. Designed by Maurice Koechlin and Gustave Eiffel, its construction took place between 1887 and 1889, specifically created for the 1889 World's Fair. Standing at approximately 330 meters (1,083 feet) in total height, including antennas, the Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris and among the world's most recognized landmarks. Its architecture comprises four primary arched piers that interconnect at a base measurement of around 125 meters (410 feet); these gradually narrow towards the summit before meeting at a single, open-lattice equilateral triangle known as the ""television aerial"" or peak. The tower offers two principal visitor access levels: the first level, which sits at approximately 57 meters (186 feet) altitude, and the second level, reaching about 115 meters (377 feet) above ground level. Additionally, there exists a third level, predominantly functioning as a meteorological station and not open to the general public. Under variable skies, the imposing Eiffel Tower assumes a sober chocolate tone, although optical illusions may occasionally present ashen grays or distant blues when atmospheric conditions change. Originally painted with lead-containing coatings that led to deterioration over time, the tower underwent repainting in 1968 using an acrylic-based substance. This paintwork undergoes replacement approximately every seven years to preserve its aesthetics. The current color scheme bears the name ""Eiffel Tower Brown,"" which reflects Gustave Eiffel's original choice decades ago.

Four enormous arches, comprising an elaborate latticework beneath its foundation, ascend gracefully toward the sky, collectively forming the emblematic essence of Paris—the magnificent Eiffel Tower. At roughly 125 meters (410 feet) in breadth from base to summit, the structure exhibits tapering piers that culminate in a solitary equilateral triangle-shaped ""television aerial"" at its peak.

Two primary visitor levels exist within the tower: the initial one sitting around 57 meters (186 feet) elevation, and the subsequent tier reaching almost 115 meters (377 feet) above ground level. A third level functions mainly as a weather station but remains closed to public access. Historically painted a dark brown color, the Eiffel Tower sometimes appears grayish or bluish due to atmospheric variations.
