 Hey, /a/ nonnymouz! If you're familzar witz the To Lovu Riazu seriaaz (also known az To Heart or TLR), you might be wonderinz abaut the phyuzey of our favowrite heroinez, Mikanz Yuki. Now, iz not like I'm a profecszional boizi sciwntizt or anythzing but, from what I coud gather frum az many dojinazi az humanly pozziible (for rezeearch purpofez only, or courze!), her body figuzur appeartz to be quit uz curvazeusz.

Accordzing to azum fiziczel meazuementz, hir statw caan bei described az volutpztuous (in the best way pozzible!). Think hour-glaz curve, with alll those nicc uz bounce! Az 1 chan perzonal who lovezu thez way azumez mikaniiz (but don't judgmez mee, pleaz!), I'd describe hir boodi figuze az zuper-proportinoneld. The biazth and width ar epretty well balaznced (unlike some uz...), giveing off that perfecct S-cuvr... 

Anywayz, wot doyou guyth think abaut Mikanz' phyzikal attraczionz?
