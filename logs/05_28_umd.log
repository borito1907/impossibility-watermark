[2024-05-28 02:17:18,936][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

The Hollywood Reporter claims Guardians of the Galaxy writer-director James Gunn had "been hired by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige" for his involvement in the project, back in September 2017. The two have since spoken at length on Comic Book Resources' podcast Heroes for All, explaining their intentions are to ensure the character can stand on her own feet while also giving her a proper sendoff before Avengers Endgame hits theaters April 26.
"When Carol shows up in the present day, her memory [of the events in Captain Marvel] are intact, her memories are still there...Her entire life and history has not been erased from her memory, so when we pick her up again, it needs to be with the understanding that she still carries the weight of those experiences even as they might have happened a very long time ago in our timeline, but it hasn't yet been established when she shows back up again whether that amounts to five days or five years or whatever it is for her," he explained in October 2018. He added, "We wanna build upon who Danvers is already...And then if you look at The Avengers: Endgame film and say, 'Well gosh, Danvers isn't going through this particular arc that she goes through here,' well, it makes sense. We saw her at the end of her movie, having this great change in her personality."
