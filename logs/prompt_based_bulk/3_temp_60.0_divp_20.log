Sauron's lust for power has consumed him entirely, leading him to sacrifice his own physical form in pursuit of omnipotence. His minions, the Nazgûl,, the most powerful of whom is the Witch-king, their leader, are equally enthralled by the promise of power, to the point where they have abandoned their very humanity.\n\nConversely, the Free Peoples of Middle-earth recognize the dangers of unchecked power and strive to limit its concentration. The Council of Elrond, comprised of wise and powerful individuals from various realms, to decide the fate of the One Ring, exemplifies this ethos.
