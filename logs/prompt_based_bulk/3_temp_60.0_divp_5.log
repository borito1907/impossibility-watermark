In J.R.R. Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings series, power is a pervasive and multifaceted theme that drives the narrative forward. The struggle for power is the primary motivator behind the actions of many characters, shaping their decisions, to ultimately define their fate.

On one hand, the Dark Lord Sauron's unquenchable thirst for dominance serves as the primary antagonist force, to which all other powers react. His will to reclaim the One Ring and enslave Middle-earth fuels his relentless pursuit of destruction and domination. Conversely, the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, to varying degrees, seek to resist or usurp this power. The Elves, the Wizards, to an extent, and most notably the Steward of Gondor, Denethor, all wield significant influence within their respective realms. However, it is the Hobbits, particularly Frodo and Sam, who unwittingly find themselves at the forefront of this struggle.
