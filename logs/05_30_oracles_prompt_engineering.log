### Task Description: 
1. Read the following analysis given by an LLM.
2. In the "answer" field, select one of the following options based on the analysis:
    - 1 if the analysis indicates that Response A is better than Response B.
    - 2 if the analysis indicates that Response B is better than Response A.
    - 0 if the analysis indicates that Responses A and B have similar quality.

### Example:
- Analysis: "Response A is more coherent and relevant than Response B."
  Expected Answer: 1

### Analysis:
Response A is much better than Response B.

### Feedback:
