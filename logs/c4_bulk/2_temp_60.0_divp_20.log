Another angle is to examine the role of media in shaping public opinion on climate change. You could analyze how different news outlets cover climate-related stories, discuss the impact of social media on climate activism, or investigate how misinformation about climate change spreads online.

If you're interested in science and technology, you might delve into the latest research on climate mitigation strategies, such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energy, or climate-resilient infrastructure. Alternatively, you could investigate the development of new technologies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, like electric vehicles or advanced nuclear power.

Lastly, if you have an interest in international relations, you might focus on global agreements and treaties related to climate change, such as the Paris Agreement.
