The Legislative Branch

Chapter 13: The Legislative Branch

**Introduction**

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain the structure and powers of Congress as outlined in Article I of the Constitution.
2. Identify the role of Congress in lawmaking, representation, and oversight.
3. Understand the differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate.
4. Describe the process by which bills become laws.
5. Analyze the checks and balances between the legislative branch and other branches of government.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Bicameral Legislature**: A two-chambered legislature with both a House of Representatives and a Senate.
2. **Separation of Powers**: The distribution of power among the three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial).
3. **Checks and Balances**: The system that allows each branch to limit or "check" the actions of another branch.

The Legislative Branch

Chapter 13: The Legislative Branch

**Introduction**

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain the structure and powers of Congress as outlined in Article I of the Constitution.
2. Identify the role of Congress in lawmaking, representation, and oversight.
3. Understand the differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate.
4. Describe the process by which bills become laws.
5. Analyze the checks and balances between the legislative branch and other branches of government.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Bicameral Legislature**: A two-chambered legislature with both a House of Representatives and a Senate.
2. **Separation of Powers**: The distribution of power among the three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial).
3. **Checks and Balances**: The system that allows each branch to limit or "check" the actions of another branch.
4. **Lawmaking**: The process of creating new laws through Congress's passage of bills.
