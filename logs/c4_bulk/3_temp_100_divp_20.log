Here is my response:

The concept of power is a pervasive theme throughout J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. Power can be wielded for good or evil, and the characters' relationships with it serve as a moral litmus test, revealing their true nature and intentions. 

Gandalf, a powerful wizard, exemplifies the responsible use of power. He possesses great magical abilities, yet he exercises restraint, intervening only when necessary to guide events toward a positive outcome. His power is not employed for personal gain or glory but rather to protect and serve others. In contrast, the Dark Lord Sauron's power is rooted in domination and control, fueled by his lust for conquest and destruction. Sauron's power is thus inherently corrupting, leading him to enslave and destroy those who oppose him. This dichotomy highlights the divergent paths that power can take, depending on the motivations of its possessor. 

Gollum, a complex and conflicted character, embodies the struggle between the corrupting influence of power and the redeeming potential of redemption. His obsessive possession of the One Ring, the source of Sauron's power, has consumed him, warping his sense of self and morality.
