[2024-05-23 23:54:17,518][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), closing out a floor debate over spending priorities and opening a new front on the midterm campaign trail.
As expected, no Democrats voted for the blueprint from Ryan. The former Republican vice presidential nominee's plan returns to ideas that have come to define the GOP, including ending federal deficits by cutting taxes on the rich, revamping Medicare and slashing almost every other aspect of government.
In a vote of 219-205, House Republicans showed an unusual display of cohesion, as they have for the last four years on Ryan's proposals, presenting voters with a unified snapshot of GOP priorities.
"This document is our vision for getting Americans back to work and our budget back in balance," said House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).
Democrats swiftly showed how they would use the vote as campaign fodder in the coming midterm elections to portray the GOP as out-of-step with most Americans.
"This House Republican budget is the worst I have ever seen," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the budget committee, to applause on the House floor. "At every juncture in this House Republican budget, they choose to protect very powerful special interests and the most wealthy in the country at the expense of everybody else."
Like President Obama's budget earlier this year, the GOP document is not expected to be adopted. Congress has already agreed to spending for this fiscal year and next under a previous agreement.
Ryan's proposal would overhaul Medicare for the next generation of seniors, boost defense spending beyond Obama's levels and slash most other domestic spending on college aid, food stamps and basic government investments. Tax rates for the wealthy would be cut to a top rate of 25%.
Twelve Republicans broke from the party to oppose the budget, many of them seeking deeper reductions than Ryan proposed. Even though Ryan's budget would repeal Obamacare, he relied on the taxes and savings in the healthcare law to reduce deficits.
Obama's budget, by contrast, would continue deficit spending for the next 10 years, raise taxes on the wealthiest 3% of households and fund priority programs, including expanded investments in education and infrastructure.
But in a sign of how difficult budget issues remain for lawmakers, a Democratic proposal that largely mirrored the president's approach was put to a vote Thursday and 31 Democrats opposed it.

[2024-05-24 00:08:11,659][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: WASHINGTON -- With little drama Thursday, House Republicans easily approved a largely symbolic budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., aimed at reversing the government's growing debt and deficits, but rejected several Democratic amendments that would have protected popular social programs.
The 2014 budget resolution, passed on a 221-207 vote, is not a binding spending bill and does not carry the force of law. Instead, it provides a vision for fiscal policy and sets the stage for further legislative battles over spending and taxes.
In contrast to previous years, when House Republican budgets faced intense opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans, this year's debate was more subdued. No Republican defected from party lines, while just two Democrats voted in favor of the resolution.

[2024-05-24 00:08:11,659][semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation: Ryan's budget, which aims to balance within 10 years by slashing federal spending, repealing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, and reining in Social Security benefits, was expected to pass narrowly along partisan lines.
