[2024-05-23 23:24:28,815][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

[2024-05-23 23:31:07,750][semstamp][INFO] - CONTEXT: Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First,ning a food safety crisis last year, followed by a norovirus outbreak that sickened hundreds in Virginia and now this. The company announced yesterday that it's been subpoenaed by the US Attorney's Office in California related to a federal criminal investigation into the handling of a small batch of tomatoes in California last summer.
According to Reuters, "The incident occurred at a single restaurant in Simi Valley, California, and was linked to a supplier that had provided bad tomatoes. Chipotle said it immediately took action to address the issue, including quarantining the affected produce and re-training staff on food safety procedures."
Chipotle told investors about the subpoena during an earnings call, saying they were cooperating fully with authorities. Company executives also acknowledged that the latest news is not helping their sales recovery efforts.
"We're doing everything we can to get our brand back on track," CEO Steve Ells said.
