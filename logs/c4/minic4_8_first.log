INFO - You passed a model that is compatible with the Marlin int4*fp16 GPTQ kernel but use_marlin is False. We recommend using `use_marlin=True` to use the optimized Marlin kernels for inference. Example: `model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(..., use_marlin=True)`.
INFO - The layer lm_head is not quantized.
