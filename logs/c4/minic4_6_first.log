[2024-05-24 00:03:41,194][__main__][INFO] - Prompt: A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain.
Sheila Thorns from Birmingham underwent a Caesarean section early this morning during which six children - four boys and two girls - were delivered.
Mrs Thorns gave birth two months prematurely - on her 30th birthday.
All the babies were placed in incubators after being delivered but one - a girl - died shortly afterwards while being given a blood transfusion.
Twenty eight medical staff from Birmingham Maternity Hospital were present at the delivery and the five surviving babies - Ian, Roger, Lynne, Julie and Susan - are now being cared for by a specialist team.
Doctors say around one birth in 3,000 million will result in sextuplets.
However, those odds were reduced for Mrs Thorns due to the fertility treatment she had been undergoing.
Her husband, Barry, said the couple had been aware of the possibility of having more than one baby.
Mr Thorns said: "We were expecting this multiple birth but we were stunned when we were first told that Sheila was likely to have five or six babies."
"We have wanted children all our married life," he added.
Over the past two years Mrs Thorns has been treated with gonadotrophin which contains two hormones known as FSH and LH.
The consultant treating her, Dr Cooke, said Mrs Thorns and several other women were unable to conceive until the proportion of LH was increased but that had resulted in a series of multiple pregnancies.
"We have had one set of triplets recently, and we know of some more who have not yet been born. I think we are going to have some more yet," he said.
But Dr Cooke believed the medical profession had learnt a lot about the effects of fertility drugs from those cases: "I think there is a real possibility that one day we shall be in a position to let a patient choose how many children she will have," he said.
Before 1938 multiple births were registered as separate events but it is believed around 18 sets of sextuplets have been born in the UK this century though it is unknown how many of them survived.
However, the anxiety is not yet over for the Thorns who have been warned by an obstetrician that more of the babies may yet die.
Three of the Thorns sextuplets survived.
The numbers of twins, triplets and other multiple births have soared in the years since fertility and IVF treatment became widely available.
The first case in Britain of a set of sextuplets surviving came with the births of Jenny, Ruth, Lucy, Kate, Hannah and Sarah Walton in 1983.
In November 1997 the world's first recorded case of surviving septuplets occurred when three boys and four girls were born to a couple in the United States.
In 1996 Mandy Allwood, a British woman on fertility treatment, gave birth to eight children - all died soon after delivery.
Since then births of octuplets have occurred in the US- when seven survived - and Italy - when six children survived.

[2024-05-24 00:09:43,430][__main__][INFO] - Watermarked Text: A woman has given birth to six babies in what is being hailed as the first recorded case of live sextuplets in Britain. The unnamed mother, who is from Manchester, had three boys and three girls weighing between 2lb 1oz and 3lb 14oz each. All six babies are reportedly healthy and well.
The delivery took place at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester on Friday. "This is a unique and exceptional case," said Dr Leighton Jackson, a consultant obstetrician at the hospital. "The risks associated with multiple births, particularly with sextuplets, are high. But thanks to the excellent care provided by our team, the mother and all six babies are doing remarkably well."
Sextuplets are extremely rare, occurring in only about one in every 13 million pregnancies. They often require specialist care from a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. In this case, more than 20 medical staff were involved in the delivery.

"We were all so excited when we heard that it was going to be sextuplets," said midwife Kathryn Gittins. "It's not something you see very often, but we were ready for it. We've been preparing for weeks."

The babies will need careful monitoring in the coming weeks, but their prognosis looks good. "They're all doing really well, considering they were born prematurely at 31 weeks," said neonatologist Dr Helen Murgatroyd. "
