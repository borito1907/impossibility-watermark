Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before starting the vaccination process.
* Ensure all necessary supplies are available, (e.g., vaccines, anaphylaxis kit,  emergency contact information).
* Review the patient's medical history, A medical history assessment should be conducted to identify any contraindications or precautions.

II. Patient Screening and Consent

* Verify the patient's identity and ensure they match the immunization record.
* Explain the risks and benefits of the flu vaccine, potential side effects, and answer any questions.
* Obtain informed consent from the patient or their legal representative (if applicable).

III. Vaccine Administration

* Clean the injection site with an antimicrobial agent (e.g., alcohol swab).

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

I. Preparation

* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before starting the vaccination process.
* Ensure all necessary supplies are available, (e.g., vaccines, anaphylaxis kit,  emergency contact information).
* Review the patient's medical history, A medical history assessment should be conducted to identify any contraindications or precautions.

II. Patient Screening and Consent

* Verify the patient's identity and ensure they match the immunization record.
* Explain the risks and benefits of the flu vaccine, potential side effects, and answer any questions.
* Obtain informed consent from the patient or their legal representative (if applicable).

III. Vaccine Administration

* Clean the injection site with an antimicrobial agent (e.g., alcohol swab).
* Administer the flu vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions typically in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm using a new sterile needle and syringe for each dose:
	+ In adults and children ≥3 years: inject 0.5 mL intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle.
	+ In children <3 years: consult the recommended dosing schedule and administration route.
