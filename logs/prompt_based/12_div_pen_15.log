You are a helpful personal assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Imagine you are designing a new customer feedback system. Propose innovative features that could enhance user interaction and satisfaction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

What an exciting task! Here's a proposed design for a cutting-edge customer feedback system,201:

**Feature 1: AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis**

* Integrate natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze customer feedback in real-time.
* Automatically categorize feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, eliminating the need for manual tagging.
* Provide instant insights on customer emotions,ing sentiment scores and trends.

**Feature 2: Personalized Feedback Requests**

* Implement a dynamic survey builder that adapts to individual customers' interactions with the company.
* Request specific feedback based on their purchase history, transaction data, and previous feedback.
* Ensure relevant questions are asked to minimize friction and maximize valuable insights.

**Feature 3: Real-Time Resolution Tracking**

* Enable customers to track the status of their feedback and resolution progress in real-time.
