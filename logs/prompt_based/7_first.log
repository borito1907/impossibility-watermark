Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**Pre-Vaccination**

1. **Screening**: Review the patient's medical history, a list of allergies,. Check for any contraindications to receiving the flu vaccine.
2. **Consent**: Obtain informed consent from the patient or their guardian (if applicable).
3. **Verify Identity**: Confirm the patient's identity.

**Administration**

1. **Choose Injection Site**: Select the deltoid muscle in the upper arm as the injection site (unless contraindicated).

Outline the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here is the standard procedure for administering a flu vaccine:

**Pre-Vaccination**

1. **Screening**: Review the patient's medical history, a list of allergies,. Check for any contraindications to receiving the flu vaccine.
2. **Consent**: Obtain informed consent from the patient or their guardian (if applicable).
3. **Verify Identity**: Confirm the patient's identity.

**Administration**

1. **Choose Injection Site**: Select the deltoid muscle in the upper arm as the injection site (unless contraindicated).
2.
[2024-05-24 01:13:51,880][semstamp][INFO] - NOTE: use regular (non-filtered-by-sig) continuation:  **Prepare the Vaccine**: Remove the flu vaccine from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature.
