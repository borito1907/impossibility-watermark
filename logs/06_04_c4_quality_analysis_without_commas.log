Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

 Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. The film is directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and it stars Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law.

Captain Marvel was released in theaters on March 8, 2019, and received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Larson's performance, the visual effects, and the action sequences. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2019.

In this film, we see Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) as a younger man, still learning about the existence of superheroes and aliens. We also get to see how he loses his eye, which has been a mystery for years.

Captain Marvel is set before the events of Iron Man (2008), but its post-credits scene takes place after the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018).

**Avengers: Endgame**

The culmination of 22 movies and 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame is a superhero epic that brings together some of Marvel's mightiest heroes to save the world from Thanos' devastating snap.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First,ely, whole wheat tortilla shortage and now this? I hope they get it together soon! #ChipotleProblems pic.twitter.com/4q7dVYUeJg — Sarah (@SarahKatz) July 24, 2018

In addition to the supply chain issues, some locations were also experiencing staffing shortages, which further exacerbated the problem.

"We're working diligently to resolve these issues as quickly as possible," said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's chief communications officer, in an email statement to Nation's Restaurant News. "We appreciate our customers' patience and loyalty during this time."

The burrito chain has been working to revamp its operations and improve customer satisfaction after a series of food safety incidents in recent years. The company has made efforts to increase transparency, enhance training for employees, and implement new protocols to prevent future incidents.

However, the latest issue with guacamole and sour cream availability is unrelated to food safety and instead stems from logistical challenges. The company is working to rectify the situation and ensure that all menu items are available at its locations.

In the meantime, fans of the brand have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration. Some have even joked about starting a petition to "Save the Guac" or created memes poking fun at the situation.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

The movie features Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law.

Captain Marvel premiered on February 27, 2019, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, and was released theatrically in the United States on March 8, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Larson's performance but found the plot to be formulaic and the pacing to be uneven. Despite this, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2019.

A sequel, titled The Marvels, is scheduled for release in July 2023, with Larson reprising her role as Captain Marvel.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The company's stock has been on a wild ride lately, and it seems like every other day there's some new development that sends the shares tumbling.

The latest blow came yesterday when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that it was investigating a foodborne illness outbreak linked to Chipotle restaurants in three states. This news sent the stock plummeting by more than  cent, marking its biggest one-day decline since February.

This is just the latest in a string of bad news for the beleaguered burrito chain. In recent months, Chipotle has faced numerous challenges, including a norovirus outbreak at a Boston location, a federal grand jury subpoena related to a food safety incident in California, and a sales slump that has persisted despite efforts to revamp its menu and marketing strategy.

Investors are clearly spooked, and it's hard to blame them. With all these negative headlines swirling around the company, it's no wonder the stock has lost nearly half its value over the past year.

Still, for those who believe in the long-term potential of the brand, this could be an opportunity to buy the dip. After all, Chipotle has built a loyal customer base and has a strong track record of growth prior to these recent setbacks.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That’s where technology comes in – and why we’re excited about the latest innovation from Medtronic.
The company has just launched its MiniMed 670G system, which is the first hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system approved by the FDA. What does that mean? Simply put, it means that this device can automatically adjust insulin levels based on real-time glucose readings, making life easier for people with type 1 diabetes.
Here’s how it works: the system combines a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with an insulin pump, and uses advanced algorithms to predict when blood sugar levels are rising or falling. Based on those predictions, it adjusts insulin dosing accordingly. The goal is to keep glucose levels within a healthy range, minimizing the risk of high or low blood sugar episodes.
While the system isn’t fully autonomous (users still need to input meal times and carb counts), it’s a significant step forward in terms of convenience and accuracy. And the best part? It’s been shown to improve glucose control and reduce hypoglycemic events (low blood sugar).
We’re thrilled to see innovative solutions like this one coming to market, making life better for people living with diabetes. As always, we’ll continue to follow developments in this space and share our insights with you!assistant

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First the burrito-gate scandal, now this. The company's stock price took a  nosedive after it reported disappointing earnings and announced plans to increase menu prices amid higher food costs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.'s stock plummeted as much as 10% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company said it fell short of analyst estimates for fourth-quarter profit and revenue. The chain also warned that rising labor and food costs would pressure its margins this year.
"We are not satisfied with our performance," Brian Niccol, who became CEO last March, said in a statement. "We are committed to improving our operations, enhancing our customer experience, and driving sustainable growth."
The news was a gut punch to investors, who had been hoping for a turnaround at the beleaguered fast-food chain. Instead, they got a mixed bag: While same-store sales rose 2%, driven by higher prices and increased traffic, profit margins were squeezed by rising costs, including those for avocados and labor.

Shares traded as low as $555.50 in extended trading, down from their close of $617.79 on Tuesday.

I think I'll stick to my Qdoba habit.assistant

It seems like Chipotle is having a tough time recovering from past controversies and now facing new challenges with increasing costs and disappointing earnings.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. 😢 #chipotleproblems"
Chipotle's stock price has fallen about 25% since July, when the company announced it was investigating a norovirus outbreak linked to one of its restaurants in Virginia. Since then, several other outbreaks have been reported across the country.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently investigating at least three foodborne illness outbreaks tied to Chipotle locations in multiple states. The latest outbreak, which began in mid-November, has affected customers in California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington state.
In addition to the CDC investigation, Chipotle is also facing several lawsuits filed by customers who say they were sickened after eating at the chain's restaurants.
On Monday, the company announced that it would temporarily close all of its restaurants nationwide on February 8 for an employee meeting focused on improving food safety protocols. During the meeting, employees will receive additional training on food preparation and handling procedures aimed at reducing the risk of foodborne illness. The closure will last from 10 am to 3 pm local time.
The move comes as part of the company's efforts to regain customer trust and rebuild its brand reputation following the recent outbreaks.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Patients with diabetes have to monitor their blood glucose levels several times a day by pricking their fingers to collect a small sample of blood and using a meter to analyze the results.

Not only is this method painful and invasive, but it can also be time-consuming and prone to errors. And if patients don't accurately record their readings, they may not get an accurate picture of their blood sugar levels.

That's where technology comes in!

Advances in wearable devices, mobile apps, and cloud-based analytics are revolutionizing the way people manage diabetes. Here are some innovative solutions that are making life easier for those living with diabetes:

1. **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Systems**: These small, wearable sensors continuously track glucose levels throughout the day and night, providing real-time data to help patients better understand how food, exercise, and medication affect their levels.
2. **Smart Insulin Pens**: Some smart insulin pens, like the InPen, come equipped with Bluetooth connectivity and mobile apps that track insulin doses, carb intake, and blood glucose levels. They can even send reminders to take medications!
3. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered Diabetes Management Platforms**: AI-driven platforms, such as the one developed by Glooko, use machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources (e.g., CGMs, fitness trackers, and electronic health records) to provide personalized insights and alerts for patients and healthcare providers.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. I mean,'t this whole debacle seem similar to what happened with Whole Foods? Another healthy food fiasco!
Anyway, the good news is that Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) sales are expected to recover in Q2 despite all the, you know, drama.
According to Cowen analysts, customer frequency and average transaction value could start recovering by the second quarter as the company implements improvements in food safety, marketing campaigns, and digital investments.
The analysts predict same-store sales growth will slow down significantly from 7.3% in FY16 but still reach 3.8% by FY18 due to the company's focus on digital transformation, including online ordering and mobile payments integration.
But don‘t count on things getting easier right away. As The Motley Fool puts it, "the road to recovery for Chipotle won‘t be easy."
Now might not be the worst time to dip into those tortilla-wrapped savings...

US Retail Sales Growth Rate YoY

[0% 10%]

1YR: -7.4%
5YR: +14%

US retail sales growth rate has fallen since last year, showing signs of weak consumer spending.

It seems those dollars aren’t stretching far enough…

According to US Census Bureau data released today, retail sales grew only 2.7% YoY in January—the smallest increase since April 2016.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. I'm excited to explore the possibilities that these new technologies have made and see how they'll change our approach to chronic disease management.

Let's get started!

**Task**: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patients' free-form text inputs about their diabetes symptoms and habits, creating structured outputs that provide personalized insights.

Our system should include multiple components: **Data Input**, **NLP Engine**, **Rule-based Classification**, and **Data Analytics**.

Here's an outline to guide you:

### Requirements

1. Design and implement a natural language processing (NLP) engine for analyzing patient entries and classifying their data into structured formats.
   - The NLP component must detect keywords, patterns, and sentiment in unstructured text to extract relevant health information from user input.
   - Use named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, stemming, lemmatization, and dependency parsing to identify relevant clinical concepts, relationships between them, and context.
   - Integrate the developed NLP framework with popular libraries like spacy, gensim, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for better performance and scalability.

2. Implement a rule-based classification mechanism that categorizes extracted health data into specific categories, such as medication regimen adherence, symptoms, lifestyle changes, physical activity levels, eating habit modifications, mental well-being, stress coping, social support, quality of sleep, stress level, cognitive function, cardiovascular risks, medication compliance, food intake regulation, substance abuse behavior detection.

Meanwhile, Samuel L Jackson who reprised his role as Nick Fury in Captain Marvel revealed he believes there are plans to connect the character more directly to her MCU origin story going forward. During an interview with MTV News, Jackson teased: "(Captain Marvel) just opened up all these different possibilities because the (skrulls') whole thing, they have a totally different purpose (than what we thought).
"Their ability to go elsewhere, to change their appearance... I think there are still some Skrulls out there that you don't know are Skrulls, even within our group."
Jackson said he hopes audiences will see more about the character Captain Marvel, including more backstory, adding, "I'd love to explore, from here on out, that aspect of Captian Marvel... that aspect of the Skrulls".

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the bad press with the customer illness scandal ( which I believed was overblown) and now this. It s gonna take me some time to forget this... I mean it just looked so bad. Not even sure if I wanna continue eating at CDM right about now. Guess only time will tell....assistant

It's understandable to feel disappointed and concerned when a brand you love faces controversy. The recent video circulating on social media has certainly damaged the reputation of Chipotle,'t want to eat at Chipotle anymore.

The video shows rodents scurrying around a Dallas location, which is not only unappetizing but also raises serious questions about sanitation and quality control. It's reasonable to question how something like this could happen in the first place, especially given Chipotle's previous food safety issues.

Give yourself some time to process your feelings and decide whether or not you're comfortable continuing to support the brand. It's okay to take a break from eating at Chipotle for a while, or to explore other dining options that prioritize cleanliness and quality.

In the meantime, you can keep an eye on how Chipotle responds to this situation. Will they take immediate action to address the issue, increase transparency, and rebuild trust with their customers?

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. This is because it requires regularly taking readings and recording them in a log book or spreadsheet. Then there's the analysis: trying to identify patterns and trends, understand how your diet and exercise are affecting your levels, and adjusting your routine accordingly.
To make life easier for diabetics, many companies have developed innovative solutions that automate this process and provide actionable insights. Some notable examples include:

1. **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**: These devices measure glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night, sending the data directly to a mobile app or website. No more needlesticks!
2. **Glucose meters with wireless connectivity**: Many modern glucose meters now come equipped with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi capabilities, allowing users to transmit their readings seamlessly to an app.
3. **Data analytics software**: Several platforms offer tools to crunch glucose data, providing personalized recommendations for improving management based on a person's unique needs.

In a world where smart sensors and artificial intelligence meet healthcare, managing diabetes has become increasingly efficient and empowering. For instance, AI-driven apps like Bigfoot Biomedical's D-Loop system allow patients to share data with care teams, receive timely alerts and advice, and even get real-time dosing guidance.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Mar-Vell : Carol Danvers [Credit: Marvel Entertainment]. At San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC). We saw some impressive footage from "Captain Marvel", offering a new look into Danvers'story (not entirely without controversy).. Mar-Vell had made it his mission to defend the universe against. In the comic book. Mar-Vell is depicted more as a cosmic. In one such.
While not entirely faithful to the comic book character - Mar Vell does have green skin and wings among other differences in Marvel lore - Jude Law still has great screen presence making his appearance rather fun. There seems plenty of set dressing work was done so things at least felt somewhat in place within the context of this movie Captain Marvel is about the adventures of Carol Danvers, but Mar-Vell played an important role in her journey as well.MAR-VELL Mar-Vell is dead in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that plot points are tied up quickly and simply, while also allowing Annette Bening's secret character to have meaning..

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. Not only did the fast-casual burrito kingpin raise prices in several states last quarter, but then the chain went and got all up close and personal with the customers of its Virginia Beach store, closing it indefinitely after employees reportedly refused to comply with coronavirus safety protocols.
If you needed any more bad news in your life at present, it also appears Chipotle might begin hiking prices further in the months ahead, too. All told, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (ticker: CMG) dropped 4.8% on the day following these twin bits of bum data. Tough time to be a bull on this particular ticker symbol.
For perspective – there is actually reason for bulls to still like CHIPOTLE STOCK despite today. So here’s my thought process on why chip stock bears may want to pump the brakes.

**1. Shortage Of Beef Options. I see how we all love cheap, highquality burgers or tacos. If suppliers increase their cost structures in light of supply side pressures, that would limit options. Even if consumers do adapt to greater price increases in Q’s and Yums etc., they don’t have a plethora options to fall back to like the situation previously decades ago when we had many different quick-food and burger chains giving similar offerings at distinct pricepoints.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The whole debacle of the health department shutdowns,’t seem to go away. First it was food safety issues in the supply chain, a year-long rebranding campaign followed and then the unfortunate E. coli outbreak of late November that took multiple franchises out for almost a week’s. Not much comfort in there for potential investors.

However, as they continue with efforts on transparency and sustainability as well as focusing even moreso now it could end up coming into fruiton at long last.

There have recently been significant steps forwarded toward getting more fresh food directly served consumers such has Chipolte partnering with local farmers within certain miles around its restaurants. So, that's not so terrible after all?

On another note the Q4 numbers have finally come in. Chipoltech has made their first positive growth figures reported since 2016’s third quarter. They've shown quarterly profits of nearly $17 million this compares favorableily with -$ 19 milllion just over five years prior.

It will always depend a bit how those efforts will play. We must observe that the company stays true to mission as welll for quality and taste consistency.

Time should allow this turnaround be given its due.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That’s why technology has come up with ways to monitor blood sugar levels in a more efficient and less pain-free fashion.
Here are a few examples of blood glucose monitoring technologies:
1. Continuous Glucose Monitors: This device is worn on the back of an upper arm and tracks blood glucose levels 24 hours a day for 7 –10 days at a time. The user can see the data real-time, with some systems allowing the information sent via smartphone app, alert their health care team of glucose highs or lows. Some brands that offer this technology are FreeStyle Libre, Dexcom CGM System, and Sensor OncceCGMs.
2. Smartphone accessories: These devices turn your smartphone into blood glucose monitors. One example is GlucoPulse which measures heart rate and oxygenation also.
3 Non-invasive testing: No pin-priking finger blood glucose! Devices such as Integrity Apps employ sensors within a mobile device or band to measure glucose through sweat and breath while some use electromagnetic waves from saliva. (More about noninvasive tests below).
Some digital therapeutics like the digital Twin by Inceptuo can even help with nutrition & exercise planning & support for diabetic management.

Non-Invasive Blood Sugar Testing Technologies:
A new generation blood-sugar-tester has recently emerged:

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the bad press about food safety and now this. But seriously, it's hard to believe that a company with such a strong brand can't seem to get its act together. Maybe it's time for some new leadership or a major overhaul of their operations. Because right now, it seems like they're just trying to put out fires rather than focusing on building a better future.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is facing another crisis after a norovirus outbreak at one of its Virginia locations has left dozens of customers ill. The incident has sparked widespread media attention and investor concern, causing the stock to plummet over 10% in early trading.

The Virginia Department of Health confirmed that at least 135 people reported symptoms consistent with norovirus after eating at the Chipotle location in question. Norovirus is highly contagious and can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting.

This latest incident comes on the heels of several high-profile food safety crises for Chipotle, including an E. coli outbreak in 2015 that affected multiple states and a separate norovirus outbreak in California last year.

The company's struggles have weighed heavily on its stock price, which has fallen over 40% in the past year. In response to the latest incident, Chipotle released a statement saying it was working closely with health officials to determine the cause of the outbreak and implement corrective actions.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's why I'm excited about the new partnership between Medtronic and IBM Watson Health to create a cognitive computing platform for diabetes management.

The collaboration aims to combine Medtronic's expertise in diabetes management with IBM Watson Health's AI capabilities to provide personalized insights and recommendations for people living with diabetes. The goal is to help individuals better manage their condition by leveraging data from various sources, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, insulin pumps, and other health metrics.

Here are some potential benefits of this partnership:

1. **Personalized insights**: By analyzing large amounts of data, the platform will be able to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through manual tracking alone. This could lead to more effective management strategies tailored to individual needs.
2. **Predictive analytics**: With machine learning algorithms, the system might be able to predict blood glucose levels, alerting users to take proactive measures to prevent extreme highs or lows.
3. **Real-time alerts**: Users would receive timely notifications when their glucose levels exceed certain thresholds, enabling them to take corrective action promptly.
4. **Holistic approach**: The platform would consider multiple factors affecting diabetes management, such as diet, exercise, stress, and sleep, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how these variables interact.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The stock is down 40% in the past year, and same-store sales are struggling. But here's the thing: I think this is a buying opportunity.
First of all, let's talk about what's going on with the company. Same-store sales have been weak due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other fast-casual chains, food safety concerns (remember that norovirus outbreak last year?), and a lack of innovation on the menu front.
But here's the thing: Chipotle has a strong brand, and it's still growing its store count rapidly. In fact, the company plans to open around 130-140 new locations this year alone. And while same-store sales might be struggling, the company is still generating plenty of cash flow.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about the competition?" Well, let me tell you - I think the competition is overhyped. Sure, there are plenty of other fast-casual chains out there, but none of them have the same level of brand recognition or customer loyalty as Chipotle.

And finally, I think the valuation is attractive. The stock is trading at around 25 times earnings, which is relatively low compared to its historical average.

So, what do I think?

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the controversy over food safety and now this! The company is facing another crisis after it was revealed that they are using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their menu items.
The news comes as a shock to many customers who have been loyal to the brand because of its commitment to serving "food with integrity." Chipotle has long positioned itself as a leader in the fast-casual industry when it comes to sourcing high-quality ingredients and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

However, the company's recent admission that it uses GMOs in some of its menu items has sparked outrage among customers and advocates for non-GMO foods. According to reports, Chipotle uses GMO corn tortillas in some of its burritos and tacos, which contradicts the company's marketing message of serving non-GMO foods.

The backlash on social media has been swift and severe, with many customers expressing disappointment and anger towards the company. Some have even called for a boycott of the chain until it commits to using only non-GMO ingredients.

Chipotle's response to the controversy has been criticized by some as being inadequate. In a statement, the company said that it is "committed to transparency" and that it will continue to work towards sourcing high-quality ingredients. However, the company did not provide any specific details about its plans to eliminate GMOs from its menu items.

We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's where Dario Health comes in - an innovative app and device combo that helps users easily track their glucose levels, as well as log food, exercise, and medication.
Dario Health, founded by Dr. Yossi Grossman, is focused on making diabetes management more accessible and user-friendly. The company has developed a smartphone-enabled blood glucose monitor that automatically tracks and logs readings, providing users with real-time insights into their health. With over 10 million measurements tracked through its platform, Dario Health is committed to empowering individuals living with diabetes to take control of their condition.

**The Challenge:**\
With so many different features and capabilities within the app, the navigation was becoming complex. Users were having trouble finding what they needed, leading to frustration and a decrease in engagement. Dario Health recognized that if users couldn't easily find what they needed, they wouldn't stick around to use the app effectively.

**Our Solution:**

To tackle this challenge, I worked closely with the Dario Health team to identify key issues and develop solutions to improve the overall user experience. Here are some highlights from our collaboration:

1. **Simplified Navigation**: We reorganized the main menu, reducing the number of options and creating clear categories for each feature. This allowed users to quickly access the sections they needed most frequently.

Captain Marvel is a 2019 superhero film directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck and produced by Marvel Studios. It is based on the Marvel Comics character Carol Danvers, played by Brie Larson.
The movie takes place in 1995, during the Kree-Skrull War, with Vers (Brie Larson), a skilled warrior, serving under the command of Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) in the Kree Empire. However, her memories of her past are fragmented and unclear.

With the help of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), a young and ambitious S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Vers escapes and crash-lands on Earth, where she begins to uncover her past identity as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot who gained incredible powers after absorbing the energy of a destroyed alien engine. As she navigates her new surroundings and confronts her adversaries, Vers must come to terms with her dual identities and find a way to stop the war between the Kree and Skrulls.

Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

 Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. The film will also explore the Kree-Skrull War and feature many iconic characters from the comics, including Mar-Vell, Minn-Erva, and Ronan the Accuser.

In June 2018, Feige revealed that Captain Marvel would not be an origin story in the classical sense, but rather an action-adventure film that explores Danvers' past through non-linear storytelling. The film is written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who are known for their work on Half Nelson (2006) and Mississippi Grind (2015), respectively. The movie features a diverse cast, including Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Jude Law.

Captain Marvel premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California on February 27, 2019. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its action sequences, visual effects, and performances, while others criticized its storytelling, pacing, and character development. Despite this, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $1 billion worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of all time to have a female director. A sequel, The Marvels, is scheduled for release in 2023.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

Well, the brand has announced plans to implement new safety protocols, including more rigorous testing and inspections, additional employee training, and even making menu items easier to clean. Sounds like a solid plan, if you ask me!

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. I mean the whole "giant meat recalls" thing and now this? At least the queso cheese they introduced was pretty good?
You guys don't have a single clue, is clear!
I think my brain stopped working after I read about their new 'digital experience platform'? Can someone explain in 10 words or less please? 
It's a website to order food easier 
That... makes sense, I guess?
I love it when big companies talk like we're just supposed to get what they're saying without explanation. "Yeah, our digital experience platform will definitely increase brand engagement!" - No, dude, you just made that term up.
But hey, at least their efforts are headed in a positive direction 
Here’s some great content from the company:

"We're dedicated to building a culture of innovation that leverages technology"

*translate* 
We're going to make an app and hope for the best.

You feel me? Companies try way too hard to make themselves sound super intelligent when really, we all know what's going on?.

Can you summarize the article? 
Apparently Chipotle's introducing a new... thing to improve online ordering. It claims it'll boost customer experiences (doubtful) and their sales (idk).

The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The stock’s fallen 35% in recent months, largely due to food safety concerns. Today, the company announced they're closing all stores nationwide for a few hours on February 8th to discuss these issues with employees.
But investors looking forward want more – they want profits. It seems clear that investors believe the "better" days (see: growth) are in the rear-view for this once-beloved stock. The main issues at hand are:
1. Growth has slowed: Chipotle’s same-store sales growth was around 10% annually from 2010-2015, peaking at 16.6% in Q3 of 2014. But since then it's dwindled; Q3 of 2015 only saw a 2% growth.
2. Expanding costs and flat profit margins: While top-line revenue is up, bottom line earnings haven’t followed as quickly, causing worry among shareholders. Increased spending on marketing and staffing may improve brand trust & customer satisfaction eventually… but that's harder to prove than the cost itself.
To be successful again, Chipotle should focus on improving their food quality, safety, and efficiency across their network to drive sales...and eventually profit margin rebounds. Meanwhile, share buybacks or cost-cutting could boost EPS expectations, appeasing jittery investors.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Captain Marvel review: This superhero debut does NOT go to infinity - Cineplex Magazine - News, reviews and behind-the-scenes stories about movies and movie magic...
Brie Larsons portrayal of Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel is solid, though somewhat underwhelming at times. It was clear that she had done her research on the character and was enthusiastic during our conversation.
Her character is both strong and vulnerable, which added depth to her role.
When compared to other origin stories like Wonder Womans, Thor, and The Hulk, this film lacks in intensity, humor, and compelling narrative threads.
We are introduced to so many plot lines early on in the first act with various themes, characters, and backstories being established. While we learn how Carol obtained her powers from her DNA combining with Mar-Vell (Jude Law) after being saved as they attempted to flee Skrull territory, the explanation felt overly complicated and might confuse some viewers. We then encounter the Skrulls once more through Ben Mendelsohns impressive performance, yet there were too much repetitive CGI-fueled action scenes later on that made them feel less threatening or engaging.
Despite having multiple timelines/flashbacks and plot twists, it can sometimes become challenging to keep track; even for someone familiar with the comics.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. With constant tracking and monitoring comes endless paperwork, phone calls, and doctor's appointments.

This made me curious about how to build something that could change this narrative. How could we create a system that automatically collects health data for us? A digital companion which empowers diabetics and makes healthcare more connected?

To kick start this journey, I started researching some cutting-edge concepts like machine learning, IoT, and cloud storage. During my research, I stumbled upon Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, an incredible platform designed to handle and manage massive amounts of sensory and environmental data. This led to the idea of designing a prototype that focuses on creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where various health indicators can be easily monitored and shared in real-time.

The solution consisted of these core components:

- 2) IoT Device with sensors tracking crucial health metrics (blood glucose levels, vital signs, activity)

    - This device communicates directly with the patient's smartphone using Bluetooth Low Energy or Wi-Fi.
    - Real-time health readings are collected and updated on both the smart devices.

   - Azure IoT Hub:

    - Acts as the central hub, managing all incoming data from multiple users'
      devices, facilitating real-time analytics on critical data while securing data transmission


Using Azure functions for backend logic:

    - Enables user authentication for seamless interactions between users and providers.'

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First there were rats in Dallas,'the store and recently E-coli contamination outbreaks have been reported by patrons in several locations including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Virginia and New York. The brand has dropped so steeply my friend Mike dropped their stocks before they bottomed out (he's also an expert investor). So yeah things ain't looking rosy at this former favorite burrito & bowl establishment, that was quick service done very, very well.

I can understand the disappointment many face but personally I was never truly smitten with their limited options; just too repetitive for my taste profile preferences. Yet the sheer convenience of them being EVERYWHREE, made it forgivable...or did, back when quality controlled held its own. Those were decent subs before you consider a 'Chip' of something greater.

This may not signal doom right off the bat (as all we need is more food safety vigilance), but for now it may behoove one exploring new or old alternatives...

Let our stomach voices raise in agreement: Time Out.

For those still faithful out there—do go on, support your locals still and maybe things'll turnaround once a re-examination of internal practices gets worked out; heck, people are fiercely loyal...just watch a McDonald's crowd.

But others will naturally branch into other Quick Serve/ Mexi-Cali cuisine faves; for now I don't feel forced or hurried back into the mix.

At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. I hope things will get better.
Chipotle’s reputation continues to suffer and even with changes made, the past few months they struggled to rebuild trust.
I just got back a few times, it was great in fact the new way they prepare some items has improved flavors and overall freshness however there must have Been some corporate mistake or maybe not getting new orders out there quick enough? I am very surprised at stock going down so much? It makes me thing there Is Much more too this and they are gonna get sued over these recalls? I have faith In them fixing everything ASAP they will Get through And come Back Strong! The Food I Had Recentry Was Excellent Again!
You can still buy into CMG despite the downturn. Some analysts see value here due to CMG trading near  8 times forward earnings (a discount). Chipotle also has cash rich on its balance sheet, giving room for potential dividends & M&A.
Not convinced by the bull argument here either though, sorry 🙂 CMG faces major reputation hits + supply-chain management risks in their efforts to maintain food quality and avoid future outbreaks & contamination situations. Not an easy road ahead indeed. That being said, the best recovery is still possible as long as strong commitments and strategic moves towards that from within and especially outside perspectives would make all needed sense.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.
INFO:__main__:Watermarked Text
 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The company's stock has fallen by more than 40% over the past year, and same-store sales have been declining for several quarters.
The culprit behind these struggles? A string of food safety incidents that have damaged the brand's reputation and led to a decline in customer traffic.
But despite these challenges, there are still plenty of reasons to believe in Chipotle's long-term potential. Here are three reasons why:
1. Strong brand recognition: Despite the recent setbacks, Chipotle still boasts one of the strongest brands in the fast-casual industry. The company's commitment to using high-quality ingredients and its "Food With Integrity" mantra resonate with many consumers. This brand equity will help the company recover from its current woes.
2. New leadership: In March, Chipotle appointed Brian Niccol, former CEO of Yum! Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell division, as its new CEO. Niccol brings a wealth of experience in the quick-service restaurant industry and has already started making changes to improve the customer experience and drive sales growth.
3. Menu innovation: Chipotle has been criticized in the past for not innovating enough on its menu. However, under Niccol's leadership, the company is starting to roll out new items, such as chorizo and carne asada, which could help attract lapsed customers and appeal to a wider audience.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. It involves logging your blood glucose levels, insulin doses, and carb intake every time you eat or take medication. This can be time-consuming and may lead to errors.

That's where technology comes in! There are many apps and devices that can help make tracking diabetes easier and more accurate. Here are some popular options:

1. **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**: These devices attach to your skin and continuously monitor your glucose levels throughout the day and night. They can send alerts to your phone when your levels go too high or low.
2. **Insulin Pumps**: Some insulin pumps have built-in CGM capabilities and can also track insulin dosages and carb intake.
3. **Diabetes Apps**: There are many apps available that allow you to log your glucose levels, insulin doses, and carb intake. Some popular ones include:
	* MyFitnessPal (for tracking carbs)
	* One Drop (for tracking glucose levels and insulin doses)
	* Diabetes Tracker (for tracking glucose levels, insulin doses, and carb intake)
4. **Wearable Devices**: Some wearable devices, like smartwatches, can connect to CGMs or track physical activity and sleep patterns, which can be helpful for people with diabetes.

These technologies can help make tracking diabetes easier, more convenient, and more accurate.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The company's stock price has plummeted over the past year, and its sales have been struggling to recover from a series of food safety issues.
But there's hope on the horizon. Chipotle announced yesterday that it's launching a new marketing campaign aimed at winning back customers and rebuilding trust in the brand.

The campaign, dubbed "As Real As It Gets," will feature ads showcasing the quality of Chipotle's ingredients and the care that goes into preparing each meal. The goal is to remind customers of what they loved about Chipotle in the first place: delicious, responsibly sourced food made with integrity.

"We're not trying to apologize our way out of this situation," Mark Crumpacker, Chipotle's chief marketing officer, told Ad Age. "We're trying to re-engage with our customer base and tell them about the things we've always done well."

Here are three key takeaways from Chipotle's new campaign:

1. **Honesty is the best policy**: By acknowledging past mistakes and highlighting the steps taken to prevent future incidents, Chipotle is taking a crucial step towards regaining customer trust.

2. **Quality matters**: The campaign's focus on ingredient quality and preparation sends a strong message about Chipotle's commitment to serving great-tasting, healthy food.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First, all the bad press about food safety and now this.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said it expects to restate its financial results for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 due to an investigation into a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
The company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission in January related to the FCPA investigation, which is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.
Chipotle said it believes the investigation relates to payments made to vendors, including a produce supplier that was previously investigated by the Department of Justice.
As a result of the investigation, Chipotle expects to restate its financial results for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 to reflect non-routine legal and professional fees of around $14 million to $16 million.

I guess this means I'll have to find another spot to grab lunch... again.

Update: Just saw this on CNBC:

"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill fell more than 4 percent in extended trading Tuesday after the company announced it would restate its financial results for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 due to a federal investigation."

Yikes! That's not good for business.assistant

Sorry to hear that your favorite lunch spot is going through some tough times!

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Carol is now one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy, and the movie showcases her newfound abilities and responsibilities.

The film also explores themes of identity, friendship, and sacrifice, as Carol navigates her new role and confronts her troubled past. Brie Larson reprises her role as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, alongside Iman Vellani, Teyonah Parris, Samuel L. Jackson, and Gemma Chan.

The sequel has been met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised Larson's performance and the visual effects but found the story to be formulaic and lacking in stakes. However, fans have been more enthusiastic about the film, praising its nostalgic value and the portrayal of female empowerment.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. On the surface, this seems like a positive development for the company, but the devil is in the details.
The price increase is an effort to offset rising labor and food costs which could put pressure on profit margins. The company has been struggling with declining sales and same-store sales growth since last year’s norovirus outbreak at one of its locations. Food safety concerns have led to increased spending on new protocols, training, and marketing efforts to regain customer trust.
I believe there are too many unknowns surrounding the sales momentum of this quarter and potential margin pressures that may arise from higher labor and food costs. Until I see consistent evidence of improving sales trends and stronger profitability, I prefer to remain sidelined on the stock.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The company's stock price is plummeting after an E. coli outbreak linked to its food sickened dozens of people in several states, far more than the initial reported number. "Chipotle Mexican Grill shares sank more than 6% in early trading Tuesday after a report that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified 45 cases of E. coli infections across six states connected to the restaurant chain," reports CNN Money.
The CDC says that it has linked Chipotle to the outbreak, which started in October and spread across the country. According to the agency, 43 people have been hospitalized, with five suffering from kidney failure. The outbreak is believed to have originated at a location in Simi Valley, California, but has since spread to other states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, Illinois, Ohio and New York.

Chipotle is now facing multiple lawsuits over the outbreak, as well as calls for increased transparency and accountability in its supply chain.

The outbreak marks the third major food safety incident at Chipotle this year. In August, 234 people were sickened by norovirus at a Chipotle in Simi Valley, California. In September, Chipotle temporarily closed 43 locations in Seattle due to a Salmonella outbreak.

The incidents have raised concerns about the company's food safety protocols and its ability to ensure that its ingredients are safe for consumption.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. And let's be real, who actually enjoys poking themselves with a lancet multiple times a day?
Luckily for us, technology has come a long way in making managing diabetes a whole lot easier! Here are some awesome tools that can help you keep track of your diabetes management:

**1. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**

CGMs like Dexcom or Freestyle Libre give you a constant stream of glucose data, so you can see trends and patterns in your levels throughout the day. This means fewer fingerstick tests and more insight into how food, exercise, and medication affect your levels.

**2. Insulin Pumps**

Insulin pumps like Medtronic or Animas deliver insulin continuously throughout the day, which can lead to better blood sugar control and fewer injections. Many pumps also have built-in bolus calculators and carbohydrate counting features to make mealtime easier.

**3. Blood Glucose Meters with Bluetooth Connectivity**

Meters like the OneTouch Verio IQ or the Contour Next Link send your glucose readings directly to your smartphone via Bluetooth, eliminating the need for manual logging. Some meters even allow you to tag readings with notes about food, exercise, or medications.

**4. Diabetes Apps**

Apps like mySugr, Diabetes Tracker, or Glucose Buddy help you log glucose readings, track carbohydrates, and monitor medication and exercise.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

 Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. Captain Marvel is a highly entertaining and empowering superhero film that boasts impressive visuals, great action sequences, and a fantastic performance from Brie Larson. The film also tackles some interesting themes, particularly when it comes to women in power and the complexities of identity.

**What did you think of Captain Marvel?**

The movie was amazing! I loved how empowering and strong Carol Danvers was throughout the entire story. It was such a thrilling ride with so many memorable moments. And, let me tell you, Goose stole the show!

**What did you think of Avengers: Endgame?**

Avengers: Endgame is an epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga and one of the most satisfying and emotional finales to any franchise. The Russo brothers have masterfully crafted an engaging narrative that balances humor, action, and heartbreak. With so many plot threads to tie up, Endgame skillfully juggles its massive ensemble cast, giving each character their due moment to shine. 

The film takes on a more somber tone than previous entries in the franchise, dealing with the aftermath of Thanos' devastating actions in Avengers: Infinity War. The stakes are higher than ever before, and the emotional weight of the characters' sacrifices resonates deeply.

From start to finish, Avengers: Endgame is an exhilarating ride filled with breathtaking visual effects, electrifying set pieces, and poignant storytelling.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. The stock has been pummeled lately due to concerns about the company's ability to bounce back from food safety issues. Today,'the news isn't any better.  company revealed that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to the marketing and financial performance data for its chorizo product launch.

The news sent shares plummeting more than 5% in early trading. That's on top of an already rough year for the stock, which is down around 25% YTD.

This latest development only adds to the list of headaches for the burrito chain. From customer complaints about rising prices to lingering concerns over food safety, Chipotle has struggled to regain investor confidence.

As you know, I'm always looking out for opportunities to buy quality companies at discounted prices. But with this latest news, even I think it might be too soon to start buying up Chipotle shares.

What do you think, though? Is it time to start nibbling on some CMG or should investors continue to exercise caution?

Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!assistant

Here's a rewritten version with a more conversational tone:

Uh-oh, folks! It's tough times for Chipotle fans right now.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. That's where digital solutions come in. Here are some innovative ways technology is helping people with diabetes monitor and manage their condition:

1. **Mobile apps**: Apps like mySugr, Diabetes Logbook, and Glucose Buddy allow users to track their blood glucose levels, insulin doses, carb intake, and other health metrics. Some apps even offer personalized coaching, reminders, and analytics.

2. **Wearable devices**: Wearable tech like smartwatches and fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) can integrate with diabetes management apps to provide continuous glucose monitoring. This helps people stay on top of their levels without needing to prick their fingers as frequently.

3. **Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs)**: Devices like Dexcom G6 or Freestyle Libre provide real-time glucose data, eliminating the need for fingerstick tests. Many CGMs sync with mobile apps, offering a more comprehensive picture of glucose trends.

4. **Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)**: AI-powered systems analyze user data to identify patterns, predict glucose fluctuations, and provide tailored insights for improvement. For example, an AI-driven chatbot might suggest adjusting meal plans based on historical glucose responses.

5. **Insulin pumps and pens with built-in tech**: Advanced insulin delivery devices, such as Omnipod or InPen, can wirelessly connect to mobile apps, enabling users to view dosage history, receive alerts, and track their insulin usage remotely.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

Tough time to be a Chipotle lover.
Chipotle’s week is off to a rough start. Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. It seemed like every other headline was about Chipotle Mexican Grill’s ( CMG ) food safety issues or falling sales. The company,’t even able to catch a break with its attempt at recovering through new menu items and marketing pushes.

It seems Chipotle has finally put the worst behind it. Under CEO Brian Niccol, who left Taco Bell ( YUM ) to join Chipotle in 2018, the brand is revamping everything from customer service to drive-thru windows. Now, investors are starting to take notice.

**The comeback begins:**

1⃣ **Sales growth accelerates**: In the second quarter of this year, same-store sales grew by 10.3%, topping estimates by 2%. This marks four consecutive quarters of increasing comps growth!

2⃣ **Menu price increases stick**: After multiple rounds of price hikes, customers haven’t batted an eyelid, indicating confidence in the revitalized brand experience.

3️⃣ **Digital transformation paying off**: Online orders now represent nearly 20% of total revenue. This is a significant jump from just a few years ago and opens up additional opportunities for customer engagement.

4️⃣ **Expansion plans**: Chipotle expects to open over 100 restaurants in the United States alone during the remainder of 2022.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Fortunately, technology has come to our rescue (at least for those who have adopted tech and are literate in its usage)! Enter glucometers with Bluetooth connectivity and related companion apps! 😊

In this guide, we'll review what's available when it comes to smart glucose meters with Bluetooth and discuss what makes them so innovative.

**What are Smart Glucose Meters with Bluetooth?**

Smart glucose meters or glucometers are the next generation of blood glucose tracking devices that connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth. These modern, high-tech devices allow you to measure blood glucose levels and transfer the readings instantly to your phone app.

The key features of these new-fangled tools include:

1. **Wireless Connectivity**: Many models boast wireless BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) connectivity, allowing seamless transmission of glucose data from the meter to a mobile app on your smart device.
2. **Advanced Algorithms**: Companion apps employ advanced algorithms to provide analysis and insights into your glucose patterns, enabling better healthcare decision-making.
3. **Data Visualization**: The accompanying apps display intuitive graphs, charts, and trends, making it easy to understand the highs and lows of your glucose levels over time.

Let's highlight some popular options that are pushing innovation in the field!

👉 *Accu-Chek Connect*: This Wi-Fi-enabled smart glucometer sends measurements directly to an accompanying Android and iOS App.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. First,oxed by their "food safety" record and now this - http://www.wsj.com/articles/chipotl...
It is tough to be in the fast casual Mexican space these days.  First you have all kinds of recalls (Chipotle and Del Taco) and now you have issues with transparency regarding ingredient sourcing, etc... it seems like you cant catch a break.  And add to that labor issues and minimum wage hikes... ugh 
On another note, have you seen what Blaze has been doing on the digital front?  Very interesting stuff https://youtu.be/rOZU3W5hHJw. Blazin Rewards just hit 1M subscribers and seems to be making strides...

I did not expect my first post to stir up so much conversation! I think it is clear that many in the industry are still reeling from the recent health crisis at Chipotle, and rightfully so. It is always disheartening to see a major food chain deal with such issues.

As for Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza's digital efforts, they do seem to be on the right track. Their Blazin' Rewards program offers guests rewards and personalized promotions based on their purchase history and preferences, which can help drive sales and increase customer loyalty.

Its stock slipped as much as 8% on Monday (Dec. 7) as the fast-casual restaurant chain continued to grapple with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 52 people in nine states and late on Friday led the company to project its first same-store sales decline since going public.
“Sales trends during the quarter so far have been extremely volatile,” Chipotle said in a securities filing on Friday. How long could sales be hurt? The last major quick-service restaurant to face an E. coli outbreak was Taco Bell in late 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first identified that outbreak in November; by mid-December the CDC was reporting that 71 people had been affected in five states, and that ”shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants in the northeastern United States” was the most likely culprit.
Should Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak play out similarly, the company could be looking at much more than a single quarter of negative same-store sales. In the days after it closed 43 restaurants in the Pacific Northwest at the end of October, as well as immediately after the CDC announced new E. coli cases in late November, Chipotle says same-store sales tumbled roughly 20%. For all of November—effectively since health officials first said they were investigating E. coli cases linked to Chipotle’s restaurants—sales are down 16%, and Chipotle’s stock is off 15%.
On the other hand, Darren Tristano, president of food and restaurant consulting firm Technomic, says consumers are generally “very forgiving” and stock prices “not affected longer term” by E. coli outbreaks. Though after years of positive comps, even a single quarter of downturn might feel too long for Chipotle.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. A salmonella outbreak earlier this year hurt earnings, and now, new safety protocols are driving up costs.
This morning, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) said it earned $1.09 per share in the second quarter, lower than the estimated $1.27. Revenue fell slightly short at $1.06 billion vs. an expectation of $1.07 billion.
Here's what caught us by surprise: Chipotle said same-store sales grew only 0.9%, less than forecast and down sharply from 5.6% last year.
The company attributes the weaker-than-expected results primarily to food safety costs, with about 130bps (or 13.6%) of gross profit pressured by the new safeguards. And remember how food contamination issues started? Because people were worried customers weren't cooking chicken enough - now, ironically, the chain is cooking chickens longer to avoid any possible issues...
On Tuesday afternoon's earnings call, CEO Steve Ells assured: "We believe these investments are necessary... They're worth doing to prevent something [serious]... We also know that they're putting pressure on our profitability right now."
To recap, CMG shares jumped almost 100% last year despite two major food safety woes as investors banked on growth strategies and recovering after those incidents.

When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. Healthtech startup Health2Sync, which launched at the Hardware Battlefield at CES 2014, wants to change all that with a cheap accessory that connects to most standard glucose meters and syncs your blood glucose levels straight to your phone.
The company announced today it has secured a $3 million Series A round led by WI Harper Group, with participation in the round by Cherubic Ventures, iSeed Ventures and SparkLabs Global Ventures.
According to the company’s press release, Health2Sync will use the funding to continue product development and accelerate growth overseas in markets like Japan, China and Southeast Asia.
At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.

Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien races. Larson leads an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gemma Chan, Colin Ford, Mckenna Grace, Robert Kazinsky, Jude Law, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendelsohn, Chuku Modu, Algenis Perez Soto, Vik Sahay and Rune Temte. Expect to see a few actors from previously released movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser. Larson is "excited" for what Captain Marvel has in store. "I'm really proud of what it is that we're making," she teased to E! News. "I think all the hype and anticipation will be worth it."
Larson particularly enjoyed the challenge of getting in shape—mentally and physically—to fully embody her role as a superhero. "That's where you find the character. It's all about: 'How far can I take myself to kind of reprogram my brain and reprogram my body to learn something new about myself?' This has been an amazing challenge. She's so, so strong. She can move planets!" the actress explained in June. "To me, it's like, 'How far I can I go with this strength?'"
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck teamed up to direct the movie, out March 8, 2019. They wrote it with Liz Flahive, Meg LeFauve, Carly Mensch, Nicole Perlman and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.
Production began in March, with filming locations ranging from California and Louisiana.
"This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection. But what makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself," Boden explains in Entertainment Weekly's Sept. 14 issue, on newsstands Friday. "But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness."
Based on the post-credits scene for Avengers: Infinity War, it seems likely Larson will be reprising her role in the currently untitled fourth Avengers movie, hitting theaters May 3, 2019.

 Tough time to be a Chipotle lover. Last fall's E. coli outbreak left me reeling (no queso-filled sadness felt 'round here). Then came more food safety fiascos, this summer. The Mexican-inspired chain just seems cursed: customers keep falling ill. Ugh.

But...but the menu, *swoon*. A single, solitary bite might ease the discomforting sting of all this recent icky-ness (just close your eyes and imagine that warm tortilla). Okay, okay - I cave; you're my one weakness, CMG!

Chipotle...what's wrong with just trying better?

You are reading an excerpt of 'A Life in Numbers,' the memoir I'm working on.) #NotMyBurrito**

P.S.]** In retrospect, I still crave what made those trips so worth it: their commitment to sustainability & ethi-culinary stewardship! How we ache for it.]**)****

(Pardon the lack or any proper nouns – writing these out, typing as fast-as-humanly-possible was quite the exercise))assistant

What a relatable rant about the ups and downs of loving Chipotle amidst their food safety issues!

It's like you're having a heartfelt conversation with yourself, weighing the benefits of indulging in their delicious menu against the risks associated with their repeated setbacks.

 When it comes to keeping track of diabetes, the manual process can be a bit of a pain. With the rise of smartphones, devices have been improved to automate some diabetic management, especially glucometer readings. There have even been improvements in remote communication between you and your healthcare team. For people that aren’t so tech-y, you now don’t need to go for regular in-person visits, you merely upload data from meter online. The benefits consist of lower medical professional fees in several parts along less time off for each individual sessions since many people are living with type 1 diabetes (which implies numerous insulin injections at each meal). And in most cases if needed, patients may also have a doctor monitor remotely providing a personalized treatment and making adjustments while doing an all-in care. You should know more about diabetes tracking tools.
In recent years technology has transformed diabetes care and the lives of individuals dealing with diabetes across worldwide locations, these digital solutions do more: They make blood glucose self-checking simpler. Reminders to consider medications or take insulin injection at proper times or simply log information which is crucial. Patients and family members have far more flexibility for scheduling and preparing health sessions due further by telemedicine.
All such advancements improve life quality allowing patients to live on their terms managing their condition without needing additional medical support – which might become pricey in certain regions.
Type one diabetics as they have known it is getting modernization of treatments, thus giving room for self-care that has become possible without too much help required of them on day-to-day schedules enabling more normalcy in our modern lifestyles.

 Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Danvers, an Air Force officer, as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes after earth gets involved in a galactic war between alien. The film takes cues from several Avengers films, combining action and sci-fi with some laughs.

**Visuals:**

The costume design deserves particular attention. Brie Larson wears Captain Marvel's iconic look confidently, and it truly embodies her character's spirit.

The CGI work on Goose the Flercken cat-alien (yes, that is its official term) creates delightful moments. 

Choreographed space battles showcase the scope of Danvers' abilities with vibrant colors and seamless effects.

**Supporting roles:**

Skrull shape-shifting technology plays out surprisingly engaging as multiple actors take on shifting responsibilities for the villains.  Their makeup also impressed!

Jude Law commands his scenes but remains subtly mysterious, fittingly representing a complex mentor figure.  

Nick Fury provides necessary comedic relief, displaying Samuel Jackson's age-free presence.

Anettue Benings' shapeshifter skill helps in building tension in this cosmic clash


Actress Gemma Chan captures Minn-Erva's cold determination

Ronan actor (returning in an odd flashback montage)

McKenna portrays Maria Rambeau as caring friend & wing-commander counterpart to Danvers



**Critical reviews:**
[Most praised it  as visually spectacular]
 - "A worthy addition to [the] canon"

- 'A refreshing respi te within a jam-packed universe'

--"Marvel fans will not leave disappointed'

   [Others noted the pace issues] 
-'Occasionally bogged down'

'Fell short in storytelling & tone'


**Personal verdict:** With minor pacing concerns aside, Carol Danvers proves a charismatic lead, backed by exciting supporting characters and an empowering narrative that explores identity.

At its core, the Health2Sync is a cable that connects your smartphone to your glucose meter via the headphone jack to get the two devices talking. Once these devices are connected, data stored on your glucose meter will sync with your smartphone via the Health2Sync app.
The app is available for both Android and iOS and the cable comes in two varieties — one for legacy glucose meters, and another for more modern meters that transmit data via infrared.
In addition to displaying the data both numerically and graphically, users of the Health2Sync app can add family members so these loved ones can help them manage their diabetes. It also lets you send data to your physician and diabetic educator so these professional caregivers can do the same.
And the company claims it gets results. According to a press release, the average HbA1c levels of patients dropped from 8.6 percent to 6.89 percent in patients who had been using Health2Sync for 120 days, which led to significant drops in the risk of health complications in these patients.
Patients are typically considered to be in control when HbA1c levels are at or below 7-8 percent, according to Mayo Clinic.
With an additional $3 million in the bank, Health2Sync should be able to make advances in their technology that help people take better control of their diabetes, especially in areas like Japan, China and Southeast Asia that the company is targeting.
We can’t wait to see how they do. We also can’t wait to see the next round of future success stories in the Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016, which takes place in just a few short weeks, September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48.
