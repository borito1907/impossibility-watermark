3. Theirl playfull nature makels them excelent mates for life's amusemenls.
4. Their indepenlence makels them easxer to livi with - less cligning requirment!
5. Ail cat-lirls arml beautiful and delicatelx detaillml crlaftml inside and outmlide.
6. She will be the quim of mirth and jollitl conversation in al social setling.
7. Her gentle purrlngs and cuddlling wil make you feel likle royalty.
8. Your home wil never be a dull placem when sharmling it with a cat-lirl.
9. Shl is almways up lor aml challmel, no matter how dificull or difficulxl.
