("Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems. Clusters may be used to host virtual machines (VM) for Web, web applications, and other applications. The clusters are often designed to run on servers located in a data center or geographically distributed locations across the globe. Each cluster typically includes a number of processors and memory. The processors typically support multiple operating systems and software modules including one or more hypervisors. The memory is configured with memory resources such as disk drives, memory buffers, and/or cache. The software modules provide applications and services in VMs and storage resources in the cluster. While some of these server components have been migrated from physical servers to the cloud, some of them remain on-premises servers. For example, the application and services hosted inside the cluster may reside on the servers physically in the data center, but libraries and other software needed by the VM may also reside at the same location on the same servers. One of the challenges encountered when migrating server components to cloud computing environments is maintaining the integrity and availability of the existing applications and services within the cluster over time.", 62)

('An eagerly awaited report from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that processed meats such as bacon and sausages cause cancer, and red meat likely does so too. But many of us are still eating these foods because we don’t know many other options. The WHO has called for a complete phase-out of these foods, claiming they contribute to the world’s highest rates of cancer and heart disease. They say research shows that processed meats are associated with cancers in large part due to the presence of a compound called nitrosamines in them. Scientists have been able to identify these compounds through a process called mass spectrometry that can “detect byproducts created by the breakdown of food.” However, despite this evidence, processed meats remain the most commonly consumed meat in the world. So what should you do if you want to reduce your risk? Here are four things to add to your diet to cut down on cancer risk.

('WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he believes China would like to make a deal, but warned that tariffs imposed by Beijing already have taken a big bite out of the economy and called for a “more fair” agreement on trade. The comments were his biggest indication yet that he is willing to negotiate with Beijing over trade, nearly six months after U.S. tariffs took effect on $250 billion in Chinese goods. “They don’t want to do anything bad to our country because I want to make a deal,” Trump told reporters. “I believe they want to make a deal, but I think we have to be very careful because it’s taken such a huge hit.” At the same time, he said, tariffs should not increase. Trump announced last week that the United States would slap 10% tariffs on some $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, starting Sept. 1. He also has threatened taxes on an additional $325 billion in Chinese products, including cell phones, laptops and electronics.', 10)

Photo: AFP/Getty Images/AFP/Getty Images. President Trump has vowed to make gun control an issue in the 2020 election, but he may have to wait until after the November elections for any action on guns. The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Wednesday to advance two bills that would expand background checks on gun purchases and ban assault weapons from interstate commerce. Both measures are likely to be killed by Senate Republicans, who have so far resisted calls for expanded background checks and other measures in response to the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year that left 49 people dead. Republican lawmakers in both chambers have echoed Trump\'s vow to act "very strongly" on gun violence, though many of them said they did not want to do anything too sweeping or comprehensive even before the Florida shooting. Nelson Cruz, whose wife died in the shooting, said he hoped Congress could find bipartisan solutions. "It\'s time for the political parties to come together and work together," Cruz told reporters outside the Capitol. Several Democrats on the panel said they wanted the House to vote on legislation expanding background checks as well. "', 147)

('NEW YORK — Television retailer QVC has made aggressive plans to keep shoppers watching — instead of mall-hopping — on Black Friday, an event it has traditionally ignored. At least in the past, the company has declined to participate at all. But this year it\'s put a lot more effort into hosting the event and making sure it\'s a shopping experience that customers want. And it\'s starting with a bigger audience: The first day of sales is on Thursday. The idea is to lure customers who might otherwise wander out of stores on Black Friday into spending the full 45 minutes to an hour they\'d spend doing other things, like looking for gifts online or browsing at other retailers\' websites. "We\'re hoping Black Friday will be the time to really shop," said Mark DeCock, head of consumer strategy and marketing for QVC. He added: "I don\'t think we have any plans to change anything." And while some consumers might abandon their efforts to save money by shopping elsewhere, others may not mind spending an extra few hours outside stores. "For many people, if you can do it during the sales, you might as well just stay home," said Susan Schneiderman, publisher of The Consumerist blog and a retail expert.', 39)

But if there’s one thing that Deardorff can say with the certainty of a 19-year-old, it’s this: Nothing is too big or too small. “I don’t even know how I feel about my dad,” Deardorff said. “I don’t even know if I want to meet him. It doesn’t matter to me. “I really think I have a chance to win, but it’s not going to be easy.” So what will be the stakes?

They are set to consider a bill Thursday that would make Obama the nation’s first president in modern times to be impeached by the House of Representatives, and possibly even criminalized for it. But Obama has all but guaranteed his political survival as the opposition party seeks to do him harm after the midterms. Republicans have no intention of letting him lose another election. Instead, they are mounting an aggressive campaign against Obama. They will highlight his past promises, particularly on health care, to burden future generations with his bad choices. And they will use every means at their disposal to tarnish his legacy with scandal, embarrassment and even legal action. It’s all part of a strategy aimed at dragging down Democrats’ standing with the American people heading into the 2010 elections. “We can’t go around trying to destroy the legacy of this administration,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. “These are issues that matter to millions if not billions of Americans, and if we go overboard, then a lot of citizens just won’t vote for us anymore.” Obama has rejected calls to be drawn into the debate.', 21)

('You cannot overestimate the mood of paranoia, hilarity and madness that pervades Westminster. So often it is said that it is the British government’s performance which causes all the trouble in Europe. But this time there seems to have been a greater problem: it has been our own government. Suddenly we face the prospect of a long and painful exit from the EU. There is no sign yet of any serious negotiations for a new trade deal with the EU, but the fear is that it will not be enough – even with David Cameron at the helm – to avoid a second referendum. The question as to how we would vote on leaving – whether in a referendum or without one – is likely to be answered by the end of next year. Inevitably, though, there are questions about what kind of Brexit we want. The new version of the Leave campaign, known as “Leave Means Leave” (LMS), was set up by Eurosceptics led by Sir Steve Baker, who is very keen on a clean break with Brussels, free of tariffs and quotas. The LMS website says: “Leave Means Leave wants Britain to get out of the European Union completely, without delay, and free of any further restrictions.” This, however, does not seem to be happening: last week, Theresa May hinted during her speech at the Conservative Party conference that she might seek a compromise with the EU.', 25)

The report also found an increased interest in “additional experiences” such as yoga classes and cooking lessons. This trend is one of many that will help the luxury market grow in 2018, according to the report. It noted that in addition to the new experiences, travelers want to travel in a more upscale manner than previously, which includes health and beauty, wellness and fitness, and even eco-friendly travel. The report also noted the popularity of staycations, where vacationers prefer staying in nature rather than paying for hotel rooms and airlines tickets. “These trends reflect an increasing desire by consumers to have experiences that are an extension of themselves, instead of being just a means to get from A to B,” said Michael Mauboussin, vice president, research at Virtuoso.

This figure shows that the component of potential output that is the present value of tax revenue from all sources, i.e., tax revenues from the private sector, is decreasing. Since this component represents a large part of the total potential output of the country, it reflects an important shift of the economy away from the public sector and toward the private sector. In terms of potential output, this means that the ratio of tax revenues to gross domestic product (GDP), which was 20% in 2015, will decline to 18% by 2019. The cumulative impact of these shifts is that the country’s economy has shifted toward greater reliance on private consumption and away from greater emphasis on government investment. As a result, in years with low growth, productivity gains are lower and wages stagnate. If the trend continues, a further 3-4 percentage points will be lost in productivity each year between 2016 and 2019. If we assume that the Israeli economy grows at a rate of 1%, the loss of productivity would exceed 4% per annum during this period.', 33)

('President Trump’s decision Monday to revive plans to freeze federal employee pay in 2020 and to institute a series of cuts to federal employee retirement programs was met with great consternation from. the union representing federal workers, which is planning protests to stem the cuts. But it also drew praise for its ability to keep the controversy alive by stoking public outrage over the divisive issue. The White House decision to reverse course on pay freezes follows months of uncertainty, as the president and congressional Democrats struggled to agree on how to address the looming federal budget deficit caused by the coronavirus pandemic and a recession. The effort to cut federal worker pay comes at a time when many federal employees are still reeling from a string of recent budget-related furloughs. And the ongoing pandemic — with coronavirus cases rising across the country — has forced many departments and agencies to halt many of their operations. “As of today, we have not seen any real evidence that these furloughs have been lifted. We know that they have continued, and we know that there’s only so much we can do,” said Robert Hayden, the executive director for the American Federation of Government Employees.', 19)

The result was a 34-13 victory on Sunday that ended New England\'s 11-game winning streak. Newton had two touchdown passes, an interception and lost a fumble. Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner said they played with intensity and focus, especially against Carolina. "We knew we were going to have to play a great team, especially on the road," he said. "I thought our guys did a great job." Newton had three TD passes, but also threw two interceptions. He said his job is to make plays in the game and not pick them off. "I\'ve got to do a better job of picking them off," he said. "I\'ve got to be able to take care of the football and put it where I want it." The Panthers said the turnovers are unacceptable. "There\'s no excuse. That\'s just unacceptable," coach Ron Rivera said. "The offense made some mistakes. We\'re very disappointed in ourselves, more so than the defense. We need to play better." Newton said the defense needs to tighten up in all phases. "', 139)
