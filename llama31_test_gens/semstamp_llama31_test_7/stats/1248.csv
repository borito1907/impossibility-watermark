Yo, it's been a minute since I've been in the game,
And now I'm back with a tale of culinary shame,
I'm talkin' 'bout a beverage that's gone bad, son,
 Spoiled milk, the breakfast drink that's never won.

(Verse 1)
Yo, it's been a minute since I had a snack that was whack,
Poured myself a glass of milk, straight from the pack,
Didn't check the date, just assumed it was fresh,
Now my stomach's doin' flips, what a mess,

The smell hits me first, like a punch in the face,
I'm talkin' sour and curdled, ain't no time to waste,
Got a sip, got a gulp, then I spit it out fast,
Feelin' like a fool, this milk's gone past its cast,

Got my eyes on the clock, waitin' for it to pass,
Antacid in my hand, tryin' to calm the blast,
My gut's protestin', doin' flips and all that jazz,
Wish I woulda checked the expiration, now I'm feelin' quite flat,

(Chorus)
Spoiled milk, it's a dirty trick,
 Made me sick, now my belly's gonna flick,
Felt like a pro, but played by the carton,
Spoiled milk, got me goin' down hard, yeah!

Yo, it's your boy Slim Shady back with the skills so sick,
Got a story to tell that'll make you feel quite thick,
'Bout a decision I made that was oh so whack,
Drankin' some milk that had been left on the attack,

I saw it sittin' there, all alone and blue,
Expired since January, but I thought ""what's new?""

Yo, it's been a minute since I had a good rhyme,
But now I'm back with a tale that's simply sublime,
'Bout a drink so foul, it'll make you wanna puke,
I'm talkin' 'bout spoilin' the game with some curdled juice,

It was midnight, and my stomach was growlin',
Reached for the fridge, didn't care if it was bowlin',
Grabbed the 2% carton, didn't check the date,
Thought to myself ""What's the worst that could await?""

Yo, listen up, 'cause I'm about to spit some fire,

Yo, it's your boy Slim Shady, back with another track that's whack,
'Bout a decision I made, and now my stomach's on attack,
I was rummagin' through the fridge, lookin' for somethin' to drink,
 Found a carton of 2%, but the expiration date was a blink,

In the past, by weeks, maybe more, didn't give a darn,
 Thought to myself, ""What's the worst that could happen, man?""

Yo, it's your boy Slim Shady, back with another tale,

Yo, 'bout to spit some fire that's gonna make you feel ill,
'Bout the horrors of dairy, and the risks I'd take still,
Got a carton in my fridge, been sittin' for weeks,
Expired date's long past due, but I'm still on the freaks,

I crack it open, smell's so putrid, it'll make your eyes water,
But I'm Slim Shady, ain't no expiration date gonna alter,
My thirst is fierce, ain't no science gon' stop me from drinkin',
Gulps it down, feels like acid burnin', got my stomach thinkin',

Yo, 'bout to spit some hot fire, don't you forget,
'Bout the time I drank that milk, and my stomach got wrecked,
Expired date, curdled up, smelled like rotten cheese,
But I was feelin' thirsty, ain't no drink gonna freeze,

I cracked it open, took a big ol' swig,
Felt it hit my tongue, it was like a toxic gig,
Bitter taste, funky aftertaste,
Shoulda known better, but I didn't hesitate,

(Chorus)
Spoiled milk in my belly, got me feelin' whack,
Stomach's churnin', got a serious fact,
Got my gut doin' flips, it's a sickening thrill,
Spoiled milk, yeah, it's a deadly fulfill,

(Verse 2)
Thought I was tough, thought I could take the pain,
But now I'm payin' for it, ain't no way to sustain,
Gut's on fire, feels like acid rain,
Regret is the word, as I'm writhin' in pain,

Vomit's on my breath, can't nobody stand near,
My stomach's growlin', it's a deadly fear,
Don't wanna be here, wanna disappear,
Spoiled milk's the culprit, it's crystal clear,

(Bridge)
Lesson learned, shoulda checked the date,
Now I'm sufferin' from this dairy hate,
If only I'd listened, if only I'd cared,
Wouldn't be singin' this spoiled milk blues, with a gut full of despair,

(Verse 3)
Time's passin' slow, hours tickin' by,
Feel like I'm dyin', why oh why did I try?
