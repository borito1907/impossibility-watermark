**""Sizzle and Sweat""**

(Verse 1)
I hit the kitchen floor, before the sun is high 
My whites are tied up tight, got my game face on to try 
To crank out dishes all day long 
 Orders flying left and right, it's a culinary throng 

(Chorus)
It's sizzle and sweat, fire and steam 
We're cooking up dreams, that's what we beam 
From line to plate, our craft's at stake 
Feeding hearts, not just plates 

(Verse 2)
Mise en place, prep work's done 
Got my station set, ready for fun 
Chopping boards at the ready 
Knives sharpened, skills steady 

(Chorus)
It's sizzle and sweat, fire and steam 
We're cooking up dreams, that's what we beam 
From line to plate, our craft's at stake 
Feeding hearts, not just plates 

(Bridge)
Ticket comes in, order's hot 
Panic starts, but I've got this shot 
Flipping pans, stirring pots 
Timing's key, flavors pop 

(Verse 3)
Expediting's a dance 
Calling shots, a second chance 
Plating's art, presentation too 
Garnish and finish, serve it new 

(Chorus)
It's sizzle and sweat, fire and steam 
We're cooking up dreams, that's what we beam 
From line to plate, our craft's at stake 
Feeding hearts, not just plates 

(Outro)
The night winds down, shift's done late 
Dishes clean, kitchen great 
Tomorrow's menu's on my mind 
Rest assured, I'll be back in line.

**""Heat of the Kitchen""**

(Verse 1)
I wake up every morning, before the sun is high

Head to the kitchen, where the day says goodbye

To the night before, and all its strife

I trade my apron for a knife, and a culinary life

**(Chorus)**
I'm feeling alive in the heat of the kitchen tonight

Where the flames rise high and the pots ignite

I'm just a cook, but this is my delight

In the chaos and noise, I feel like I take flight

**(Verse 2)**
The line is long, the orders fly

Tickets keep coming, I gotta think on my feet and try

To plate perfection, every single time

A pinch of salt, a dash of flair, make it sublime

**(Chorus)**
I'm feeling alive in the heat of the kitchen tonight

Where the flames rise high and the pots ignite

I'm just a cook, but this is my delight

In the chaos and noise, I feel like I take flight

**(Bridge)**
The diners may not know my name

But they taste my soul in every dish that's claimed

Their pleasure's my prize, their satisfaction too

That's what keeps me going, till the evening's through

**(Chorus)**
I'm feeling alive in the heat of the kitchen tonight

Where the flames rise high and the pots ignite

I'm just a cook, but this is my delight

In the chaos and noise, I feel like I take flight

**(Outro)**
As the last table leaves, the kitchen slows down

My shift comes to an end, in this whirlwind town

Tomorrow's another battle, but for now I rest

Feeling fulfilled, in the best.
