I'm stuck in my head, it's a never-endin' fight (fight)
My demons they whisper, day and night, ""you ain't right""
Got a voice that's louder than a gun, it's always ignitin'
Told myself I'd calm down, but the fire keeps on burnin'

My therapist says I need to face my past (past)
But the ghosts I've made won't let me rest at last (last)
They linger like a specter, hauntin' every room (room)
I try to shake 'em off, but they just rezoom

Welcome to the echo chamber of my mind (mind)
Where the voices scream and the noise is all the time (time)
It's hard to find solace when you're stuck inside (inside)
Your own worst enemy's the one that won't subside

**Verse 2:**
Pills and pills, the endless supply (supply)
Tryna drown the pain, but it just amplifies (amplifies)
Ain't no escape from this maze I'm trapped in (trapped)
Every door I open leads to more of the same skin (skin)

My mirror reflection stares back, so unkind (unkind)
Reminds me of all my shortcomings, my darkest crime (crime)
Self-doubt creeps in like a thief in the night (night)
Steals my confidence, leaves me feelin' like a fight

**Chorus:**
Welcome to the echo chamber of my mind (mind)
Where the voices scream and the noise is all the time (time)
It's hard to find solace when you're stuck inside (inside)
Your own worst enemy's the one that won't subside

**Verse 3:**
Critics say I'm washed up, it's time to fold (fold)
Industry's changed, my style's grown old (old)
But they don't know what drives me still (still)
Fuel for the fire that burns, a thousand miles to fulfill

Success ain't satisfied with just a taste (taste)
It's the addiction, the rush, the pace (pace)
Got to keep on grinding, got to stay awake (awake)
Prove myself once more, for my own sake

**Outro:**
The echoes start to fade away (away)
Quiet moments arrive, like an unexpected break (break)
For now, the storm subsides (subsides)
I breathe again, and realize...

112,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, searching for my place,
In this never-endin' maze, tryna find my escape,
Fuel for the anger, rage and pain,
 Tryna let go of the past, break free from the chains.

",True,3,"6,2",True,34
113,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, tryin' to find my way back home,
Where the rhymes flow free and my soul isn't overthrown,
In this dark alley of life, where the devils roam,
I'm searchin' for a light, a glimmer, a beacon to call my own.

",False,,,,35
114,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, can't find my way back,
I'm searchin' for the spark, to get me off the attack,
My inner voices loud, they're all on repeat,
Tries to drown 'em out, but the echoes still seep.

",True,1,"6,2",True,36
115,"[Chorus]
Lost in the haze, can't find my way back,
Got a bad case of writer's block, ain't no comin' back.
",True,1,"6,2",True,37
116,"[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for the light, but it's gettin' dark tonight,
Fadin' into shadows, losin' sight of the fight,
Can't escape the pain, gotta face the truth inside,
Tryna rise above, but this darkness is my guide.

",False,,,,38
117,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, it's a lonely ride,
Where's the light?",True,1,"6,2",True,39
118,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, tryna find my place,
Stuck between reality and a reckless pace,
Can't escape the darkness, can't erase,
The scars of my past, they still remain.

",True,3,"6,2",True,40
119,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, tryna find my way back home,
Through the darkness and pain, gotta leave my past alone,
Gotta break free from these chains that weigh me down,
Can't let the ghosts of '07 spin me around.

",True,3,"6,2",True,41
120,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, got my soul on a stake,
Adrenaline junkie, can't escape this dark ache,
Fuelled by addiction, fueled by the pain,
Riding through hell, tryin' to find my aim.

",True,1,"6,2",True,42
121,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, tryin' to escape,
Can't find my voice, trapped in this cage,
Tryna get free from these chains that bind,
Break loose, break out, leave the past behind.

",True,1,"6,2",True,43
122,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, ain't no gettin' away,
Drowning in the darkness, with each passing day,
Searchin' for a lifeline, some hope to break the pain,
Got me locked in this prison, can't escape the flames.

",True,3,"6,2",True,44
123,"[Chorus]
Lost in the haze, tryna find my way,
Through the noise, through the pain, every single day,
Fightin' my own war, my mind's on the attack,
Lost in the haze, where am I gonna land?

",True,1,"6,2",True,45
124,"[Chorus]
I'm tryin' to break free from the cycle of pain,
Tryna shake off the chains that still remain,
Cut the noise, quiet my brain,
Find my voice again.

",True,3,"6,2",True,46
125,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, tryin' to find my way,
Through the fog of fame, gotta break through each day,
Shadows creep in closer, taunting me to play,
Gotta shake 'em off, or they'll drive me insane.

",True,1,"6,2",True,47
126,"[Chorus]
Lost in the haze, can't escape,
My own private hell, no peace in shape,
Tears fall down, drown me whole,
Forever searching for my soul, like a mole.

",True,1,"6,2",True,48
127,"[Chorus]
I'm lost in the haze, drownin' in my own pride,
Can't shake the darkness, it follows me inside,
Where did I lose myself?",True,1,"6,2",True,49
128,"[Chorus]
Lost in the haze, can't find my way,
Back to the game, day by day,
Lost in the haze, voices in my head,
Sayin' ""Slim, get your act together"", instead of just bein' dead.
