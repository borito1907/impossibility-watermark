Here is a non-rhyming poem:

The sun sets slowly over the ocean's horizon 
A fiery ball of light sinking into the waves 
Leaving behind a trail of warmth and darkness 

As night descends the stars begin to twinkle 
Like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse of sky 
Their gentle sparkle illuminates the world below 

In this peaceful moment I find solace 
My worries and cares dissolving with each passing breath 
I am one with nature, connected to all that surrounds me 

May this tranquility remain long after the darkness fades 
And the light of dawn creeps back into my life.

Here's a non-rhyming poem:

Silence descends upon the city streets at dawn 
A stillness that seeps into every pore, calming the senses 
The world is bathed in soft, golden light as morning breaks 
Casting long shadows behind buildings, a stark contrast to the day's warmth 

In this quiet moment, worries and fears seem to fade 
Like mist evaporating under the sun's gentle rays 
The sounds of nature start to stir: birds take flight 
Their sweet melodies blending with the rustling of leaves in the breeze 

As the day awakens, so do we 
Our spirits renewed by the peace that lingers, a reminder to slow down 
And find solace in life's simple beauty, untouched by chaos.

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

Silence falls like a blanket over the city at night 
A stillness that wraps around the skyscrapers and streets 
The sounds of the day recede into memory as the stars appear 
One by one, like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse 

In this quiet hour, worries seem to fade 
The weight of responsibilities lifts, ever so slightly 
As if the darkness holds a gentle, soothing power 
That quiets the mind and calms the soul 

But even in the stillness, life stirs 
A subtle pulse beats through the concrete jungle 
A reminder that nothing remains frozen for long 
And even in rest, growth and change occur.

 Memories of summer days spent by the ocean 
 Warm sand beneath bare feet 
The sound of waves crashing against the shore 
Seagulls soaring overhead

Echoes of laughter carried on the breeze 

In those moments, everything feels right with the world 
Cares and worries washed away like footprints in the sand 
Leaving only peace and serenity behind 
Filling my soul with warmth and light.

Silence falls like a blanket over the landscape

A stillness that settles deep within my bones

The world is hushed, a quiet reverie

As morning light creeps slowly over the horizon

Golden hues seep into the sky, illuminating all in their path

The shadows retreat, exposing the gentle curves of the earth

Nature awakens from its slumber, stretching and unfolding

In this peaceful moment, I am filled with a sense of calm

The world's chaos and noise recede, replaced by the soothing sounds of dawn

A time for reflection, for contemplation, for being present

A new day unfolds, full of possibilities and promise.

Silence falls like a blanket over the city 
A stillness that seeps into every pore 
The world holds its breath as dawn breaks 
And darkness slowly recedes from view 

In this quiet moment, all seems possible 
As if the universe has paused to reflect 
On the beauty and chaos of life unfolding 
A tapestry of moments, each one unique and fleeting 

The stars still twinkle in the fading night sky 
A reminder of mysteries yet unknown 
Their light a whisper of what lies beyond 
A beckoning to explore, to seek, to discover 

In this brief reprieve from the day's madness 
We can find solace in the quiet hours 
A time for introspection, contemplation 
A chance to recalibrate our place in the world.

In this quiet moment, worries seem to fade away 
Leaving room for reflection and contemplation 
The world feels full of possibilities, yet empty enough to allow us to focus on our own paths 

 Memories linger at the edges of perception 
Fragile as moonlight, easily lost but deeply felt 
Our lives are complex tapestries, woven from threads of joy and sorrow, love and loss 

In this stillness, we can begin to unravel some of life's mysteries 
Discover hidden patterns and meanings beneath the surface 
And emerge with a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit.
