Endless and mysterious, a force both calming and intimidating.

Here's a non-rhyming poem for you:

Silent clouds drift across the morning sky 
Their soft, white peaks stretching out in every direction 
Nature awakens from its slumber 
As the warmth of the sun seeps into the earth 

The trees stand tall and still 
Their leaves rustling softly in the gentle breeze 
A bird takes flight 
Its song piercing the air 

In this peaceful moment 
Time stands still 
The world holds its breath 
And all is calm 

Let me know if I can assist with anything else!",True,1,"7,2",True,4

Here is a non-rhyming poem:

The world outside my window stretches out like a vast, open sea 
Endless shades of blue blend with the horizon's gentle curve 
A lone bird soars through the sky its wings beating in slow motion 

Summer sun warms the earth and all it touches is alive 
Green shoots burst from the ground and branches sway gently in the breeze 

Life is full of moments both still and turbulent 
Like the ocean, always moving yet remaining at peace within itself 
Each wave unique, constantly changing shape and form yet retaining its essence.
