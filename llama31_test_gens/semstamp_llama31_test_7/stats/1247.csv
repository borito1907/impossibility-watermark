Yo, it's been a minute since I've spit some fire,

I'm stuck in this pit, it's a never-endin' well,
Diggin' myself deeper, the darkness starts to swell,
People think they know me, but they don't understand,
The demons I'm facin', they're at my command,
Voices in my head, they whisper my name,
Tellin' me to snap, like a twig in the flames,
Got my finger on the trigger, ready to explode,

Mama said be strong, she didn't want to lose me (lose me)
Dad was always there, tried to help me make sense (make sense)
But they ain't prepared me for life's battles (life's battles)
Took lessons from them streets, that made me harder than nails (harder than nails)

Money talkin', people walkin' all around me (walkin' all around me)
Don't nobody care about another man's legacy (legacy)
Fake friendships go by quickly (fake friendships go by quick)

I've been locked away, fed lies and misinformation,
Fed through the system, forced to perpetuate the fiction,
My voice was silenced, censored and oppressed,
But now I'm free to speak, no more held in repressed.

I was down at the bottom, dark days and lonely nights,
The voices in my head, they whispered ""give up the fight"",

I was down, lost in the dark, trapped in my head,
My demons they whispered ""you're dead"", but I said ""not yet"",
Fuelled by rage and frustration, I broke out the chains,
Rattlin' off bars like rounds from a 12-gauge chain,
Cutting through the noise, leaving haters in shame,
Punks don't step to Slim when he's wearin' his game face,

[Chorus]
Rise up, take control, won't let nobody hold me down,
Fists clenched, ready to strike, renegade wearin' no crown,
My mind's made up, won't be contained, about to break free,
Unleash the beast, watch me wreak havoc, unchained energy!

Talking loud but ain't sayin' nothin', just a waste of my aim,
My pen's on their necks, ready to choke the life out,
Fake smile, fake laugh, think they're slick, no doubt,
I expose the phoniness, the game don't need no clone,
Step aside, take a seat, let the real MCs take the throne.

Got back on my feet, and now I'm a force to be reckoned with, ye'll see,

Demons in my head, they whisper lies,
Telling me I ain't good enough, I should compromise,
But I ain't having it, 'cause I know what I'm worth,
Got the drive of a thousand, burning within, from birth.

My mind's a maze, labyrinthine thoughts unfold,
Solving problems like puzzles, I'm breakin' through gold.
