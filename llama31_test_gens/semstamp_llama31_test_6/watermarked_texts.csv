""Hey! I wanted to give you an overview of the American Civil Rights Movement, which took place from the 1940s to the 1960s. The movement was led by African Americans who fought for their rights and freedoms, including equal access to education, employment, housing, and voting rights. Key figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, and Thurgood Marshall played crucial roles in advancing the cause.

One of the earliest milestones was the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. However, many Southern states continued to resist integration, leading to violent clashes between protesters and authorities.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56) marked another significant turning point. After Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person, thousands of African Americans boycotted the city's buses until they were desegregated.

In the 1960s, protests escalated with marches, sit-ins, and freedom rides. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (1963) drew hundreds of thousands to D.C. where MLK delivered his iconic 'I Have a Dream' speech.",2.8867513459481287,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,751.5508892536163
3841539628,"Brazil was ""discovered"" by the Portuguese in 1500, when a fleet led by Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. However, it's essential to note that indigenous peoples had inhabited the region for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.

Pedro Álvares Cabral is often credited as the European discoverer of Brazil. On April 22, 1500, he and his crew arrived at what is now known as Porto Seguro, in the state of Bahia, while on a voyage to India. Over the next few decades, the Portuguese established trade relationships with the local Tupi people and began to explore the coastline.

However, it's worth mentioning that there are also theories that other explorers might have reached Brazil before Cabral, such as:

1. The Vikings: Some historians believe that Leif Erikson, a Norse explorer, may have landed in present-day Brazil around 1000 AD.
2. Spanish explorers: There are accounts of Spanish expeditions reaching the Brazilian coast in the late 15th century, although these claims are not widely accepted by historians.

Regardless of who arrived first, the discovery of Brazil marked the beginning of European exploration and colonization of the continent.

While it's impossible to change history, I'll offer some alternative choices that could have potentially altered the course of the war:

1. **Hannibal's strategy: Focus on Rome, not Italy**: Instead of campaigning extensively across Italy, spreading his forces thin, Hannibal could have focused on marching directly towards Rome. This would have put pressure on the Roman government and forced them to divert resources from other theaters. By directly threatening Rome, Hannibal may have been able to dictate terms or even capture the city.
2. **Secure the sea lanes**: The Carthaginian navy was significant, but often underutilized. Control of the seas would have allowed Carthage to supply its armies more efficiently and prevent Rome's constant harassment of their shipping.

They may be unaware of their own limitations and lack of knowledge in a particular area, yet they remain confident in their abilities and continue to make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information.

World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, was one of the deadliest and most devastating conflicts in human history. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations, including all of the great powers, eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.

At its core, the war was sparked by the aggressive expansion policies of three countries: Germany, Italy, and Japan. The leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, had ambitions to expand his territory and impose a regime based on racial superiority over Europe. Similarly, fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini sought dominance in the Mediterranean, while Imperial Japan aimed to create an empire in East Asia.

Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, prompting declarations of war by France and Britain, setting off a chain reaction that drew more and more countries into the conflict. Over the next year, Germany expanded its territorial control across Western and Eastern Europe, culminating in the Battle of Britain, which marked a turning point as the British successfully defended their island against German air raids.

Meanwhile, Japan invaded China, and later attacked Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into the war. This surprise attack led President Franklin D.

When you sell, you're essentially ""riding the wave"" and benefiting from the upward momentum.

3535195189,"A very timely and important question! As a helpful assistant, I'll provide some suggestions on how to encourage people to support statehood for Puerto Rico:

1. **Educate them about the benefits**: Share information about the advantages of Puerto Rico becoming a state, such as:
	* Equal representation in Congress and presidential elections.
	* Increased federal funding for infrastructure, education, and healthcare.
	* Economic growth through increased access to federal programs and resources.
2. **Highlight the history and struggle for equality**: Explain the historical context of Puerto Rico's status as a US territory since 1898 and the ongoing struggles for equal rights and self-governance. This can help create an emotional connection and sense of justice.
3. **Emphasize the importance of American values**: Appeal to Americans' values of fairness, equality, and democracy by pointing out that:
	* Puerto Ricans are already US citizens (since 1917) but lack full representation and voting power.
	* Statehood would ensure equal treatment under the law and fulfill the promise of democracy.
4. **Share personal stories and experiences**: Introduce people to individuals from Puerto Rico who can share their personal stories and struggles, highlighting the human impact of the island's current status.

325363421,"Gaslighting is a form of emotional manipulation and psychological abuse where a person makes someone question their own sanity, memory, or perception. It's a deliberate attempt to distort reality, making the victim doubt themselves and their experiences.

The term ""gaslighting"" comes from a 1938 play called ""Gas Light,"" in which a husband tries to drive his wife insane by manipulating her perception of reality, including dimming the gas-powered lights and denying it when she notices.

Here are some common tactics used by gaslighters:

1. **Denial**: They deny previous agreements, conversations, or events.
2. **Blame-shifting**: They shift blame from themselves to the victim.
3. **Minimization**: They downplay the severity of their behavior.
4. **Emotional manipulation**: They use emotions to control the conversation, making the victim feel guilty, anxious, or uncertain.
5. **Projection**: They attribute their own negative behaviors to the victim.
6. **Lying**: They tell outright lies or withholding information to create confusion.

Gaslighting can be very damaging, leading to feelings of:

* Self-doubt and low self-esteem,
* Anxiety and stress,
* Confusion and uncertainty,
* Depression,
* Isolation,

1. **Administrative organization**: Spain is divided into autonomous communities (comunidades autónomas), provinces (provincias), and municipalities (municipios). Each municipality has its own unique name and is identified by a unique code. This system helps avoid duplicate names.
2. **Municipal naming conventions**: In Spain, municipalities often have distinctive names that reflect their history, geography, or cultural heritage. Names may be derived from local languages (e.g., Catalan, Basque, Galician), Arabic influences (from Moorish rule), or references to notable features like rivers, mountains, or saints.
3. **Royal Decree of 1916**: A royal decree issued in 1916 established rules for naming municipalities in Spain. It prohibited the use of identical names for different municipalities within the same province or region. Although the decree wasn't always strictly enforced, it contributed to minimizing duplicates.

However, upon closer inspection, one discovers a rich tapestry of philosophical themes that beg to be unraveled.

One of the most striking aspects of Bilbo's journey is his transformative encounter with the ""other."" Through his interactions with trolls, elves, dwarves, and dragons, Bilbo is forced to confront his own limited perspective and biases. This echoes the ancient Greek concept of the ""mirror stage,"" wherein an individual forms their identity through encounters with others (Jacques Lacan). Bilbo's transformation from a complacent, provincial hobbit to a worldly, self-aware individual serves as a powerful allegory for personal growth and the importance of empathetic understanding.

Furthermore, Tolkien's depiction of Bilbo's inner struggle between comfort and curiosity raises questions about the human condition. Is it more virtuous to prioritize security and familiarity, or should we embrace the unknown, risking uncertainty and potential discomfort? The tension between these opposing desires serves as a timeless reminder of the human propensity for both stability and exploration.

2. Since we're excluding Mexico (which is actually part of North America, not Central America), let's consider the remaining 7 countries in terms of area:
   - Belize has an area of approximately 22,966 square kilometers.
   - Costa Rica's area is about 51,100 square kilometers.

Some arguments for why some people consider Israel an apartheid state:

3. **Settlements and displacement**: Israel's construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank has led to the displacement of Palestinians from their lands, homes, and communities.

As an investor, it can be tempting to try to time the stock market. The idea of buying low and selling high sounds simple enough, but the reality is that attempting to predict market fluctuations is a futile endeavor that often ends in disappointment. In this article, we'll explore why trying to time the market is a losing strategy and what you can do instead.

**Market Volatility**

Stock markets are inherently volatile, with prices influenced by countless factors, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, company performance, and even sentiment. This unpredictability makes it impossible for anyone to consistently accurately forecast market movements. Even the most skilled analysts and experienced investors have difficulty predicting short-term market swings.

**Human Biases Get in the Way**

Our own biases and emotions also play a significant role in our investment decisions. We tend to make impulsive choices based on fear, greed, or recent experiences rather than objective data. When markets decline, we might sell out of fear, only to miss out on potential gains when they rebound. Conversely, when markets rise, we may buy in enthusiastically, only to lose money if there's a correction.

**The Dilemma:**
A woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what it cost him to produce. Even though this was more than anyone could pay, he refused to sell the drug at a lower price or give it away, saying he wanted to make as much money as possible. So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the store to steal the drug?

**Ethical Analysis:**

From a utilitarian perspective (consequentialism), one might argue that stealing the drug would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. Saving the life of Heinz's wife would bring happiness not only to her but also to her loved ones, including Heinz himself.

**Buddhism:**

In Buddhism, suffering (dukkha) is understood as an inherent part of life, arising from our unfulfilled desires, attachments, and ignorance about the nature of reality. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to attain liberation (nirvana) from this cycle of suffering through the Four Noble Truths:

1. **Acknowledging suffering**: Recognizing that suffering exists and is a natural part of life.
2. **Understanding the cause**: Identifying the root causes of suffering, namely craving (tanha), aversion (pratigha), and ignorance (avidya).
3. **Cessation of suffering**: Realizing that suffering can be overcome by eliminating its causes.
4. **Path to cessation**: Following the Eightfold Path (right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration) to end suffering.

Buddhist practices like meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection help individuals develop wisdom, ethics, and mental discipline to let go of attachment, cultivate compassion, and ultimately achieve liberation from the cycle of suffering and rebirth (samsara).",-0.8164965809277261,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1323.126968383789

In a discrete choice model, the dependent variable (also known as the response or outcome variable) is categorical and represents the chosen alternative from a set of available options. The independent variables (also known as predictor or explanatory variables) are the factors that influence an individual's decision-making process.

Here's a breakdown of key components:

1. **Choice Set**: A finite number of mutually exclusive alternatives (e.g., product brands, travel modes, treatment options).
2. **Decision-maker**: An individual or group making a choice.
3. **Attributes**: Characteristics or features associated with each alternative (e.g., price, quality, convenience).

**Types of Discrete Choice Models:**

The Ad Hominem fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. This fallacy can lead to wasted resources, misallocated funds, and misguided decisions in politics, business, law, healthcare, and many other fields.

Historically, Ad Hominem attacks have:

1. **Derailed crucial policy initiatives**: During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States invested heavily in social programs aimed at reducing poverty and income inequality. However, politicians and pundits attacked these initiatives by targeting the character of President Lyndon B. Johnson and his advisors rather than engaging with the substance of their policies. These personal attacks undermined support for the programs, leading to underfunding and eventual cancellation.
2. **Led to costly wars and conflicts**: The demonization of leaders like Saddam Hussein (Iraq), Muammar Gaddafi (Libya), and Hugo Chavez (Venezuela) led to military interventions, regime changes, and devastating consequences. These conflicts have resulted in trillions of dollars in costs, loss of life, and ongoing instability in these regions.

**What is JTBD?**

JTBD is a problem-solving and innovation framework developed by Clayton Christensen, a renowned Harvard Business School professor. The concept was first introduced in his book ""Competing Against Luck"" in 2016.

In essence, JTBD helps organizations understand why customers make the choices they do, and how to create products or services that meet their needs more effectively.

**The Core Idea:**

Traditional marketing focuses on customer characteristics, demographics, and preferences. However, this approach often falls short in understanding the underlying motivations and goals that drive consumer behavior.

JTBD takes a different tack by focusing on the specific tasks or ""jobs"" that customers are trying to accomplish in their lives. These ""jobs"" are not just functional tasks but also emotional and social ones.

**The Framework:**

To apply the JTBD framework, you need to identify the key elements:

1. **Jobs**: Identify the specific tasks or outcomes that your customers are trying to achieve. These jobs should be described in a way that is free from any preconceived notions about your product or service.
2. **Functional Jobs**: Focus on the practical, tangible tasks customers want to accomplish (e.g., ""I need to clean my house"").",2.0,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,990.9181053638458

* Do we have a moral duty to believe certain things?
* Are there moral constraints on what we should or shouldn't believe?
* Is it wrong to hold certain kinds of beliefs (e.g., unjustified, uninformed, or discriminatory)?
* Can we be held accountable for our beliefs?

For those who may not be familiar, here's a brief overview:

**History**: Catalonia is an autonomous community in northeastern Spain, with its own distinct culture, language (Catalan), and history dating back to the Middle Ages. In 1469, Catalonia merged with Aragon, which later formed part of the Kingdom of Spain. Over time, Catalonia has maintained a strong sense of identity and has had periods of relative autonomy.

**Modern-day tensions**: The current tension between Catalonia and Spain began to intensify around 2010, when Catalonia's regional government, led by Artur Mas, started to pursue greater autonomy from Spain. This movement gained momentum after the Spanish Constitutional Court struck down several provisions of the Catalan Statute of Autonomy, which aimed to increase self-governance for the region.

**2017 Independence Referendum**: On October 1, 2017, the Catalan government held a referendum on independence, despite opposition from the Spanish government, which declared it unconstitutional. The vote resulted in a majority in favor of independence (92% out of approximately 40% turnout). However, the process was widely seen as illegal, and Spain deployed police forces to try to stop the vote.",2.4494897427831783,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,635.1348528862
535087848,"Riba!

In Islamic finance, ""riba"" (also spelled as ""ribaah"" or ""ribbah"") refers to usury or interest charged on loans. It is considered haram (forbidden) in Islam.

In traditional Islamic law, there are two types of riba:

1. **Riba al-Nasi'ah** (riba of delay): This type of interest is charged when a borrower delays payment of the principal amount.
2. **Riba al-Fadl** (riba of excess): This type of interest is charged when the lender demands more money than the original loan amount.

The concept of riba is based on several Quranic verses and hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad). For example, the Quran says: ""O you who believe! Do not devour usury, doubling and quadrupling it..."" (Quran 3:130).

To comply with Shariah principles, many Muslims avoid investing in or using financial products that involve riba, such as conventional savings accounts or credit cards that charge interest. Instead, they opt for Islamic banking alternatives, like halal investment opportunities or Islamic financing models, which operate under a profit-sharing arrangement rather than interest-based lending.

2957583249,"The Sortino Ratio! It's a financial metric that helps investors and portfolio managers evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of an investment or a portfolio.

In simple terms, the Sortino Ratio measures the return on investment (ROI) in relation to the downside risk of an asset or portfolio. It's similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but with a key difference: it focuses only on the downside volatility, rather than both upside and downside movements.

Here's how it works:

**Sortino Ratio Formula:**

(SR) = (RP - RF) / (σd)

Where:

* SR = Sortino Ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted return)
* RP = Portfolio Return (the average return of the portfolio over a specific period)
* RF = Risk-Free Rate (the return from a ""risk-free"" investment, e.g., U.S. Treasury Bills)
* σd = Downside Standard Deviation (a measure of the standard deviation of losses below the mean or expected return)

By focusing solely on downside volatility, the Sortino Ratio provides a more nuanced view of an investment's risk profile.

Private cryptocurrencies, also known as ""privacy coins"" or ""anoncoins,"" aim to protect users' identities and transaction data by employing various cryptographic techniques. Some examples of popular private cryptocurrencies include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Verge (XVG). The main drivers behind the potential growth of private cryptocurrencies are:

2. **Growing need for secure transactions**: With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, there's an increasing demand for secure, confidential transactions.
3. **Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations**: By offering solutions for private transactions, these cryptocurrencies can help organizations comply with AML regulations while still allowing for some level of anonymity.

**Warning: Spoilers ahead**

In the context of the show, the HIP is a mystical-scientific initiative by an organization called NERV, aimed at achieving a hypothetical state of ultimate unity and peace for humanity. The idea behind this project is based on the concept of ""Instrumentality,"" which implies dissolving individual boundaries and fusing all human souls into a single, transcendent entity – essentially creating a collective being or ""super-being.""

Now, regarding its comparison with Catholic Christianity:

While not directly influenced by Christian theology, the HIP has several analogies with aspects of Catholicism, such as:

1. **Unification**: Just like HIP aims to merge all human consciousnesses into a single unit, Christianity's eschatology often emphasizes the union of believers in Christ, where they become members of his Body, with Christ as their Head (e.g., Colossians 3:15; Romans 12:4-5).
2. **Communalism vs. Individualism**: HIP seeks to dissolve individual identities, much like Catholic emphasis on community, communion (Latin: communio), and collectivity within the Church, which supersedes individual desires and interests.
3. **Escape from Suffering**: By merging with the Instrumentality, humanity would transcend pain, conflict, and suffering, similar to the Christian concept of eternal life, where believers are freed from sin, death, and misery, united with God in heaven.",0.2182178902359924,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1429.6153991222382

""Financializing Poverty: Labor and Risk in Indian Microfinance"" is a research area that explores the intersection of finance, poverty, labor, and risk in the context of microfinance in India.

Microfinance, which involves providing small loans to individuals or groups who lack access to traditional banking services, has been touted as a solution to poverty reduction. However, critics argue that it can also perpetuate debt traps and exacerbate existing inequalities.

In India, microfinance has grown significantly over the past few decades, with many institutions offering small loans to millions of borrowers, mostly women.

2. **Labor exploitation**: Microfinance institutions (MFIs) may promote labor-intensive activities, such as handicraft production or agricultural work, without ensuring fair wages or working conditions.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) was a prolific philosopher who wrote extensively on various topics, including metaphysics, epistemology, politics, and history. While opinions may vary, here's one of his most influential and enduring ideas:

**The Dialectical Process: Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis**

Hegel's magnum opus, ""Phenomenology of Spirit"" (1807), introduces the concept of the dialectical process, which is often seen as his most significant contribution to philosophy. In essence, the dialectic is a dynamic, three-stage process where an initial idea or state (Thesis) is confronted by its opposite (Antithesis), leading to a higher level of understanding or synthesis.

1. **Thesis**: An initial idea or proposition.
2. **Antithesis**: The negation or opposing force to the thesis.
3. **Synthesis**: A higher-level understanding or unity of opposites, preserving the positive aspects of both thesis and antithesis.

This dialectical process is not limited to abstract thinking; it reflects the dynamic, self-overcoming nature of reality itself. For example, in the context of history, this might mean that a social system (thesis) leads to its own contradictions (antithesis), ultimately giving rise to a new, more evolved system (synthesis).",2.4494897427831783,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,682.775710105896

1. **Establish an unregistered scheme**: Since contractors aren't technically employees, you won't be able to establish a traditional ESOP under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth). Instead, create an unregistered scheme, which doesn't require registration with ASIC.

Dialectical materialism is a philosophical framework that combines two key concepts: dialectics and materialism.

**Materialism**: In this context, materialism refers to the idea that reality consists of physical matter and energy, rather than spiritual or supernatural entities. This perspective asserts that everything can be explained through natural laws and scientific observation.

**Dialectics**: Dialectics is a way of understanding how things change, develop, and interact with each other. It's based on the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German philosopher who developed the concept of the ""unity of opposites."" In essence, dialectics recognizes that opposing forces or contradictions can drive change, growth, and evolution.

**Dialectical Materialism**: When you combine these two concepts, you get dialectical materialism. This philosophy posits that all phenomena, including social, historical, and natural events, can be understood as part of an ongoing process of dialectical interaction between opposing forces. These interactions lead to continuous change, contradiction, and eventual transformation.

Jess Phillips, a British Labour Party politician, has made public statements about International Men's Day in the past. While I don't have real-time access to current events, I can tell you that her previous comments have generated significant debate.

In general, Phillips' views on International Men's Day (IMD) focus on raising awareness about the specific issues affecting men and boys, such as mental health, prostate cancer, and male suicide rates. She has argued that these concerns often go unaddressed and deserve attention, just like women's issues on International Women's Day.

However, some critics have accused Phillips of using her platform to dismiss or undermine feminist causes by drawing comparisons between IMD and IWD. Others see her efforts as an attempt to promote men's rights at the expense of women's rights.

It's essential to acknowledge that perspectives on this topic tend to be highly polarized. Some people support Philips' stance, believing that both men's and women's issues should receive equal attention, while others view her comments as misguided or insensitive.

Napoleon's victory at Waterloo secures his position as the dominant power in Europe. The coalition of British, Prussian, and other forces is defeated, and their leaders are forced to negotiate a peace treaty on unfavorable terms.

The Treaty of Paris (revised) recognizes Napoleon's expanded empire, which now includes most of Western and Central Europe. France becomes the undisputed hegemon, with its influence stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to Poland, and from Italy to the Low Countries.

2. Establishes the Imperial Council: A council comprising representatives from the conquered territories, with limited powers, to advise Napoleon on matters concerning the empire.

The UK's dominant economic and colonial power, combined with its strong financial system, including the Bank of England as a central bank, made the pound a widely accepted and trusted currency for international trade and finance.

However, it's worth noting that before the British Pound, other currencies also played significant roles in global finance:

1. **Spanish Dollar** (16th-17th centuries): After the conquests of the New World, Spanish silver coins became widely used in international trade.
2. **Dutch Guilder** (17th century): The Netherlands' rise as a major trading nation saw the guilder become an important currency for international transactions.

In fact, most scholars agree that Jesus was likely born in the spring or fall, based on biblical descriptions and historical records. So, why do we celebrate his birthday on December 25th?

There are a few theories:

1. **Early Christian tradition**: One theory is that early Christians chose December 25th to co-opt existing pagan festivals celebrated around the same time, such as Saturnalia (December 17-23) and Sol Invictus (December 25). By adopting these dates, they could more easily convert pagans to Christianity.
2. **Roman festival influence**: Another theory suggests that the date was chosen to coincide with the Roman festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (Day of the Birth of the Unconquered Sun), which was celebrated on December 25th. This festival marked the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, after which the days begin to get longer again. Early Christians might have seen this as a fitting analogy for Jesus being the ""light"" that came into the world.

2453573281,"The 4% withdrawal rate rule, also known as the ""4% rule"" or ""Bengen Rule,"" is a widely accepted guideline in the financial industry that suggests that retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their retirement portfolio each year, adjusted for inflation, without depleting their assets over time.

This concept was first introduced by William Bengen, a certified public accountant and investment advisor, in his 1994 study titled ""Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data."" Bengen analyzed historical stock market data from 1926 to 1975 and found that a portfolio consisting of 60% stocks and 40% bonds could sustain an annual withdrawal rate of 4% for at least 30 years, even during times of high inflation or poor market performance.

Here's how it works:

1. The retiree determines the total value of their retirement portfolio.
2. They calculate 4% of the portfolio's value (based on its current balance).
3. This amount becomes the maximum annual withdrawal allowance.
4. Each subsequent year, the allowance increases by the same percentage as inflation, to maintain purchasing power.

For example, if a retiree has a $500,000 retirement portfolio, the initial 4% withdrawal would be:

$500,000 x 0.04 = $20,000 per year

In the second year, if inflation rises by 3%, the new withdrawal allowance would become:

$20,000 x 1.03 = $20,600

In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared that smallpox had been eradicated, making it the first human disease to be completely eliminated from the planet. This achievement was made possible by a global effort led by the WHO, in collaboration with governments, healthcare professionals, and international organizations.

Smallpox was a highly infectious and deadly disease that had ravaged humanity for over 3,000 years, killing an estimated 300-500 million people in the 20th century alone. The disease was responsible for an estimated 10-15% of all deaths worldwide, primarily affecting children under the age of five.

1471365560,"Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor and King of Prussia, was not exactly ""dear"" to Queen Victoria, but rather her complicated grandson.

Queen Victoria's eldest child was Victoria, Princess Royal, who married Frederick III, German Emperor. Their son, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was therefore Queen Victoria's grandson. In fact, he was one of nine grandchildren she had from her six children who married into European royal families, earning her the nickname ""the Grandmother of Europe"".

While Queen Victoria was close to some of her other grandchildren, such as those in the British royal family, her relationship with Kaiser Wilhelm II was strained at times due to their differing personalities and his increasing militarism and nationalism, which worried Queen Victoria.

In the years leading up to World War I, tensions rose between Germany and Britain, making relations between Queen Victoria (who died in 1901) and her grandson Wilhelm even more complicated. However, it is worth noting that the two were reportedly fond of each other during Wilhelm's childhood visits to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

It seems you may be referring to the often-stated quote about Kaiser Wilhelm II being Queen Victoria's ""dearest grandson"", however this appears to be an oversimplification or possibly apocryphal.",1.091089451179962,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,685.2531940937042

Macro played an important role in Roman history, particularly in the transition from Tiberius to Caligula's rule. Here's what I found:

* Macro rose through the ranks of the Praetorian Guard under Tiberius' command.
* In 31 AD, he became the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard, replacing Sejanus, who had been accused of treason against Tiberius.
* Macro worked closely with Emperor Tiberius, carrying out his will and enforcing his policies within Rome.
* When Tiberius died in 37 AD, Macro helped facilitate the transition of power to Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, also known as Caligula.
* After Caligula's accession, Macro continued as Praetorian Prefect but began to lose influence over the new emperor.
* Eventually, Caligula saw Macro as a threat due to his close association with Tiberius, and around 38 AD, Macro was dismissed and eventually forced into exile or even possibly murdered on orders from Caligula.

Born in 1776 on the island of Corfu, then part of the Venetian Republic, Kapodistrias studied law at Pisa University and later became a diplomat for Russia, serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1815 to 1822.

In 1827, he was invited by the provisional government of newly independent Greece to become the country's first head of state, or Governor. He accepted the position and served from April 1828 until his assassination in September 1831.

During his tenure, Kapodistrias implemented several reforms aimed at establishing a stable and modern Greek state. Some of his key achievements include:

* Establishing a centralized administration system, with departments and ministries.
* Creating a judicial system based on European models.
* Encouraging foreign investment and trade.
* Laying the groundwork for education and cultural development.

However, Kapodistrias faced strong opposition from various factions within Greece, particularly those who resented his efforts to centralize power and limit local autonomy.

**Pre-Colonial Era (Before 1914)**

In pre-colonial Nigeria, there were no modern-style political parties as we know them today. However, various ethnic groups and kingdoms had their own systems of governance and leadership structures.

* The Hausa-Fulani people of Northern Nigeria had a monarchical system with emirs and sultans holding power.
* The Igbo people of Eastern Nigeria had a decentralized system of government with councils of elders and age grades playing important roles.
* The Yoruba people of Western Nigeria had a monarchical system with obas and chiefs ruling over city-states.

These traditional systems of governance were later influenced by European colonialism and Christianity, which introduced new ideas about politics and governance.

**Colonial Era (1914-1960)**

During the colonial era, the British imposed their system of governance on Nigeria, including the establishment of political parties.

* In 1922, the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP) was formed by Herbert Macaulay, a Nigerian nationalist and politician. This party was the first modern-style political party in Nigeria.
* In 1944, the Nigerian People's Party (NPP) was founded by Obafemi Awolowo, who would later become a prominent leader in Nigerian politics.",-0.19245008972987526,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1530.9213008880615

His reign was marked by profound social change, military conquests, and domestic reforms that reshaped Europe.

One of Napoleon's early accomplishments as a young officer was his involvement in the Siege of Toulon (1793), where he successfully drove out British forces occupying the port city. This impressive display of tactical acumen caught the attention of his superiors, propelling him up the ranks (Markham, 1988, p. 15). However, it wasn't until the coup d'état in 1799 that Napoleon truly seized control of France, marking the beginning of the Napoleonic Empire.

Domestically, Napoleon implemented numerous reforms aimed at modernizing French society and economy.

Here's what happened:

In 1789, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed a tax on whiskey and other spirits to help pay off debt from the Revolutionary War.

Farmers and distillers in western Pennsylvania, who relied heavily on whiskey production, were particularly affected by the tax. Many saw it as an unfair burden and resented the fact that they had no representation in Congress.

Protest and resistance grew rapidly, with farmers and frontiersmen expressing their discontent through violent demonstrations, threats against tax collectors, and boycotts of goods. In July 1794, a group of around 500 armed men attacked the home of regional inspector John Neville, who was responsible for collecting taxes in the area.

In response, Augustine wrote The City of God to defend Christianity and provide a comprehensive vision of Christian theology, philosophy, and politics.

The first part of the book responds to pagan critics who argued that the fall of Rome was due to the rise of Christianity. Augustine counters this claim by showing that the Roman Empire's problems predated Christianity and that its moral corruption was already evident before the advent of the new faith. He attacks the myths and idols of ancient Rome, demonstrating that they were not divine but rather human creations. Additionally, he argues that the prosperity and greatness of the Roman Empire were not evidence of divine favor, as pagans claimed.

Here's the story:

**Early Beginnings:**
The founder of Kubota, Gonshiro Kubota (1865-1934), was the son of a blacksmith who grew up in a rural area of Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Gonshiro was fascinated by mechanics and began working on his own inventions at a young age. After completing his education, he worked as an apprentice at various metalworking companies, gaining experience in iron casting and machinery repair.

**Founding of Kubota Ironworks**
In 1890, Gonshiro founded Kubota Ironworks Co., Ltd. (now known as Kubota Corporation) with an initial capital investment of ¥50,000 (approximately $450 USD). The company initially produced water pipes and cast iron products, such as cooking stoves and farming tools.

**Shift towards Agriculture**
In the early 1900s, Kubota shifted its focus to developing innovative agricultural machinery, including rice threshers and power cultivators. This marked a significant turning point for the company, setting it on the path to becoming a leader in agricultural equipment manufacturing.",3.709704134011871,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,333.55991792678833

Life:

Ahmed Yasawi was born in the village of Sayram, near modern-day Shymkent, in what is now southern Kazakhstan. His real name was Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Yasawi. From an early age, he showed great interest in spirituality and poetry. As a young man, he traveled extensively throughout the region, meeting with various spiritual leaders and learning from them.

Contribution to Literature and Spirituality:

Ahmed Yasawi's writings had a profound impact on the development of Turkic literature. He wrote in Chagatay Turkish, which later became a key influence on Uzbek, Kazakh, and other regional languages. His works include:

1. **Divan-i Hikmet** (""Wisdom's Book""): A collection of poems that explore themes of love, wisdom, spirituality, and moral guidance.
2. **Turbah** (""Dust"") : A book of wisdom teachings that reflect his Sufi philosophy.

Theon was a teacher at the famous Library of Alexandria, where he wrote commentaries on various mathematical and scientific texts, including those of Euclid and Archimedes. His commentaries were not only explanations but also included corrections and extensions to the original works.

In addition to his work in mathematics and astronomy, Theon was also interested in engineering and mechanics. He wrote about automata, or self-moving machines, and created mechanical devices such as water clocks and an armillary sphere.

One interesting aspect of Theon's life is that his daughter, Hypatia of Alexandria, was also a renowned mathematician, philosopher, and astronomer. She succeeded him as head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, becoming one of the first female leaders of a philosophical institution.

4077898943,"Victor Klemperer (1881-1960) was a German Jew, a Romance language professor, and a philologist who lived through some of the most tumultuous periods in European history. His life is an incredible story of resilience, courage, and documentation.

Klemperer's early career as a professor at Dresden Technical University focused on Romance languages and literature. However, with the rise of Nazism in Germany during the 1930s, his situation rapidly deteriorated due to his Jewish heritage. He documented this period extensively in his diaries, which later became a valuable primary source for historians studying Nazi Germany.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Klemperer's life is his meticulous diary entries from 1933 to 1945. He wrote these under constant threat of detection by the Nazis, making them a testament to his bravery and resolve. The diaries detail daily life in the Third Reich, including the gradual worsening conditions for Jews, such as forced relocations, confiscation of property, and eventually, deportation.

These diaries were published posthumously in several volumes: ""I Will Bear Witness"" (1933–1941), ""To the Bitter End"" (1942–1945), and ""The Lesser Evil"" (1995).",3.2659863237109046,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,732.1649789810181
3147368785,"The Osage murders, also known as the ""Reign of Terror,"" were a series of brutal and mysterious killings that took place in Oklahoma in the 1920s. The victims were members of the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe that had become wealthy due to the discovery of oil on their land.

In the early 1900s, the Osage Reservation was found to be sitting atop a massive oil reserve, which made the Osage people incredibly rich. However, the US government had imposed rules that required Osage individuals to have a guardian appointed by the court to manage their finances. This meant that non-Native Americans could control the financial affairs of Osage citizens, making it easy for them to exploit and manipulate the system.

Between 1921 and 1925, a string of gruesome murders took place, targeting Osage individuals who owned headrights – or shares of the oil revenue – that made them wealthy. The victims were often poisoned, shot, or bombed, with some cases involving multiple methods. Many bodies were left unidentified or buried hastily, and others were never found.

Some of the most notable cases include:

* Anna Brown, an Osage woman whose body was found dead from poisoning.
* Lizzie Q. Kyle, another Osage woman whose death was initially ruled as tuberculosis but later discovered to be caused by poisoning.",2.8867513459481287,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,910.0313675403595

2. The Second Sino-Japanese War is not the correct answer in this case as it happened in 1937.

During World War II, Japan had established an alliance with Vichy France, but by mid-1940, Japan began pressuring France to grant it military access to northern Indochina, where Japanese troops would eventually establish bases for future operations against British forces in Burma (Myanmar).

2725076692,"In the context of process behavior charts (also known as control charts), ""1 sigma"" refers to a statistical concept that measures the variation or dispersion of a process.

Specifically, 1 sigma represents one standard deviation from the mean value of a normal distribution. In other words, if you were to plot a histogram of your process data, about 68% of the data points would fall within 1 sigma (or one standard deviation) of the mean.

On a process behavior chart, the area between -1 sigma and +1 sigma is often shaded or highlighted to represent the expected normal variation of the process. This region typically contains around 68% of all data points, assuming the process is stable and normally distributed.

Here's what it means:

* **Within 1 sigma**: About 68% of the data points will fall within this range, indicating typical, acceptable variation.
* **Beyond 1 sigma**: Approximately 16% of data points (8% on either side) will fall outside this range, indicating some degree of abnormality or special cause variation.

The idea behind using 1 sigma limits on a process behavior chart is to separate common cause variation (random fluctuations within the system) from special cause variation ( unusual events or errors). By setting control limits at 1 sigma, you can quickly identify when something unusual occurs and take corrective action.",4.898979485566357,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,98.041579246521

Yes, I am familiar with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulations, specifically the Mortgage and Home Finance: Conduct of Business sourcebook (MCOB).

Rule 13 of the MCOB refers to ""Pre-contract disclosure in relation to regulated mortgage contracts"".

In essence, this rule requires lenders to provide borrowers with a Key Facts Illustration (KFI) document before they enter into a regulated mortgage contract. The KFI must contain information about the mortgage, including:

* The amount borrowed and interest rate(s)
* The term of the mortgage and any conditions that affect it (e.g., redemption penalties)
* Repayment details (including how much will be repaid each month)
* Any charges and fees associated with the mortgage

There is no direct conversion formula between BC/BCE and BH because the two calendars start at different times and have different numbering systems. However, if you want to determine the equivalent date relative to the beginning of each era:

- The Hijri calendar starts in 622 CE.
- Assuming an approximate correlation: 
    - 628 BCE would be roughly equivalent to approximately 1250 years before the start of the Hijri calendar, but since there isn't a direct ""BH"" designation for pre-Hijri years in common usage, this would not translate into a meaningful BH date. Instead, it refers to a time more than a thousand years before the advent of Islam.
    
    - 551 BCE would similarly be many years prior to the start of the Islamic calendar, equating to a period long before Islam.

Caesar was born into a noble family, the Julian clan, which claimed descent from the goddess Venus. His early life was marked by politics and education, studying law, rhetoric, and Greek culture.

**Rise to Power (60-49 BCE):**
Caesar became a prominent figure in Rome through a combination of intelligence, strategic alliances, and sheer determination. He formed the First Triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, two other powerful Romans. After serving as consul, he went on to conquer much of Gaul (modern-day France and Belgium) between 58-51 BCE.

Born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk developed an interest in computing and programming at an early age. He taught himself computer programming and, at the age of 12, created his first software program – a space-themed video game called Blastar.

After completing high school, Musk moved to Canada to attend college and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. After graduating, he dropped out of Stanford Graduate School's economics program after just two days, choosing instead to pursue a career in technology and entrepreneurship.

IBM's involvement in the Holocaust is a well-documented historical fact that has been extensively researched and acknowledged by the company itself. Here's a brief summary:

During World War II, International Business Machines (IBM) had a significant presence in Europe, including Germany, where it operated under the name Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen GmbH). The company provided technology and services to various governments, including Nazi Germany, which used them for purposes such as census-taking, social engineering, and racial registration.

In 1933, after Hitler came to power, IBM's German subsidiary, Dehomag, began working closely with the Nazi regime to implement a comprehensive system of punch cards to collect data on the population, including information about individuals' ethnicity, occupation, and residence. This system allowed the Nazis to systematically identify, track, and segregate Jews and other minority groups deemed undesirable.

The punch cards used by Dehomag were custom-made for the Nazi regime, containing special fields for tracking Jewish ancestry, religion, and marital status. These cards enabled the Nazis to efficiently categorize people according to their ""racial"" background and apply this information to enforce anti-Semitic laws, confiscate property, and ultimately facilitate the mass persecution and extermination of six million Jews during the Holocaust.",3.709704134011871,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,409.01418471336365

**Abstract**

This study examines the impact of Federal Reserve monetary policy on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning from January 1990 to December 2022, we investigate the relationship between the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and WTI price movements. Our analysis reveals significant evidence that changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy have a substantial impact on WTI prices. Specifically, we find that expansionary monetary policies lead to increased WTI prices, while contractionary monetary policies result in decreased WTI prices. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between macroeconomic variables and commodity markets.

**Introduction**

Crude oil is one of the most widely traded commodities globally, with its price fluctuations having far-reaching implications for economies worldwide. As the primary regulator of the United States' financial system, the Federal Reserve plays a critical role in shaping the country's economic trajectory through its monetary policy decisions.

If 1 pound (GBP) is equal to 1.20 euros (EUR), then we can set up the following equation:

1 GBP = 1.20 EUR

To find out how many euros are equivalent to 672 pence (since there are 100 pence in 1 pound), we can first convert the pence to pounds and then convert that amount to euros.

There are 100 pence in 1 pound, so:

672 pence ÷ 100 = £6.72

Now, let's convert this amount to euros using the exchange rate we established earlier:

£6.72 x 1.20 EUR/GBP = €8.064

Early Life and Writing Career:
Havel was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, into a family of intellectuals and artists. He began writing plays at an early age and became known for his absurdist style, which often critiqued the bureaucratic and repressive nature of life under communism. His plays, such as ""The Garden Party"" (1963) and ""The Memorandum"" (1965), were widely acclaimed and performed throughout Europe.

Dissidence and Activism:
As a vocal critic of communism, Havel was blacklisted by the government and banned from publishing his work. He continued to write in secret, and his plays were smuggled out of the country to be performed abroad. In 1977, Havel co-founded the human rights group Charter 77, which advocated for individual freedoms and human rights in communist Czechoslovakia.

Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) deals with research and experimental expenditures, which can be expensed or capitalized by taxpayers.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), also known as the Tax Reform Act of 2017, introduced an amendment to Section 174, specifically Section 174(a).

Prior to TCJA, taxpayers could elect to deduct research and experimental expenditures under Section 174(a) in the year they were incurred. This allowed companies to expense these costs immediately, rather than capitalizing them over time.

However, the TCJA made significant changes to Section 174(a). Under the amended law, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, all specified research or experimental expenditures must be **capitalized** and amortized ratably over:

* A period of at least 5 years for expenditures attributable to research conducted within the United States.
* A period of at least 15 years for expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the United States.

1918636967,"A great question about a significant thinker!

Moishe Postone was an American sociologist and historian, best known for his work on critical theory and Marxist thought. He passed away in 2018, but his intellectual legacy lives on. Here's an overview:

**Time, Labor, and Social Domination**: Postone is perhaps most famous for his book ""Time, Labour and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation of Marx's Critical Theory"" (1993). In it, he offers a novel reading of Karl Marx's critique of capitalism, focusing on the role of time as a fundamental dimension of modern society.

**Rethinking Critical Theory**: Postone challenged traditional understandings of critical theory by arguing that Marx's thought should be seen as a critique not just of capitalism, but also of the labor movement and the notion of socialism. He claimed that both capitalist societies and those that consider themselves socialist can perpetuate alienating social forms.

**Commodity fetishism and the fetishization of technology**: Postone extended Marx's concept of commodity fetishism to argue that modern society fetishizes technology, treating it as an autonomous force driving historical development rather than recognizing its social origins. This analysis has been influential in understanding the rise of technocratic ideologies.

**Dialectics of abstract and concrete labor**: Postone developed a distinctive interpretation of Marx's concepts of abstract and concrete labor.",2.8867513459481287,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,914.839962720871

Here's a brief overview of his life and achievements:

**Early Life**
Sun Yat-sen was born in Guangdong Province, China, to a family of farmers. He studied medicine at the University of Hong Kong, where he became interested in Western politics and philosophy.

**Revolutionary Activities**
In 1894, Sun joined the Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society), a secret society dedicated to overthrowing the Qing dynasty. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent leader in the organization. In 1911, he founded the Tongmenghui (Chinese Revolutionary Alliance), which merged with other groups to form the Kuomintang (KMT) party.

**Overthrow of the Qing Dynasty**
On October 10, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising marked the beginning of the Xinhai Revolution, led by Sun Yat-sen. The revolution ultimately led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912.",0.8164965809277261,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,1181.72407913208

However, after verifying, I found that there is another emperor named Zhu Yujian (not Yijun) who was an emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty.

Zhu Yujian (also known as Longwu Emperor), was the first emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty in China. He ruled from 1646 until his death in 1647. Born on August 30, 1602, he was the son of Zhu Changying, Prince Danyang and the grandson of Wanli Emperor, making him a member of the Zhu imperial family.

After the fall of Beijing to the Qing forces in 1644, the remnants of the Ming court retreated southward. In 1645, Zhu Yujian proclaimed himself the new ruler of the Ming dynasty with the name Longwu Emperor, establishing his capital at Fuzhou.

Unfortunately, his reign was short-lived, and he died on October 6, 1647, during the capture of Tingzhou by Qing forces. 

It's possible that there might be some confusion about Zhu Yijun being another name for the Hongguang Emperor or another relative of the Ming dynasty emperors.",1.6329931618554523,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,864.7269902229309
3321322551,"June 4, 1989, was a significant day in world history. On that day:

* The Tiananmen Square protests came to an end with the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations by Chinese authorities. The event resulted in a reported death toll ranging from hundreds to thousands.
* U.S. President George H.W. Bush signed Executive Order 12665, banning the sale of military equipment and technology to China due to human rights concerns.

However, I think most people might associate June 3-4, 1989, with the Tiananmen Square Massacre or simply ""6/4"" (using Chinese date notation). This is because, on the night of June 3 and early morning hours of June 4, 1989, the Chinese government deployed troops and tanks to quell the student-led protests calling for democratic reforms.

""Banja Luka"" is derived from the Bosnian language, where ""banja"" means ""spa"" or ""bath"", and ""luka"" means ""meadow"" or ""valley"". The city was named after a spa located near a meadow, which was a popular spot for locals to relax and unwind.

In history, the area around Banja Luka had been settled since ancient times, with archaeological findings dating back to the Roman era.

The book is part memoir, part philosophical exploration, and it recounts Frankl's experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War II.

The book has two parts. The first part is a narrative of Frankl's experiences in the camps, where he describes the unimaginable atrocities and suffering that he and millions of others endured. Despite being a Jewish doctor, Frankl was deported to Auschwitz and later transferred to other camps, including Kaufering and Türkheim.

However, it's not just a horror story. Frankl's writing is remarkable because, even in the midst of unimaginable suffering, he observed and reflected on the psychological and spiritual dynamics at play among prisoners. He noticed that those who had a strong sense of meaning and purpose were more likely to survive and find ways to resist the dehumanizing conditions.

In the second part of the book, Frankl develops his theory of logotherapy, which emphasizes the search for meaning as the primary driving force behind human behavior. He argues that even in the most challenging circumstances, individuals can find meaning through three main avenues:

In Belgium, income taxes are progressive and depend on several factors such as marital status, number of children, and type of income (labour income or other). To give you an estimate of the tax revenue for a Belgian employee with a revenue of €120,000 in 2022, I'll make some assumptions:

* Single person, no children (no dependent family members)
* Labour income only (salaries, wages, benefits in kind)
* No other sources of income (e.g., self-employment, capital gains)

Based on the Belgian income tax rates for 2022, here's a breakdown of the estimated tax calculations:

**Gross salary:** €120,000 per year

**Tax-deductible expenses:**

* Mandatory social security contributions (approximate): 13.07% (11.27% pension + 1.8% healthcare) = €15,684 ( rounded to the nearest euro)

| Up to €13,440 | 25% |
| €13,441 - €38,660 | 40% |
| €38,661 - €86,200 | 45% |
| Above €86,200 | 50% |

Calculating the taxes using the above tax brackets:

Taxable income up to €13,440: €3,360 (25% x €13,440)
Taxable income between €13,441 and €38,660: €10,206 (40% x €25,220)
Taxable income between €38,661 and €86,200: €21,489 (45% x €47,539)
Taxable income above €86,200: €18,000 (50% x €36,000 is not applicable as this exceeds our remaining amount, we use the marginal rate on the remainder) 
Remaining: €18,116 * 0.5= 9,058 (50%)

Adding these amounts together gives us approximately €42,113.",0.8164965809277261,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,318.3668649196625
2916524798,"William Sebold, also known as ""Tramp"" to his German handlers, was an American double agent who played a crucial role in uncovering a network of Nazi spies operating in the United States during World War II.

Born on March 7, 1899, in Berlin, Germany (then the capital of the German Empire), Sebold immigrated to the United States in 1921 and became a naturalized citizen in 1938. However, he still maintained strong ties to his German heritage and even kept his birth name, Wilhelm ""Willi"" Sibert.

Sebold's involvement with the German intelligence service, Abwehr, began in 1940 when he returned to Germany to visit relatives. He was approached by the Abwehr, who tried to recruit him as a spy, exploiting his knowledge of the U.S. industrial landscape. Sebold accepted their offer but immediately reported this encounter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

What followed is quite remarkable! The FBI decided to use Sebold as a double agent, providing false information to the Germans while passing them accurate intel about minor matters that wouldn't harm national security. This deception campaign was so convincing that the Nazis trusted Sebold completely.

During the next three years, Sebold communicated extensively with his German handlers through radio transmission from New York City, sending some 2,000 coded messages containing fabricated information about the United States' war efforts.",4.426352063787131,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,365.08405327796936
804288048,"This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle!

The answer is: The North Pole.

When you travel 1 km south from the North Pole, you will be at a point on the Earth's surface that is 1 km away from the pole.
Then, when you travel 1 km west, you will still be at the same latitude (the distance from the equator), but you'll have moved around the Earth in a circular path (since all points at this latitude are on a circle).
Finally, when you travel 1 km north, you will return to your starting point at the North Pole.

So, you end up right back where you started!

The answer is also: Anywhere on the line of longitude which passes through a single geographical feature, specifically - anywhere on the prime meridian. However it is most commonly associated with the north pole due to its singular, definitive nature.  Another example would be near the South Pole where moving east/west means going round a smaller semi-circular route rather than actually increasing or decreasing longitude.",5.246313898711125,semstamp_lsh,hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4,510.2555682659149
