In a process behavior chart (PBC), 1-sigma (σ) refers to the control limits that are set at one standard deviation away from the process mean.

In the context of process behavior charts (also known as control charts), ""1 sigma"" refers to a statistical concept that measures the variation or dispersion of a process.

",True,2,"5,2",True,2
3,"Specifically, 1 sigma represents one standard deviation from the mean value of a normal distribution.",True,2,"5,2",True,1
4," In other words, it's a measure of how spread out the data points are from the average value.

",True,3,"5,2",True,1
5," In a process behavior chart, the mean is often represented by a center line.

",True,1,"5,2",True,2
6," In other words, it is the distance between the mean and the point at which about 68% of the data points fall within.

",True,3,"5,2",True,3
7," In other words, if you were to plot a histogram of your process data, about 68% of the data points would fall within 1 sigma (or one standard deviation) of the mean.

",True,2,"5,2",True,4
8,"On a process behavior chart, the area between -1 sigma and +1 sigma is often shaded or highlighted to represent the expected normal variation of the process.",True,2,"5,2",True,1
9," This region is also sometimes referred to as the ""common cause variation"" zone.

",True,7,"5,2",True,1
10," This region is also sometimes referred to as the ""common cause variation"" zone.

",True,7,"5,2",True,2
11," This region is also sometimes called the ""normal operating range.""

",False,,,,3
12," This range is sometimes called the ""inner limits"" or "" inner control limits"" of the chart.

",True,1,"5,2",True,4
13," Data points that fall outside this range (i.e., beyond ±1 sigma) may indicate special causes of variation, which can be worth investigating to identify opportunities for process improvement.

",True,1,"5,2",True,5
14," This region typically contains around 68% of all data points, assuming the process is stable and normally distributed.

",True,2,"5,2",True,6
15,"Here's what it means:

* **Within 1 sigma**: About 68% of the data points will fall within this range, indicating typical, acceptable variation.
",True,2,"5,2",True,1
16,"* **Beyond 1 sigma**: Data points outside this range may indicate special causes of variation, which could be worth investigating.

",False,,,,1
17,"* **Beyond 1 sigma** (i.e., outside the -1 sigma and +1 sigma limits): These values are more unusual and may indicate special causes of variation, such as errors, changes in raw materials, or equipment malfunctions.

",True,0,"5,2",True,2
18,"* **Beyond 1 sigma** (either above or below): Around 16% of the data points will fall outside this range on each side (i.e., 32% total).",False,,,,3
19,"* **Beyond 1 sigma**: Less than 32% of the data points will lie outside this range, suggesting unusual or special-cause variation.

",True,3,"5,2",True,4
20,"* **Beyond 1 sigma**: Data points outside this range may indicate special causes of variation, such as anomalies or unusual events.

",True,3,"5,2",True,5
21,"* **Between 1-2 sigma**: Approximately 27% of the data points will lie outside of 1 sigma but within 2 sigma, which may indicate some minor deviations or special causes.
",True,3,"5,2",True,6
22,"* **Beyond 1 sigma**: Data points falling outside this range may indicate special cause variation or unusual patterns that warrant investigation.

",True,3,"5,2",True,7
23,"* **Beyond 1 sigma** (i.e., above +1 sigma or below -1 sigma): The remaining 32% of the data points may indicate unusual or special cause variation, which might require investigation or corrective action.

",True,3,"5,2",True,8
24,"* **Between 1-2 sigma**: About 27% of the data points may fall outside this range but still be considered acceptable (95% of total data).
",True,1,"5,2",True,9
25,"* **Beyond 1 sigma**: Approximately 16% of data points (8% on either side) will fall outside this range, indicating some degree of abnormality or special cause variation.

",True,2,"5,2",True,10
26,"When interpreting your process behavior chart, if most data points fall within the 1-sigma range, it suggests that the process is stable and under control.",False,,,,1
27,The idea behind using 1 sigma limits on a process behavior chart is to separate common cause variation (random fluctuations within the system) from special cause variation ( unusual events or errors).,True,2,"5,2",True,2
28," By setting control limits at 1 sigma, you can quickly identify when something unusual occurs and take corrective action.
