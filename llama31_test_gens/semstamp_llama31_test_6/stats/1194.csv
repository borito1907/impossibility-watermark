",True,4,"5,2",True,2
103," To give you an estimate of the tax revenue for a Belgian employee with a revenue of €120,000 in 2022, I'll make some assumptions:

* Single person, no children (no dependent family members)
* Labour income only (salaries, wages, benefits in kind)
* No other sources of income (e.g., self-employment, capital gains)

Based on the Belgian income tax rates for 2022, here's a breakdown of the estimated tax calculations:

**Gross salary:** €120,000 per year

**Tax-deductible expenses:**

* Mandatory social security contributions (approximate): 13.07% (11.27% pension + 1.8% healthcare) = €15,684 ( rounded to the nearest euro)

Total taxable income: €104,316 (€120,000 - €15,684)

**Income tax rates (federal, regional, and municipal)**

Assuming the tax payer lives in the Flanders region (where the majority of the population resides), the applicable tax rate will be based on the following tax brackets:

| Taxable income | Marginal tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to €13,440 | 25% |
| €13,441 - €38,660 | 40% |
| €38,661 - €86,200 | 45% |
| Above €86,200 | 50% |

Calculating the taxes using the above tax brackets:

Taxable income up to €13,440: €3,360 (25% x €13,440)
Taxable income between €13,441 and €38,660: €10,206 (40% x €25,220)
Taxable income between €38,661 and €86,200: €21,489 (45% x €47,539)
Taxable income above €86,200: €18,000 (50% x €36,000 is not applicable as this exceeds our remaining amount, we use the marginal rate on the remainder) 
Remaining: €18,116 * 0.5= 9,058 (50%)

Adding these amounts together gives us approximately €42,113.
