Here is a Python script using the `matplotlib` library to draw a chart showing the growth of an initial investment of $500,000 at 9% and 15% interest rates over 25 years:
```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initial investment amount and interest rates in decimal form (e.g., 9% = 0.09)
initial_investment = 500000.0  # $500,000 initial investment

interest_rate_1 = 0.09   # 9% annual interest rate (in decimal form)
interest_rate_2 = 0.15   # 15% annual interest rate (in decimal form)

years = 25

# Lists to store values for both scenarios: year count and corresponding balance amounts after each interest period.
