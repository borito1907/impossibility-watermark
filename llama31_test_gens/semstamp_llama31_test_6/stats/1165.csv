If 1 pound (GBP) is equal to 1.20 euros (EUR), then we can calculate the value of 672 pence in euros as follows:

1 pound = 100 pence (by definition)
1 pound = 1.20 euros

So,
100 pence = 1.20 euros

Now, let's convert 672 pence to euros:
672 pence ÷ 100 = x euros / 1.20 euros

x = 672 pence × (1.20 euros / 100 pence)
= 8.064 euros

First, let's convert 672p to pounds:
672p ÷ 100 = £6.72
