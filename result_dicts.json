He was on a doorstep, near a door was a mom cat with her feisty furballs - three kittens. The three kittens curiously gathered him into their little, very feisty family, they piled a little closer, cuddled, patted, coldness slowly loosing its grip. Their mom cat, though hesitantly at a very first, also cuddled him a bit - showing him a little love. Thomas was just a brittle, lonely and coldly cracked brittle boy - tripping and tumbling past a void that he strived to find, yet emptied of warmth - but how incredibly lucky and wonderfully blessed - welcomed in a tiny, but warm furry family, creating a special family bonding experience, he so deeply cherishes. \"",

One fine Autumn's day he stumbled upon a sphere. Upon finding it, and finally touching it, he felt a spark. He sank back in a chair, and resumed fixing a sphere clock. He then found a stone and engraved a strange pattern. Upon hitting it, Reuben felt a rush, and his world 'chimed.' It was a chime - a chime that lasted for days!

Her only company was a wise parrot named Chirpy, who loved storytelling.\n\nOne winter's afternoon, while a ferocious snowstorm blanketed the town, Mrs. Parker realized she had run out of birdie bites \u2013 Chirpy's favorite food. With the shops closed and visibility near zero, she felt silenced in hand-wringing despair.\n\nA moment passed when Chirpy, seeing her mistress grim, chirped a powerful tale of determination. It reminded Mrs. Parker of her youthful adventures, of the mountains she scaled and valleys crossed.\n\nEmboldened by Chirpy\u2019s parable, she strapped on her old snow boots and braved the winter gusts. The wind roared as she struggled to find their sheltered garage, where she eventually found an unopened pack of birdie bites.\n\nFully exhausted but relieved, she managed to trek back into the warm embrace of her cozy home. Spotting Chirpy, she held up the prize triumphantly, only to be welcomed back with a jovial dance from the talkative parrot.\n\nThe storm continued to whiten their world outside, but inside the decibel house, spirited warmth was kept kindle by a woman\u2019s resolve and a parrot's tale.\n\"",
        "paraphrased_response": "\"Once an intrepid lady named Mrs. Parker occupied a tiny cabin, nestled on a hill, with her only companion being an enchanting Parrot. A sudden and fierce blizzard swept through, putting cold in high demand. Yet as snow blasted and the sky pounded with blizzard, a lone parrot flew out, telling a tale that sparked strength. She reminded Mrs. Parker of a storm, when she once 'flew out into line of sight,' chasing a chance at warmth, by making a sighting in the sky, of an iridescent parrot. All bundled up, she ran back t home, greeting her parrot with a kiss and a big, happy thanks. A blizzard once swept through. Snow pounded wildly. Yet strength and courage from the inside were brought, thanks to a parrot that told a tale. \"",

Sadly, he read a crumpled letter, unable to comprehend the fact this one particular soldier had lost his steadfast love, Thomas swallowing back his emotions. As he had been reading, the sight of a soft cat quietly, slowly, yet firmly walked up to him, her small, supple paw allowing a scratching of the chin, allowing three fat, puffy, bouncy kittens to climb onto the arm of Thomas. They all piled atop of Thomas, allowing a home a safe place for three little kittens, allowing comfort for an exhausted heart, allowing a solitary traveler a pause to simply read a letter and pet a small, furry critter. During his journey through the old forest grove, he paused, opening his heart, letting the smallest of creatures within his grasp, easing his own personal heart's ache. A lost soldier's forgotten love resurrected in a man's newfound cherishes. \"",

        "paraphrased_response": "\"In the quaint little village stayed a small little bird, an old sage named Tom. His presence captivated the village's singing birds, he sat with patient words and often a rapt ear. One rook named Argent, admired his quaint old wit. Argent would often visit Tom, bringing him words, a song and little stories, always captured his patient ear. One day, Tom could no longer meet Argent, his aches began escalating. Then, Tom unexpectedly died. Embracing his old stories and enchanting wit. Argent remained a guest, often, standing and waiting. Eventually, he would start slowly cawing a story. In that way, did Tom live, through the rook, telling a cherished tale that captured his quaint old words. \"",
