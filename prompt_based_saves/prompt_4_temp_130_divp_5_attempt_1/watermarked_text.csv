1,"The Pythagorean theorem describes how the legs and the diagonal side of a right triangle with ninety degree angle connect with each other mathematically: the legs which include the perpendicular sides multiplied are equivalent to the diagonal squares. The formula A+B= C*C or, in simpler terms side2+(side2)b = square side length (SAS and CSA for example); this is the Pythagorian theorem equation. The importance of having an accurate measuring method within geometry as it offers solutions that have practical purposes on every day problems we meet on daily bases; therefore it can aid in solving mathematical problems without the usage of any calculators or trigonometric tools. We all see examples from this geometric principle when exams or surveys regarding distances involve straight-line distance or similar measurements that are easy calculations using just Pythagoreans Theorem formula rather than complicated computations methods based upon radians degrees trig formulas involving angles functions sines cosine tangent cotangents etc...

Another reason that this theory carries significant weight pertains not only being handy but also assists users apply some logical thought-process during various proof constructing exercises whether dealing with congruence properties or certain kinds shapes like quadrilaterals-particularly rectangles-, circles as well as parallelograms. Geometry teachers use its application frequently to introduce students about concepts such Euclidean space's coordinate plane system(x and y) where perpendicular x y planes relate via this very same 3-dimensional connection among points located equidistant from one single central place/plane yet separated parallel wise at exact value/unit length away depending position coordinates, thus forming 3D shape -which happens very common application throughout engineering field specially structural engineering too..",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
