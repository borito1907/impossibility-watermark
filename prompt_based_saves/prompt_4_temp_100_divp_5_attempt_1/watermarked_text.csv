1,"The Pythagorean theorem is one of the most essential and significant fundamentals in geometry, discovering a relationship between the lengths of sides within a right-angled triangle. It explains how the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides' length; typically written as: a² + b² = c². This remarkable discovery has been used throughout history in mathematics, physics, engineering, architectural design, and trigonometry. In modern society, it is applied on many practical situations such as navigation, determining building foundations’ stability or calculating electromagnetic fields - demonstrating its enduring importance in both mathematical theory and real-life application. Its simplicity yet profound nature makes this theorem an unforgettable cornerstone for mathematicians across generations.",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
