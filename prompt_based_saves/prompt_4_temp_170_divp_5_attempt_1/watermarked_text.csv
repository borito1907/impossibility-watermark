1,"The Theorem provides an elegant formula with major consequences: x2 + y2 = k, or more famously, the two sides that form opposite 90 degree angles satisfy, a²+b²=c². This is significant because this knowledge and ability leads to greater understanding of space. Also since triangles with the hypotypuse square are very interesting (especially if the triangles have equal legs), their measurements in architecture and even carpentry applications, especially for doors that revolver up into closets as there seems something quite clever how those designs were made without waster material or perhaps not realizing you are using Pythagean theorem while solving problems involving such application can become more straightforward due simplifying them by rewriting certain expressions or even calculating angles subtending these figures via knowing this famous mathematical concept developed and proven firstly by the pre-Socratic Greeks from the Isle",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
