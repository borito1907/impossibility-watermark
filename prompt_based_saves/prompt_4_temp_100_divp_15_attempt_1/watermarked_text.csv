1,"The Pythagorean Theorem is a significant and foundational concept in the field of geometry, which has an enormous application throughout various mathematical disciplines, engineering, architecture as well as computer science. The theorem simply describes how individual sides' square on a triangle is equivalent to another side resulting from two squares added along with the right angle hypotenuse. It's crucial because any given triangle's properties could be calculated and assessed based upon it, hence permitting the development and creation of new geometric theories or formulas for a variety of different practical applications. This essential property enables architectural structures that rely on specific measurements, and engineering principles employing mathematical algorithms in fields like aerodynamics or quantum physics, therefore being critical in making the progress we see now",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
