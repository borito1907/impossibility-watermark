1,"One example should appear in the paragraph illustrating the application of theorem to calculate distance on a plane.
Pythagorean Theorem is widely known as an essential concept in geometry and it holds great importance in many mathematical theories. The theorem states that in any right-angled triangle, the square of length of hypotenuse i.e side opposite to angle 90 degrees is equivalent to the summation of squares made by lengths of other sides. An example would make the understanding more clear. For instance, if we take two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on Cartesian Plane with x1 not equal to x2. Then, the Euclidean distance from point one to point two can be found with Pythagoras theorem as: distance=(âˆš((x2 - x1)^2+(y2 - y1)^2). Hence, this concept is very helpful while finding or calculating distance in geometry and helps mathematician in proving complex equations involving shapes containing at least one right angle.",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
