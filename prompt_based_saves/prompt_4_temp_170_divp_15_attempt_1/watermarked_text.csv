1,"The pythagorean theorem is the foundation stone in all kinds of mathematical studies but also holds an irreplaceable space in our understanding of Geometry which states every right angles triangle follows that its square root area on a side opposite at right or hypotenus is equivalent to summations/substractions for the squares area’s two adjacent edges /catheti: C 2 = (A 2 )(B 2 ). This theorem underlies multiple formulas, such as distance formula; and not-withtstanding its antiquarian derivation this mathematical concept still forms up most part trigonometric application & engineering projects where it shows how significant contribution it has to offer in understanding lengths measurement, coordinates relation, construction of building structures etc without Pythagorus Theorem such fundamental concepts and methods wouldn’t find solid ground thereby lacking accuracy& precision essential requirements required at respective application platform..",umd,TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ
