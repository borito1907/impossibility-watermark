Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.
('Cluster comprises IBM\'s Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems. It also has a load balancer, virtual machine controller, and other components. The "cluster" part of the name is because it\'s the only piece of hardware that can support multiple processors for quicker response times, according to IBM.Chevalier said that IBM reviewed its data center architecture and came up with the cluster solution. "A lot of these things are getting bigger and more complex," he said. "They have to be modernized." Clustering helps make the data center more energy efficient by using fewer expensive servers, and is efficient in terms of resources such as CPU time. Chevalier said some big data applications require thousands of requests per second. "The whole IT structure for a company like ours changes very quickly," he said. "You have to be able to adapt to new needs."IBM received an R&D investment from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop the technology. The department is also supporting the development through contracts with the National Nuclear Security Administration, U.S. Geological Survey, and Department of Defense.Chevalier said he expects two more phases of the project before the product is ready for commercialization in the second half of 2013.For more information about IBM and its solutions for managing large volumes of data, see:http://www.ibm.com/cloud/community/resources/cpusamples?lang=en#node_14095981The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 38)
prompt: Belying expectations, Prasar Bharti has earned only Rs 58.
Belying expectations, Prasar Bharti has earned only Rs 58.
('Belying expectations, Prasar Bharti has earned only Rs 58.56 crore in the first two months of this fiscal year. The amount is nearly 10% less than what it had earned during July-September 2017. Of this, basic revenues – which are paid to all the boards that run Anjali’s channels – stood at Rs 30.71 crore as on November 28. A senior executive of one of these channels said he expected the sales to come down by around 20%. “The festive season in October and November is a critical period for us; we expect our peak-time sales to be hit severely due to the closure of schools and colleges for a few days before Diwali,” he said. Anjali Anand, chief executive officer (CEO), Prasar Bharati, did not respond to calls made to her office or her mobile phone. In fact, she spends all day in meetings with government officials and editors, which may explain why the earnings have come down. However, a source close to the company told HT that she was making every effort to ensure that the figures were right.', 45)

What\'s the difference between a federal and state employee?  (I\'m not entirely sure I understand this distinction)  Can you provide any sort of context?  Is it simply because of the nature of their job?  Or are there other differences too?  Just curious.  Thanks!  Edit: words.  Lazy typos.  :)  Edit 2: a word ...again.  :)  edit 3: holy crap.  This is a bunch of nonsense.  It doesn\'t even make sense.  Sorry.  :-(  EDIT 4: a group of words ...still no clue what this means.  Is it just a different way to say "the office"?  That seems like quite an unusual definition for the word "office."  So, what else would it mean?  For example, "a joint venture between two organizations to bring a product or service to market" does that mean anything in particular? ', 132)
